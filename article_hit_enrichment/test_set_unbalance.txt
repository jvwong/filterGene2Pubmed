"30595435"	"Condensin-Dependent Chromatin Compaction Represses Transcription Globally during Quiescence.Quiescence is a stress-resistant state in which cells reversibly exit the cell cycle and suspend most processes. Quiescence is essential for stem cell maintenance, and its misregulation is implicated in tumor formation. One of the hallmarks of quiescent cells is highly condensed chromatin. Because condensed chromatin often correlates with transcriptional silencing, it has been hypothesized that chromatin compaction represses transcription during quiescence. However, the technology to test this model by determining chromatin structure within cells at gene resolution has not previously been available. Here, we use Micro-C XL to map chromatin contacts at single-nucleosome resolution genome-wide in quiescent Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We describe chromatin domains on the order of 10-60 kilobases that, only in quiescent cells, are formed by condensin-mediated loops. Condensin depletion prevents the compaction of chromatin within domains and leads to widespread transcriptional de-repression. Finally, we demonstrate that condensin-dependent chromatin compaction is conserved in quiescent human fibroblasts."	0

In a recent issue of Science, Kam et al. (2018) revealed a feedforward loop in which α-synuclein increases the levels of poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) (PAR) that in turn causes α-synuclein aggregates to be more toxic.

"31968240"	"Follicular Regulatory T Cells Can Access the Germinal Center Independently of CXCR5.The germinal center (GC) response is critical for generating high-affinity humoral immunity and immunological memory, which forms the basis of successful immunization. Control of the GC response is thought to require follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells, a subset of suppressive Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells located within GCs. Relatively little is known about the exact role of Tfr cells within the GC and how they exert their suppressive function. A unique feature of Tfr cells is their reported CXCR5-dependent localization to the GC. Here, we show that the lack of CXCR5 on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells results in a reduced frequency, but not an absence, of GC-localized Tfr cells. This reduction in Tfr cells is not sufficient to alter the magnitude or output of the GC response. This demonstrates that additional, CXCR5-independent mechanisms facilitate Treg cell homing to the GC."	0

Foreign DNA and RNA sensors must discriminate between self versus non-self nucleic acids, despite their shared building blocks and similar physicochemical properties. Recent structural and biochemical studies suggest that multiple steps of filament-like assembly are required for the functions of several nucleic acid sensors. Here, we discuss ligand discrimination and oligomerization of RIG-I-like receptors, AIM2-like receptors, and cGAS. We discuss how filament-like assembly allows for robust and accurate discrimination of self versus non-self nucleic acids and how these assemblies enable sensing of multiple distinct features in foreign nucleic acids, including structure, length, and modifications. We also discuss how individual receptors differ in their assembly and disassembly mechanisms and how these differences contribute to the diversity in nucleic acid specificity and pathogen detection strategies."	0

Here, we identified TMEM63B as an osmosensitive NSCC activated by hypotonic stress. TMEM63B is enriched in the inner ear sensory hair cells. Genetic deletion of TMEM63B results in necroptosis of outer hair cells (OHCs) and progressive hearing loss. Mechanistically, the TMEM63B channel mediates hypo-osmolarity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels required for the maintenance of OHC morphology. These findings demonstrate that TMEM63B is an osmosensor of the mammalian inner ear and the long-sought cation channel mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RVD."	0

Although it is well established that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, we lack a full view of the diversity of metabolic programs in cancer cells and an unbiased assessment of the associations between metabolic pathway preferences and other cell-autonomous processes. Here, we quantified metabolic features, mostly from the <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of molecules from central carbon metabolism, in over 80 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines cultured under identical conditions. Because these cell lines were extensively annotated for oncogenotype, gene expression, protein expression, and therapeutic sensitivity, the resulting database enables the user to uncover new relationships between metabolism and these orthogonal processes."	0
"31968259"	"Inactivation Kinetics and Mechanical Gating of Piezo1 Ion Channels Depend on Subdomains within the Cap.Piezo1 ion channels are activated by mechanical stimuli and mediate the sensing of blood flow. Although cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have revealed the overall architecture of Piezo1, the precise domains involved in activation and subsequent inactivation have remained elusive. Here, we perform a targeted chimeric screen between Piezo1 and the closely related isoform Piezo2 and use electrophysiology to characterize their inactivation kinetics during mechanical stimulation. We identify three small subdomains within the extracellular cap that individually can confer the distinct kinetics of inactivation of Piezo2 onto Piezo1. We further show by cysteine crosslinking that conformational flexibility of these subdomains is required for mechanical activation to occur and that electrostatic interactions functionally couple the cap to the extensive blades, which have been proposed to function as sensors of membrane curvature and tension. This study provides a demonstration of internal gating motions involved in mechanotransduction by Piezo1."	0
"32348758"	"Region-Specific Proteome Changes of the Intestinal Epithelium during Aging and Dietary Restriction.The small intestine is responsible for nutrient absorption and one of the most important interfaces between the environment and the body. During aging, changes of the epithelium lead to food malabsorption and reduced barrier function, thus increasing disease risk. The drivers of these alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we compare the proteomes of intestinal crypts from mice across different anatomical regions and ages. We find that aging alters epithelial immunity, metabolism, and cell proliferation and is accompanied by region-dependent skewing in the cellular composition of the epithelium. Of note, short-term dietary restriction followed by refeeding partially restores the epithelium by promoting stem cell differentiation toward the secretory lineage. We identify Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [CoA] synthetase 2), the rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis, as a modulator of stem cell differentiation that responds to dietary changes, and we provide an atlas of region- and age-dependent proteome changes of the small intestine."	0
"32139422"	"The senotherapeutic drug ABT-737 disrupts aberrant p21 expression to restore liver regeneration in adult mice.Young mammals possess a limited regenerative capacity in some tissues, which is lost upon maturation. We investigated whether cellular senescence might play a role in such loss during liver regeneration. We found that following partial hepatectomy, the senescence-associated genes p21, p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>, and p19<sup>Arf</sup> become dynamically expressed in different cell types when regenerative capacity decreases, but without a full senescent response. However, we show that treatment with a senescence-inhibiting drug improves regeneration, by disrupting aberrantly prolonged p21 expression. This work suggests that senescence may initially develop from heterogeneous cellular responses, and that senotherapeutic drugs might be useful in promoting organ regeneration."	0
"31732456"	"Epigenetic Regulator CoREST Controls Social Behavior in Ants.Ants acquire distinct morphological and behavioral phenotypes arising from a common genome, underscoring the importance of epigenetic regulation. In Camponotus floridanus, ""Major"" workers defend the colony, but can be epigenetically reprogrammed to forage for food analogously to ""Minor"" workers. Here, we utilize reprogramming to investigate natural behavioral specification. Reprogramming of Majors upregulates Minor-biased genes and downregulates Major-biased genes, engaging molecular pathways fundamental to foraging behavior. We discover the neuronal corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST) is upregulated upon reprogramming and required for the epigenetic switch to foraging. Genome-wide profiling during reprogramming reveals CoREST represses expression of enzymes that degrade juvenile hormone (JH), a hormone elevated upon reprogramming. High CoREST, low JH-degrader expression, and high JH levels are mirrored in natural Minors, revealing parallel mechanisms of natural and reprogrammed foraging. These results unveil chromatin regulation via CoREST as central to programming of ant social behavior, with potential far-reaching implications for behavioral epigenetics."	0
"31968249"	"The Mitochondrial Protein MAVS Stabilizes p53 to Suppress Tumorigenesis.Recent reports have shown the critical role of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein in virus-induced apoptosis, but the involvement of MAVS in tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Herein, we report that MAVS is a key regulator of p53 activation and is critical for protecting against tumorigenesis. We find that MAVS promotes p53-dependent cell death in response to DNA damage. MAVS interacts with p53 and mediates p53 mitochondrial recruitment under genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, MAVS inhibits p53 ubiquitination by blocking the formation of the p53-murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) complex, leading to the stabilization of p53. Notably, compared with their wild-type littermates, MAVS knockout mice display decreased resistance to azoxymethane (AOM) or AOM/dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced colon cancer. MAVS expression is significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues. These results unveil roles for MAVS in DNA damage response and tumor suppression."	1
"32029455"	"PARP and PARG inhibitors in cancer treatment.Oxidative and replication stress underlie genomic instability of cancer cells. Amplifying genomic instability through radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been a powerful but nonselective means of killing cancer cells. Precision medicine has revolutionized cancer therapy by putting forth the concept of selective targeting of cancer cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a successful example of precision medicine as the first drugs targeting DNA damage response to have entered the clinic. PARP inhibitors act through synthetic lethality with mutations in DNA repair genes and were approved for the treatment of <i>BRCA</i> mutated ovarian and breast cancer. PARP inhibitors destabilize replication forks through PARP DNA entrapment and induce cell death through replication stress-induced mitotic catastrophe. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) exploit and exacerbate replication deficiencies of cancer cells and may complement PARP inhibitors in targeting a broad range of cancer types with different sources of genomic instability. Here I provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of PARP and PARG inhibition. I highlight clinical performance of four PARP inhibitors used in cancer therapy (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib) and discuss the predictive biomarkers of inhibitor sensitivity, mechanisms of resistance as well as the means of overcoming them through combination therapy."	0
"31151856"	"Arc Oligomerization Is Regulated by CaMKII Phosphorylation of the GAG Domain: An Essential Mechanism for Plasticity and Memory Formation.Arc is a synaptic protein essential for memory consolidation. Recent studies indicate that Arc originates in evolution from a Ty3-Gypsy retrotransposon GAG domain. The N-lobe of Arc GAG domain acquired a hydrophobic binding pocket in higher vertebrates that is essential for Arc's canonical function to weaken excitatory synapses. Here, we report that Arc GAG also acquired phosphorylation sites that can acutely regulate its synaptic function. CaMKII phosphorylates the N-lobe of the Arc GAG domain and disrupts an interaction surface essential for high-order oligomerization. In Purkinje neurons, CaMKII phosphorylation acutely reverses Arc's synaptic action. Mutant Arc that cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKII enhances metabotropic receptor-dependent depression in the hippocampus but does not alter baseline synaptic transmission or long-term potentiation. Behavioral studies indicate that hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning requires Arc GAG domain phosphorylation. These studies provide an atomic model for dynamic and local control of Arc function underlying synaptic plasticity and memory."	0

"32753669"	"Endosomal membrane tension regulates ESCRT-III-dependent intra-lumenal vesicle formation.The plasma membrane tension strongly affects cell surface processes, such as migration, endocytosis and signalling. However, it is not known whether the membrane tension of organelles regulates their functions, notably intracellular traffic. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III complex is the major membrane remodelling complex that drives intra-lumenal-vesicle (ILV) formation on endosomal membranes. Here we used a fluorescent membrane-tension probe to show that ESCRT-III subunits are recruited onto endosomal membranes when the membrane tension is reduced. We find that tension-dependent recruitment is associated with ESCRT-III polymerization and membrane deformation in vitro and correlates with increased ILV formation in ESCRT-III-decorated endosomes in vivo. Finally, we find that the endosomal membrane tension decreases when ILV formation is triggered by EGF under physiological conditions. These results indicate that membrane tension is a major regulator of ILV formation and endosome trafficking, leading us to conclude that membrane tension can control organelle functions."	0
"30948266"	"Gain of Additional BIRC3 Protein Functions through 3'-UTR-Mediated Protein Complex Formation.Alternative 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) are widespread, but their functional roles are largely unknown. We investigated the function of the long BIRC3 3' UTR, which is upregulated in leukemia. The 3' UTR does not regulate BIRC3 protein localization or abundance but is required for CXCR4-mediated B cell migration. We established an experimental pipeline to study the mechanism of regulation and used mass spectrometry to identify BIRC3 protein interactors. In addition to 3'-UTR-independent interactors involved in known BIRC3 functions, we detected interactors that bind only to BIRC3 protein encoded from the mRNA with the long 3' UTR. They regulate several functions, including CXCR4 trafficking. We further identified RNA-binding proteins differentially bound to the alternative 3' UTRs and found that cooperative binding of Staufen and HuR mediates 3'-UTR-dependent complex formation. We show that the long 3' UTR is required for the formation of specific protein complexes that enable additional functions of BIRC3 protein beyond its 3'-UTR-independent functions."	0

Here, through a mini-screen, we identified the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 2 (ORP2) as a novel mediator of selective cholesterol delivery to the PM. Interestingly, ORP2-mediated enrichment of PM cholesterol was coupled with the removal of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) from the PM. ORP2 overexpression or deficiency impacted the levels of PM cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and ORP2 efficiently transferred both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>in vitro. We determined the structure of ORP2 in complex with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at 2.7 Å resolution. ORP2 formed a stable tetramer in the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and tetramerization was required for ORP2 to transfer PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Our results identify a novel pathway for cholesterol delivery to the PM and establish ORP2 as a key regulator of both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> of the PM."	0
"32109364"	"Visualizing the Role of Boundary Elements in Enhancer-Promoter Communication.Formation of self-associating loop domains is a fundamental organizational feature of metazoan genomes. Here, we employed quantitative live-imaging methods to visualize impacts of higher-order chromosome topology on enhancer-promoter communication in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that distal enhancers effectively produce transcriptional bursting from target promoters over distances when they are flanked with boundary elements. Importantly, neither inversion nor deletion of a boundary element abrogates this ""enhancer-assisting activity,"" suggesting that they can facilitate intra-domain enhancer-promoter interaction and production of transcriptional bursting independently of topologically associating domain (TAD) formation. In contrast, domain-skipping activity of distal enhancers was lost after disruption of topological domains. This observation raises a possibility that intra-domain and inter-domain enhancer-promoter interactions are differentially regulated by chromosome topology."	0
"32075754"	"Sen1 Is Recruited to Replication Forks via Ctf4 and Mrc1 and Promotes Genome Stability.DNA replication and RNA transcription compete for the same substrate during S phase. Cells have evolved several mechanisms to minimize such conflicts. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the transcription termination helicase Sen1 associates with replisomes. We show that the N terminus of Sen1 is both sufficient and necessary for replisome association and that it binds to the replisome via the components Ctf4 and Mrc1. We generated a separation of function mutant, sen1-3, which abolishes replisome binding without affecting transcription termination. We observe that the sen1-3 mutants show increased genome instability and recombination levels. Moreover, sen1-3 is synthetically defective with mutations in genes involved in RNA metabolism and the S phase checkpoint. RNH1 overexpression suppresses defects in the former, but not the latter. These findings illustrate how Sen1 plays a key function at replication forks during DNA replication to promote fork progression and chromosome stability."	1
"30709709"	"R-Loops Enhance Polycomb Repression at a Subset of Developmental Regulator Genes.R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that form during transcription, especially over unmethylated CpG-rich promoters of active genes. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), CpG-rich developmental regulator genes are repressed by the Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2. Here, we show that R-loops form at a subset of Polycomb target genes, and we investigate their contribution to Polycomb repression. At R-loop-positive genes, R-loop removal leads to decreased PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment and Pol II activation into a productive elongation state, accompanied by gene derepression at nascent and processed transcript levels. Stable removal of PRC2 derepresses R-loop-negative genes, as expected, but does not affect R-loops, PRC1 recruitment, or transcriptional repression of R-loop-positive genes. Our results highlight that Polycomb repression does not occur via one mechanism but consists of different layers of repression, some of which are gene specific. We uncover that one such mechanism is mediated by an interplay between R-loops and RING1B recruitment."	0
"32023458"	"Methylglyoxal Scavengers Resensitize KRAS-Mutated Colorectal Tumors to Cetuximab.The use of cetuximab anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies has opened the era of targeted and personalized therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). Poor response rates have been unequivocally shown in mutant KRAS and are even observed in a majority of wild-type KRAS tumors. Therefore, patient selection based on mutational profiling remains problematic. We previously identified methylglyoxal (MGO), a by-product of glycolysis, as a metabolite promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Mutant KRAS cells under MGO stress show AKT-dependent survival when compared with wild-type KRAS isogenic CRC cells. MGO induces AKT activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) and Hsp27 regulation. Importantly, the sole induction of MGO stress in sensitive wild-type KRAS cells renders them resistant to cetuximab. MGO scavengers inhibit AKT and resensitize KRAS-mutated CRC cells to cetuximab in vivo. This study establishes a link between MGO and AKT activation and pinpoints this oncometabolite as a potential target to tackle EGFR-targeted therapy resistance in CRC."	0

While numerous studies have identified somatic correlates of immune infiltration, germline features that associate with immune infiltrates in cancers remain incompletely characterized. We analyze seven million autosomal germline variants in the TCGA cohort and test for association with established immune-related phenotypes that describe the tumor immune microenvironment. We identify one SNP associated with the amount of infiltrating follicular helper T cells; 23 candidate genes, some of which are involved in cytokine-mediated signaling and others containing cancer-risk SNPs; and networks with genes that are part of the DNA repair and transcription elongation pathways. In addition, we find a positive association between polygenic risk for rheumatoid arthritis and amount of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Overall, we identify multiple germline genetic features associated with tumor-immune phenotypes and develop a framework for probing inherited features that contribute to differences in immune infiltration."	0

"32521274"	"Slow Receptor Binding of the Noncytopathic HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs Is Balanced by Long-Lived Activation State and Efficient Fusion Activity.Many HIV strains downregulate the levels of CD4 receptor on the surface of infected cells to prevent superinfection. In contrast, the rare HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> strain is noncytopathic and has no effect on CD4 expression in infected cells but still replicates as efficiently as more cytopathic strains in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we show that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Env interactions with the CD4 receptor exhibit slow association kinetics, whereas the dissociation kinetics is within the range of cytopathic strains. Despite the resulting 10- to 100-fold decrease in binding affinity, HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs exhibit long-lived activation state and efficient fusion activity. These observations suggest that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs evolved to balance low affinity with an improved and readily triggerable molecular machinery to mediate entry. Resistance to cold exposure, similar to many primary HIV-1 isolates, and to sCD4 neutralization suggests that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs preferentially sample a closed Env conformation. Our data provide insights into the mechanism of HIV entry."	0
"31914383"	"Dopamine Gates Visual Signals in Monkey Prefrontal Cortex Neurons.The neurotransmitter dopamine, which acts via the D1-like receptor (D1R) and D2-like receptor (D2R) family, may play an important role in gating sensory information to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We tested this hypothesis in awake macaques and recorded visual motion-direction tuning functions of single PFC neurons. Using micro-iontophoretic drug application combined with single-unit recordings, we simulated receptor-specific dopaminergic input to the PFC and explored cellular gating mechanisms. We find that stimulating D1Rs, and particularly D2Rs, enhances the single-neuron and population coding quality in PFC neurons. D2R stimulation causes a clear increase of the neurons' responses to the preferred motion direction and a decrease to the non-preferred motion direction, thus enhancing neuronal signal-to-noise ratio. Neither D1R nor D2R stimulation had any impact on the neurons' tuning sharpness. These results elucidate the mechanisms of how receptor-specific dopamine effects can act as a gating signal that enables privileged access of sensory information to PFC circuits."	0
"32139423"	"The adrenergic-induced ERK3 pathway drives lipolysis and suppresses energy dissipation.Obesity-induced diabetes affects >400 million people worldwide. Uncontrolled lipolysis (free fatty acid release from adipocytes) can contribute to diabetes and obesity. To identify future therapeutic avenues targeting this pathway, we performed a high-throughput screen and identified the extracellular-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) as a hit. We demonstrated that β-adrenergic stimulation stabilizes ERK3, leading to the formation of a complex with the cofactor MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), thereby driving lipolysis. Mechanistically, we identified a downstream target of the ERK3/MK5 pathway, the transcription factor FOXO1, which promotes the expression of the major lipolytic enzyme ATGL. Finally, we provide evidence that targeted deletion of ERK3 in mouse adipocytes inhibits lipolysis, but elevates energy dissipation, promoting lean phenotype and ameliorating diabetes. Thus, ERK3/MK5 represents a previously unrecognized signaling axis in adipose tissue and an attractive target for future therapies aiming to combat obesity-induced diabetes."	1
"32579928"	"Fibroblast-Derived STC-1 Modulates Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Lung Adenocarcinoma Development.The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of different cell types, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). How these cells interact and contribute to lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. Using <sup>G12D</sup>KRAS- and <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF-driven mouse lung models, we identify the pleiotropic glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a regulator of TAM-TAF interactions. STC1 is secreted by TAFs and suppresses TAM differentiation, at least in part, by sequestering the binding of GRP94, an autocrine macrophage-differentiation-inducing factor, to its cognate scavenger receptors. The accumulation of mature TAMs in the Stc1-deficient lung leads to enhanced secretion of TGF-β1 and, thus, TAF accumulation in the TME. Consistent with the mouse data, in human lung adenocarcinoma, STC1 expression is restricted to myofibroblasts, and a significant increase of naive macrophages is detected in STC1-high compared with STC1-low cases. This work increases our understanding of lung adenocarcinoma development and suggests new approaches for therapeutic targeting of the TME."	1
"30581142"	"Drp1-Zip1 Interaction Regulates Mitochondrial Quality Surveillance System.Mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control process for eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria, can be induced by a response of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial division. However, the coordination between MMP and mitochondrial division for selecting the damaged portion of the mitochondrial network is less understood. Here, we found that MMP is reduced focally at a fission site by the Drp1 recruitment, which is initiated by the interaction of Drp1 with mitochondrial zinc transporter Zip1 and Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry through the Zip1-MCU complex. After division, healthy mitochondria restore MMP levels and participate in the fusion-fission cycle again, but mitochondria that fail to restore MMP undergo mitophagy. Thus, interfering with the interaction between Drp1 and Zip1 blocks the reduction of MMP and the subsequent mitophagic selection of damaged mitochondria. These results suggest that Drp1-dependent fission provides selective pressure for eliminating ""bad sectors"" in the mitochondrial network, serving as a mitochondrial quality surveillance system."	1
"32191872"	"Ago2-Dependent Processing Allows miR-451 to Evade the Global MicroRNA Turnover Elicited during Erythropoiesis.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are sequentially processed by two RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. miR-451 is the only known miRNA whose processing bypasses Dicer and instead relies on the slicer activity of Argonaute-2 (Ago2). miR-451 is highly conserved in vertebrates and regulates erythrocyte maturation, where it becomes the most abundant miRNA. However, the basis for the non-canonical biogenesis of miR-451 is unclear. Here, we show that Ago2 is less efficient than Dicer in processing pre-miRNAs, but this deficit is overcome when miR-144 represses Dicer in a negative-feedback loop during erythropoiesis. Loss of miR-144-mediated Dicer repression in zebrafish embryos and human cells leads to increased canonical miRNA production and impaired miR-451 maturation. Overexpression of Ago2 rescues some of the defects of miR-451 processing. Thus, the evolution of Ago2-dependent processing allows miR-451 to circumvent the global repression of canonical miRNAs elicited, in part, by the miR-144 targeting of Dicer during erythropoiesis."	1

Here, we study a highly specialized small object motion detector, LC11, and demonstrate that its responses are suppressed by local background motion. We show that LC11 expresses GABA-A receptors that serve to sculpt responses to small objects but are not responsible for the rejection of background motion. Instead, LC11 is innervated by columnar T2 and T3 neurons that are themselves highly sensitive to small static or moving objects, insensitive to wide-field motion and, unlike T4/T5, respond to both ON and OFF luminance steps."	0
"32587090"	"The WD40-repeat protein WDR-48 promotes the stability of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP-46 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation.Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification that has emerged as a critical regulator of synapse development and function. However, the mechanisms that regulate the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins are poorly understood. We have previously shown that the DUB ubiquitin-specific protease 46 (USP-46) removes ubiquitin from the glutamate receptor GLR-1 and regulates its trafficking and degradation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> We found that the WD40-repeat proteins WDR-20 and WDR-48 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of USP-46.

We found that increased expression of WDR-48, but not WDR-20, promotes USP-46 abundance in mammalian cells in culture and in <i>C. elegans</i> neurons <i>in vivo</i> Inhibition of the proteasome increased USP-46 abundance, and this effect was nonadditive with increased WDR-48 expression. We found that USP-46 is ubiquitinated and that expression of WDR-48 reduces the levels of ubiquitin-USP-46 conjugates and increases the <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> of USP-46. A point-mutated WDR-48 variant that disrupts binding to USP-46 was unable to promote USP-46 abundance <i>in vivo</i> Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>wdr48</i> destabilizes USP46 in mammalian cells. Together, these results support a model in which WDR-48 binds and stabilizes USP-46 protein levels by preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of USP-46 in the proteasome. Given that a large number of USPs interact with WDR proteins, we propose that stabilization of DUBs by their interacting WDR proteins may be a conserved and widely used mechanism that controls DUB availability and function."	1
"32645368"	"Systematic Discovery of Short Linear Motifs Decodes Calcineurin Phosphatase Signaling.Short linear motifs (SLiMs) drive dynamic protein-protein interactions essential for signaling, but sequence degeneracy and low binding affinities make them difficult to identify.

Because of its previous associations with metabolic and transcriptional memory, as well as the importance of H3 histone lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) to innate immune memory, we hypothesize that the Set7 methyltransferase has an important role in trained immunity induced by β-glucan. Using pharmacological studies of human primary monocytes, we identify trained immunity-specific immunometabolic pathways regulated by Set7, including a previously unreported H3K4me1-dependent plasticity in the induction of oxidative phosphorylation. Recapitulation of β-glucan training in vivo additionally identifies Set7-dependent changes in gene expression previously associated with the modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors in trained immunity. By revealing Set7 as a key regulator of trained immunity, these findings provide mechanistic insight into sustained metabolic changes and underscore the importance of characterizing regulatory circuits of innate immune memory."	0
"31806350"	"The ER-Localized Transmembrane Protein TMEM39A/SUSR2 Regulates Autophagy by Controlling the Trafficking of the PtdIns(4)P Phosphatase SAC1.TMEM39A, encoding an ER-localized transmembrane protein, is a susceptibility locus for multiple autoimmune diseases. The molecular function of TMEM39A remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrated that TMEM39A, also called SUSR2, modulates autophagy activity by regulating the spatial distribution and levels of PtdIns(4)P. Depletion of SUSR2 elevates late endosomal/lysosomal PtdIns(4)P levels, facilitating recruitment of the HOPS complex to promote assembly of the SNARE complex for autophagosome maturation. SUSR2 knockdown also increases the degradative capability of lysosomes. Mechanistically, SUSR2 interacts with the ER-localized PtdIns(4)P phosphatase SAC1 and also the COPII SEC23/SEC24 subunits to promote the ER-to-Golgi transport of SAC1. Retention of SAC1 on the ER in SUSR2 knockdown cells increases the level of PtdIns(3)P produced by the VPS34 complex, promoting autophagosome formation. Our study reveals that TMEM39A/SUSR2 acts as an adaptor protein for efficient export of SAC1 from the ER and provides insights into the pathogenesis of diseases associated with TMEM39A mutations."	0
"31101499"	"Targeted and Persistent 8-Oxoguanine Base Damage at Telomeres Promotes Telomere Loss and Crisis.Telomeres are essential for genome stability. Oxidative stress caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accelerates telomere shortening. Although telomeres are hypersensitive to ROS-mediated 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation, the biological effect of this common lesion at telomeres is poorly understood because ROS have pleiotropic effects. Here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that selectively produces 8-oxoG only at telomeres. Acute telomeric 8-oxoG formation increased telomere fragility in cells lacking OGG1, the enzyme that removes 8-oxoG, but did not compromise cell survival. However, chronic telomeric 8-oxoG induction over time shortens telomeres and impairs cell growth. Accumulation of telomeric 8-oxoG in chronically exposed OGG1-deficient cells triggers replication stress, as evidenced by mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, and significantly increases telomere losses. These losses generate chromosome fusions, leading to chromatin bridges and micronucleus formation upon cell division. By confining base damage to the telomeres, we show that telomeric 8-oxoG accumulation directly drives telomere crisis."	0
"30745087"	"Deciphering the Molecular Mechanism Underpinning Phage Arbitrium Communication Systems.Bacillus phages use a communication system, termed ""arbitrium,"" to coordinate lysis-lysogeny decisions. Arbitrium communication is mediated by the production and secretion of a hexapeptide (AimP) during lytic cycle. Once internalized, AimP reduces the expression of the negative regulator of lysogeny, AimX, by binding to the transcription factor, AimR, promoting lysogeny. We have elucidated the crystal structures of AimR from the Bacillus subtilis SPbeta phage in its apo form, bound to its DNA operator and in complex with AimP. AimR presents intrinsic plasticity, sharing structural features with the RRNPP quorum-sensing family. Remarkably, AimR binds to an unusual operator with a long spacer that interacts nonspecifically with the receptor TPR domain, while the HTH domain canonically recognizes two inverted repeats. AimP stabilizes a compact conformation of AimR that approximates the DNA-recognition helices, preventing AimR binding to the aimX promoter region. Our results establish the molecular basis of the arbitrium communication system."	0
"32587092"	"High-speed atomic force microscopy directly visualizes conformational dynamics of the HIV Vif protein in complex with three host proteins.Vif (viral infectivity factor) is a protein that is essential for the replication of the HIV-1 virus. The key function of Vif is to disrupt the antiviral activity of host APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3) proteins, which mutate viral nucleic acids. Inside the cell, Vif binds to the host cell proteins Elongin-C, Elongin-B, and core-binding factor subunit β, forming a four-protein complex called VCBC. The structure of VCBC-Cullin5 has recently been solved by X-ray crystallography, and, using molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of VCBC have been characterized. Here, we applied time-lapse high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize the conformational changes of the VCBC complex. We determined the three most favorable conformations of this complex, which we identified as the triangle, dumbbell, and globular structures. Moreover, we characterized the dynamics of each of these structures. Our data revealed the very dynamic behavior of all of them, with the triangle and dumbbell structures being the most dynamic. These findings provide insight into the structure and dynamics of the VCBC complex and may support efforts to improve HIV treatment, because Vif is essential for virus survival in the cell."	0
"32187537"	"Biased Connectivity of Brain-wide Inputs to Ventral Subiculum Output Neurons.The ventral subiculum (vS) of the mouse hippocampus coordinates diverse behaviors through heterogeneous populations of pyramidal neurons that project to multiple distinct downstream regions. Each of these populations of neurons is proposed to integrate a unique combination of thousands of local and long-range synaptic inputs, but the extent to which this occurs remains unknown. To address this, we employ monosynaptic rabies tracing to study the input-output relationship of vS neurons. Analysis of brain-wide inputs reveals quantitative input differences that could be explained by a combination of both the identity of the downstream target and the spatial location of the postsynaptic neurons within vS. These results support a model of combined topographical and output-defined connectivity of vS inputs. Overall, we reveal prominent heterogeneity in brain-wide inputs to the vS parallel output circuitry, providing a basis for the selective control of individual projections during behavior."	0
"32579940"	"CD28 Regulates Metabolic Fitness for Long-Lived Plasma Cell Survival.Durable humoral immunity against epidemic infectious disease requires the survival of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). LLPC longevity is dependent on metabolic programs distinct from short-lived plasma cells (SLPCs); however, the mechanistic basis for this difference is unclear. We have previously shown that CD28, the prototypic T cell costimulatory receptor, is expressed on both LLPCs and SLPCs but is essential only for LLPC survival. Here we show that CD28 transduces pro-survival signaling specifically in LLPCs through differential SLP76 expression. CD28 signaling in LLPCs increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial mass/respiration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Unexpectedly, CD28-mediated regulation of mitochondrial respiration, NF-κB activation, and survival was ROS dependent. IRF4, a target of NF-κB, was upregulated by CD28 activation in LLPCs and decreased IRF4 levels correlated with decreased glucose uptake, mitochondrial mass, ROS, and CD28-mediated survival. Altogether, these data demonstrate that CD28 signaling induces a ROS-dependent metabolic program required for LLPC survival."	1

The structural diversity of the modified nucleosides provides regulatory potential to sort groups of RNAs for organized metabolism and functions, thus affecting gene expression. Recent years have witnessed a burst of interest in and understanding of RNA modification biology, thanks to the emerging transcriptome-wide sequencing methods for mapping modified sites, highly sensitive mass spectrometry for precise modification detection and quantification, and extensive characterization of the modification ""effectors,"" including enzymes (""writers"" and ""erasers"") that alter the modification level and binding proteins (""readers"") that recognize the chemical marks. However, challenges remain due to the vast heterogeneity in expression abundance of different RNA species, further complicated by divergent cell-type-specific and tissue-specific expression and localization of the effectors as well as modifications. In this review, we highlight recent progress in understanding the function of N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), the most abundant internal mark on eukaryotic mRNA, in light of the specific biological contexts of m<sup>6</sup>A effectors.

"32611771"	"TOR complex 2 (TORC2) signaling and the ESCRT machinery cooperate in the protection of plasma membrane integrity in yeast.The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) mediate evolutionarily conserved membrane remodeling processes. Here, we used budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) to explore how the ESCRT machinery contributes to plasma membrane (PM) homeostasis. We found that in response to reduced membrane tension and inhibition of TOR complex 2 (TORC2), ESCRT-III/Vps4 assemblies form at the PM and help maintain membrane integrity. In turn, the growth of ESCRT mutants strongly depended on TORC2-mediated homeostatic regulation of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism. This was caused by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of Orm2, a repressor of SL biosynthesis. Calcineurin activity impaired Orm2 export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thereby hampered its subsequent endosome and Golgi-associated degradation (EGAD). The ensuing accumulation of Orm2 at the ER in ESCRT mutants necessitated TORC2 signaling through its downstream kinase Ypk1, which repressed Orm2 and prevented a detrimental imbalance of SL metabolism. Our findings reveal compensatory cross-talk between the ESCRT machinery, calcineurin/TORC2 signaling, and the EGAD pathway important for the regulation of SL biosynthesis and the maintenance of PM homeostasis."	0
"31402096"	"Bicoid-Dependent Activation of the Target Gene hunchback Requires a Two-Motif Sequence Code in a Specific Basal Promoter.In complex genetic loci, individual enhancers interact most often with specific basal promoters. Here we investigate the activation of the Bicoid target gene hunchback (hb), which contains two basal promoters (P1 and P2). Early in embryogenesis, P1 is silent, while P2 is strongly activated. In vivo deletion of P2 does not cause activation of P1, suggesting that P2 contains intrinsic sequence motifs required for activation. We show that a two-motif code (a Zelda binding site plus TATA) is required and sufficient for P2 activation. Zelda sites are present in the promoters of many embryonically expressed genes, but the combination of Zelda plus TATA does not seem to be a general code for early activation or Bicoid-specific activation per se. Because Zelda sites are also found in Bicoid-dependent enhancers, we propose that simultaneous binding to both enhancers and promoters independently synchronizes chromatin accessibility and facilitates correct enhancer-promoter interactions."	0

Many proteobacteria use AHL to coordinate virulence and biofilm formation in a cell density-dependent manner; thus, AHL-interfering enzymes constitute new promising antimicrobial candidates. Among these, lactonases and acylases have been particularly studied. These enzymes have been isolated from various bacterial, archaeal, or eukaryotic organisms and have been evaluated for their ability to control several pathogens. Engineering studies on these enzymes were carried out and successfully modulated their capacity to interact with specific AHL, increase their catalytic activity and stability, or enhance their biotechnological potential. In this review, special attention is paid to the screening, engineering, and applications of AHL-modifying enzymes. Prospects and future opportunities are also discussed with a view to developing potent candidates for bacterial control."	0
"32075732"	"Pulsatile MAPK Signaling Modulates p53 Activity to Control Cell Fate Decisions at the G2 Checkpoint for DNA Damage.Cell-autonomous changes in p53 expression govern the duration and outcome of cell-cycle arrest at the G2 checkpoint for DNA damage. Here, we report that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling integrates extracellular cues with p53 dynamics to determine cell fate at the G2 checkpoint. Optogenetic tools and quantitative cell biochemistry reveal transient oscillations in MAPK activity dependent on ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase after DNA damage. MAPK inhibition alters p53 dynamics and p53-dependent gene expression after checkpoint enforcement, prolonging G2 arrest. In contrast, sustained MAPK signaling induces the phosphorylation of CDC25C, and consequently, the accumulation of pro-mitotic kinases, thereby relaxing checkpoint stringency and permitting cells to evade prolonged G2 arrest and senescence induction. We propose a model in which this MAPK-mediated mechanism integrates extracellular cues with cell-autonomous p53-mediated signals, to safeguard genomic integrity during tissue proliferation. Early steps in oncogene-driven carcinogenesis may imbalance this tumor-suppressive mechanism to trigger genome instability."	0
"32402272"	"Neural Correlates of Multisensory Detection Behavior: Comparison of Primary and Higher-Order Visual Cortex.We act upon stimuli in our surrounding environment by gathering the multisensory information they convey and by integrating this information to decide on a behavioral action. We hypothesized that the anterolateral secondary visual cortex (area AL) of the mouse brain may serve as a hub for sensorimotor transformation of audiovisual information. We imaged neuronal activity in primary visual cortex (V1) and AL of the mouse during a detection task using visual, auditory, and audiovisual stimuli. We found that AL neurons were more sensitive to weak uni- and multisensory stimuli compared to V1. Depending on contrast, different subsets of AL and V1 neurons showed cross-modal modulation of visual responses. During audiovisual stimulation, AL neurons showed stronger differentiation of behaviorally reported versus unreported stimuli compared to V1, whereas V1 showed this distinction during unisensory visual stimulation. Thus, neural population activity in area AL correlates more closely with multisensory detection behavior than V1."	0
"32755587"	"A Switch in p53 Dynamics Marks Cells That Escape from DSB-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest.Cellular responses to stimuli can evolve over time, resulting in distinct early and late phases in response to a single signal. DNA damage induces a complex response that is largely orchestrated by the transcription factor p53, whose dynamics influence whether a damaged cell will arrest and repair the damage or will initiate cell death. How p53 responses and cellular outcomes evolve in the presence of continuous DNA damage remains unknown. Here, we have found that a subset of cells switches from oscillating to sustained p53 dynamics several days after undergoing damage. The switch results from cell cycle progression in the presence of damaged DNA, which activates the caspase-2-PIDDosome, a complex that stabilizes p53 by inactivating its negative regulator MDM2. This work defines a molecular pathway that is activated if the canonical checkpoints fail to halt mitosis in the presence of damaged DNA."	0
"32460018"	"Global Regulatory DNA Potentiation by SMARCA4 Propagates to Selective Gene Expression Programs via Domain-Level Remodeling.The human genome encodes millions of regulatory elements, of which only a small fraction are active within a given cell type. Little is known about the global impact of chromatin remodelers on regulatory DNA landscapes and how this translates to gene expression. We use precision genome engineering to reawaken homozygously inactivated SMARCA4, a central ATPase of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Here, we combine DNase I hypersensitivity, histone modification, and transcriptional profiling to show that SMARCA4 dramatically increases both the number and magnitude of accessible chromatin sites genome-wide, chiefly by unmasking sites of low regulatory factor occupancy. By contrast, transcriptional changes are concentrated within well-demarcated remodeling domains wherein expression of specific genes is gated by both distal element activation and promoter chromatin configuration. Our results provide a perspective on how global chromatin remodeling activity is translated to gene expression via regulatory DNA."	0

The two enriched in arginine, poly(GR) and poly(PR), infiltrate liquid-like nucleoli, co-localize with the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM1), and alter the phase separation behavior of NPM1 in vitro. Here, we show that poly(PR) DPRs bind tightly to a long acidic tract within the intrinsically disordered region of NPM1, altering its phase separation with nucleolar partners to the extreme of forming large, soluble complexes that cause droplet dissolution in vitro. In cells, poly(PR) DPRs disperse NPM1 from nucleoli and entrap rRNA in static condensates in a DPR-length-dependent manner. We propose that R-rich DPR toxicity involves disrupting the role of phase separation by NPM1 in organizing ribosomal proteins and RNAs within the nucleolus."	0
"32259483"	"Cohesin Causes Replicative DNA Damage by Trapping DNA Topological Stress.DNA topological stress inhibits DNA replication fork (RF) progression and contributes to DNA replication stress. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that centromeric DNA and the rDNA array are especially vulnerable to DNA topological stress during replication. The activity of the SMC complexes cohesin and condensin are linked to both the generation and repair of DNA topological-stress-linked damage in these regions. At cohesin-enriched centromeres, cohesin activity causes the accumulation of DNA damage, RF rotation, and pre-catenation, confirming that cohesin-dependent DNA topological stress impacts on normal replication progression. In contrast, at the rDNA, cohesin and condensin activity inhibit the repair of damage caused by DNA topological stress. We propose that, as well as generally acting to ensure faithful genetic inheritance, SMCs can disrupt genome stability by trapping DNA topological stress."	0
"32101733"	"Structural Insights into Rational Design of Single-Domain Antibody-Based Antitoxins against Botulinum Neurotoxins.Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is one of the most acutely lethal toxins known to humans, and effective treatment for BoNT intoxication is urgently needed. Single-domain antibodies (VHH) have been examined as a countermeasure for BoNT because of their high stability and ease of production. Here, we investigate the structures and the neutralization mechanisms for six unique VHHs targeting BoNT/A1 or BoNT/B1. These studies reveal diverse neutralizing mechanisms by which VHHs prevent host receptor binding or block transmembrane delivery of the BoNT protease domain. Guided by this knowledge, we design heterodimeric VHHs by connecting two neutralizing VHHs via a flexible spacer so they can bind simultaneously to the toxin. These bifunctional VHHs display much greater potency in a mouse co-intoxication model than similar heterodimers unable to bind simultaneously. Taken together, our studies offer insight into antibody neutralization of BoNTs and advance our ability to design multivalent anti-pathogen VHHs with improved therapeutic properties."	0
"32610140"	"Caspase Activation and Caspase-Mediated Cleavage of APP Is Associated with Amyloid β-Protein-Induced Synapse Loss in Alzheimer's Disease.Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) toxicity is hypothesized to play a seminal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how Aβ causes synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. We hypothesize that one mechanism of Aβ-induced synaptic injury is related to the cleavage of amyloid β precursor protein (APP) at position D664 by caspases that release the putatively cytotoxic C31 peptide. In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, Aβ-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of Aβ toxicity. Loss of dendritic spines is also attenuated in mice treated with caspase inhibitors. Importantly, the time-dependent dendritic spine loss is correlated with localized activation of caspase-3 but is absent in APP D664A cultures. We propose that the APP cytosolic domain plays an essential role in Aβ-induced synaptic damage in the injury pathway mediated by localized caspase activation."	0

Here, we present a comprehensive mass-spectrometry-based analysis of a human kinase interaction network covering more than 300 kinases. The interaction dataset is a high-quality resource with more than 5,000 previously unreported interactions. We extensively characterized the obtained network and were able to identify previously described, as well as predict new, kinase functional associations, including those of the less well-studied kinases PIM3 and protein O-mannose kinase (POMK).

"32610124"	"Mapping of Influenza Virus RNA-RNA Interactions Reveals a Flexible Network.Selective assembly of influenza virus segments into virions is proposed to be mediated through intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. Here, we developed a method called 2CIMPL that includes proximity ligation under native conditions to identify genome-wide RNA duplexes. Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation. Overall, 2CIMPL is a versatile technique to map in vivo RNA-RNA interactions."	0
"31400850"	"RAD51AP1 Is an Essential Mediator of Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres.Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism of telomere elongation that controls proliferation in aggressive cancers. We show that the disruption of RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) in ALT+ cancer cells leads to generational telomere shortening. This is due to RAD51AP1's involvement in RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) and RAD52-POLD3-dependent break induced DNA synthesis. RAD51AP1 KO ALT+ cells exhibit telomere dysfunction and cytosolic telomeric DNA fragments that are sensed by cGAS. Intriguingly, they activate ULK1-ATG7-dependent autophagy as a survival mechanism to mitigate DNA damage and apoptosis. Importantly, RAD51AP1 protein levels are elevated in ALT+ cells due to MMS21 associated SUMOylation. Mutation of a single SUMO-targeted lysine residue perturbs telomere dynamics. These findings indicate that RAD51AP1 is an essential mediator of the ALT mechanism and is co-opted by post-translational mechanisms to maintain telomere length and ensure proliferation of ALT+ cancer cells."	0
"30824373"	"Fuzzy Interactions Form and Shape the Histone Transport Complex.Protein transport into the nucleus is mediated by transport receptors. Import of highly charged proteins, such as histone H1 and ribosomal proteins, requires a dimer of two transport receptors. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the Imp7:Impβ:H1.0 complex, showing that the two importins form a cradle that accommodates the linker histone. The H1.0 globular domain is bound to Impβ, whereas the acidic loops of Impβ and Imp7 chaperone the positively charged C-terminal tail. Although it remains disordered, the H1 tail serves as a zipper that closes and stabilizes the structure through transient non-specific interactions with importins. Moreover, we found that the GGxxF and FxFG motifs in the Imp7 C-terminal tail are essential for Imp7:Impβ dimerization and H1 import, resembling importin interaction with nucleoporins, which, in turn, promote complex disassembly. The architecture of many other complexes might be similarly defined by rapidly exchanging electrostatic interactions mediated by disordered regions."	0

Here, we describe a yeast SG reconstitution system that faithfully recapitulates SG assembly in response to trigger RNAs. SGs assembled by stem-loop RNA triggers are ATP-sensitive, regulated by helicase/chaperone activity, and exhibit the hallmarks of maturation observed for SG proteins that phase-separate in vitro. Additionally, the fraction of total RNA that phase-separates in vitro is sufficient to trigger SG formation. However, condensation of NFT1 mRNA, an enriched transcript in this population, can only assemble an incomplete SG.

Our study unveils a specific N-glycosylation pattern used by a chaperone, Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), to alter its conformational fitness and stabilize a state most permissive for stable interactions with proteins at the plasma membrane. This ""protein assembly mutation' remodels protein networks and properties of the cell. We show in cells, human specimens, and mouse xenografts that proteome connectivity is restorable by inhibition of the N-glycosylated GRP94 variant.

Yet, key steps involved in trafficking of antigens taken up by DCs remain incompletely understood. Here, we screen 700 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and identify 37 enhancers of antigen import from endolysosomes into the cytosol. To reveal their mechanism of action, we generate proteomic organellar maps of control and drug-treated DCs (focusing on two compounds, prazosin and tamoxifen). By combining organellar mapping, quantitative proteomics, and microscopy, we conclude that import enhancers undergo lysosomal trapping leading to membrane permeation and antigen release. Enhancing antigen import facilitates cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated antigens. Systemic administration of prazosin leads to reduced growth of MC38 tumors and to a synergistic effect with checkpoint immunotherapy in a melanoma model. Thus, inefficient antigen import into the cytosol limits antigen cross-presentation, restraining the potency of anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of checkpoint blockers."	0

We developed multiplexed enhanced protein dynamics (mePROD) proteomics, adding signal amplification to dynamic-SILAC and multiplexing, to enable measuring acute changes in protein synthesis. Treating cells with ISR/mTORC1-modulating stressors, we showed extensive translatome modulation with ∼20% of proteins synthesized at highly reduced rates. Comparing translation-deficient sub-proteomes revealed an extensive overlap demonstrating that target specificity is achieved on protein level and not by pathway activation. Titrating cap-dependent translation inhibition confirmed that synthesis of individual proteins is controlled by intrinsic properties responding to global translation attenuation.

FKBP10 expression negatively correlates with survival of lung cancer patients, and its downregulation causes a dramatic diminution of lung tumor burden in mice. Mechanistically, our results from gain- and loss-of-function assays show that FKBP10 boosts cancer growth and stemness via its PPIase activity. Also, FKBP10 interacts with ribosomes, and its downregulation leads to reduction of translation elongation at the beginning of open reading frames (ORFs), particularly upon insertion of proline residues. Thus, our data unveil FKBP10 as a cancer-selective molecule with a key role in translational reprogramming, stem-like traits, and growth of lung cancer."	0

The shared and euchromatin-specific proteomes contain proteins involved in DNA and chromatin metabolism and in transcription, respectively. The heterochromatin-specific proteome includes all proteins with known roles in heterochromatin formation and, in addition, is enriched for subsets of nucleoporins and inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins, which associate with different chromatin domains. While the INM proteins are required for the integrity of the nucleolus, containing ribosomal DNA repeats, the nucleoporins are required for aggregation of heterochromatic foci and epigenetic inheritance. The results provide a comprehensive picture of heterochromatin-associated proteins and suggest a role for specific nucleoporins in heterochromatin function."	0

From a forward genetic screen, we uncovered a surprising requirement for the olfactory neuron gene olrn-1 in the regulation of intestinal epithelial immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. During nematode development, olrn-1 is required to program the expression of odorant receptors in the AWC olfactory neuron pair. Here, we show that olrn-1 also functions in AWC neurons in the cell non-autonomous suppression of the canonical p38 MAPK PMK-1 immune pathway in the intestine. Low activity of OLRN-1, which activates the p38 MAPK signaling cassette in AWC neurons during larval development, also de-represses the p38 MAPK PMK-1 pathway in the intestine to promote immune effector transcription, increased clearance of an intestinal pathogen, and resistance to bacterial infection. These data reveal an unexpected connection between olfactory receptor development and innate immunity and show that anti-pathogen defenses in the intestine are developmentally programmed."	0

We find that the deletion of Ebf2 in adipocytes of mice ablates BAT character and function, resulting in cold intolerance. Unexpectedly, prolonged exposure to cold restores the thermogenic profile and function of Ebf2 mutant BAT. Enhancer profiling and genetic assays identified EBF1 as a candidate regulator of the cold response in BAT. Adipocyte-specific deletion of both Ebf1 and Ebf2 abolishes BAT recruitment during chronic cold exposure. Mechanistically, EBF1 and EBF2 promote thermogenic gene transcription through increasing the expression and activity of ERRα and PGC1α. Together, these studies demonstrate that EBF proteins specify the developmental fate and control the adaptive cold response of brown adipocytes."	0
"32023470"	"OTUB1 Is a Key Regulator of RIG-I-Dependent Immune Signaling and Is Targeted for Proteasomal Degradation by Influenza A NS1.Deubiquitylases (DUBs) regulate critical signaling pathways at the intersection of host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Although RIG-I activation is heavily dependent on ubiquitylation, systematic analyses of DUBs that regulate this pathway have not been performed. Using a ubiquitin C-terminal electrophile, we profile DUBs that function during influenza A virus (IAV) infection and isolate OTUB1 as a key regulator of RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Upon infection, OTUB1 relocalizes from the nucleus to mitochondrial membranes together with RIG-I, viral PB2, and NS1. Its expression depends on competing effects of interferon stimulation and IAV-triggered degradation. OTUB1 activates RIG-I via a dual mechanism of K48 polyubiquitin hydrolysis and formation of an E2-repressive complex with UBCH5c. We reconstitute this mechanism in a cell-free system comprising [<sup>35</sup>S]IRF3, purified RIG-I, mitochondrial membranes, and cytosol expressing OTUB1 variants. A range of IAV NS1 proteins trigger proteasomal degradation of OTUB1, antagonizing the RIG-I signaling cascade and antiviral responses."	1
"32234483"	"Non-conventional Axonal Organelles Control TRPM8 Ion Channel Trafficking and Peripheral Cold Sensing.TRPM8 is the main ion channel responsible for cold transduction in the somatosensory system. Nerve terminal availability of TRPM8 determines cold sensitivity, but how axonal secretory organelles control channel delivery remains poorly understood. Here we examine the distribution of TRPM8 and trafficking organelles in cold-sensitive peripheral axons and disrupt trafficking by targeting the ARF-GEF GBF1 pharmacologically or the small GTPase RAB6 by optogenetics. In axons of the sciatic nerve, inhibition of GBF1 interrupts TRPM8 trafficking and increases association with the trans-Golgi network, LAMP1, and Golgi satellites, which distribute profusely along the axonal shaft. Accordingly, both TRPM8-dependent ongoing activity and cold-evoked responses reversibly decline upon GBF1 inhibition in nerve endings of corneal cold thermoreceptors. Inhibition of RAB6, which also associates to Golgi satellites, decreases cold-induced responses in vivo. Our results support a non-conventional axonal trafficking mechanism controlling the availability of TRPM8 in axons and cold sensitivity in the peripheral nervous system."	0
"32649882"	"Tandem Deubiquitination and Acetylation of SPRTN Promotes DNA-Protein Crosslink Repair and Protects against Aging.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that threaten genomic integrity. Recent findings highlight that SPRTN, a specialized DNA-dependent metalloprotease, is a central player in proteolytic cleavage of DPCs. Previous studies suggest that SPRTN deubiquitination is important for its chromatin association and activation. However, the regulation and consequences of SPRTN deubiquitination remain unclear. Here we report that, in response to DPC induction, the deubiquitinase VCPIP1/VCIP135 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM/ATR. VCPIP1, in turn, deubiquitinates SPRTN and promotes its chromatin relocalization. Deubiquitination of SPRTN is required for its subsequent acetylation, which promotes SPRTN relocation to the site of chromatin damage. Furthermore, Vcpip1 knockout mice are prone to genomic instability and premature aging. We propose a model where two sequential post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate SPRTN chromatin accessibility to repair DPCs and maintain genomic stability and a healthy lifespan."	1
"32294432"	"Disentangling Pro-mitotic Signaling during Cell Cycle Progression using Time-Resolved Single-Cell Imaging.Cells rely on input from extracellular growth factors to control their proliferation during development and adult homeostasis. Such mitogenic inputs are transmitted through multiple signaling pathways that synergize to precisely regulate cell cycle entry and progression. Although the architecture of these signaling networks has been characterized in molecular detail, their relative contribution, especially at later cell cycle stages, remains largely unexplored. By combining quantitative time-resolved measurements of fluorescent reporters in untransformed human cells with targeted pharmacological inhibitors and statistical analysis, we quantify epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced signal processing in individual cells over time and dissect the dynamic contribution of downstream pathways. We define signaling features that encode information about extracellular ligand concentrations and critical time windows for inducing cell cycle transitions. We show that both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity are necessary for initial cell cycle entry, whereas only PI3K affects the duration of S phase at later stages of mitogenic signaling."	0
"31378462"	"MISTERMINATE Mechanistically Links Mitochondrial Dysfunction with Proteostasis Failure.Mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis failure frequently coexist as hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease. How these pathologies are related is not well understood. Here, we describe a phenomenon termed MISTERMINATE (mitochondrial-stress-induced translational termination impairment and protein carboxyl terminal extension), which mechanistically links mitochondrial dysfunction with proteostasis failure. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction impairs translational termination of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, including complex-I 30kD subunit (C-I30) mRNA, occurring on the mitochondrial surface in Drosophila and mammalian cells. Ribosomes stalled at the normal stop codon continue to add to the C terminus of C-I30 certain amino acids non-coded by mRNA template. C-terminally extended C-I30 is toxic when assembled into C-I and forms aggregates in the cytosol. Enhancing co-translational quality control prevents C-I30 C-terminal extension and rescues mitochondrial and neuromuscular degeneration in a Parkinson's disease model. These findings emphasize the importance of efficient translation termination and reveal unexpected link between mitochondrial health and proteome homeostasis mediated by MISTERMINATE."	0

Since neural KynA levels dampen learning capacity, KynA reduction has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for conditions of cognitive deficit such as neurodegeneration. While KynA is generated locally within the nervous system, its precursor, kynurenine (Kyn), is largely derived from peripheral resources. The mechanisms that import Kyn into the nervous system are poorly understood. Here, we provide genetic, anatomical, biochemical, and behavioral evidence showing that in <i>C. elegans</i> an ortholog of the human LAT1 transporter, AAT-1, imports Kyn into sites of KynA production."	1
"30975460"	"RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.Nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors perceive pathogen effectors and trigger plant immunity. However, the mechanisms underlying NLR-triggered defense responses remain obscure. The recently discovered Pigm locus in rice encodes a cluster of NLRs, including PigmR, which confers broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus. Here, we identify PIBP1 (PigmR-INTERACTING and BLAST RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1), an RRM (RNA-recognition motif) protein that specifically interacts with PigmR and other similar NLRs to trigger blast resistance. PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance. We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression. Knockout of PIBP1 and Os06 g02240 greatly attenuated blast resistance. Collectively, our study discovers previously unappreciated RRM transcription factors that directly interact with NLRs to activate plant defense, establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of immune responses with NLR-mediated pathogen perception."	0
"32333838"	"DNA Methylation Regulates Alternative Polyadenylation via CTCF and the Cohesin Complex.Dysregulation of DNA methylation and mRNA alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) are both prevalent in cancer and have been studied as independent processes. We discovered a DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism when we compared genome-wide DNA methylation and polyadenylation site usage between DNA methylation-competent and DNA methylation-deficient cells. Here, we show that removal of DNA methylation enables CTCF binding and recruitment of the cohesin complex, which, in turn, form chromatin loops that promote proximal polyadenylation site usage. In this DNA demethylated context, either deletion of the CTCF binding site or depletion of RAD21 cohesin complex protein can recover distal polyadenylation site usage. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we authenticated the relationship between DNA methylation and mRNA polyadenylation isoform expression in vivo. This DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism demonstrates how aberrant DNA methylation impacts transcriptome diversity and highlights the potential sequelae of global DNA methylation inhibition as a cancer treatment."	0
"32640231"	"Neto-α Controls Synapse Organization and Homeostasis at the Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction.Glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins control receptor distribution and function, ultimately controlling synapse assembly, maturation, and plasticity. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse with both pre- and postsynaptic kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), we show that the auxiliary protein Neto evolved functionally distinct isoforms to modulate synapse development and homeostasis. Using genetics, cell biology, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that Neto-α functions on both sides of the NMJ. In muscle, Neto-α limits the size of the postsynaptic receptor field. In motor neurons (MNs), Neto-α controls neurotransmitter release in a KAR-dependent manner. In addition, Neto-α is both required and sufficient for the presynaptic increase in neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic sensitivity. This KAR-independent function of Neto-α is involved in activity-induced cytomatrix remodeling. We propose that Drosophila ensures NMJ functionality by acquiring two Neto isoforms with differential expression patterns and activities."	0
"32464093"	"Insulin- and Lipopolysaccharide-Mediated Signaling in Adipose Tissue Macrophages Regulates Postprandial Glycemia through Akt-mTOR Activation.The physiological role of immune cells in the regulation of postprandial glucose metabolism has not been fully elucidated. We have found that adipose tissue macrophages produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) upon feeding, which suppresses hepatic glucose production in cooperation with insulin. Both elevated insulin and gut-microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide in response to feeding are required for IL-10 production via the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Indeed, myeloid-specific knockout of the insulin receptor or bone marrow transplantation of mutant TLR4 marrow cells results in increased expression of gluconeogenic genes and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, myeloid-specific Akt1 and Akt2 knockout results in similar phenotypes that are rescued by additional knockout of TSC2, an inhibitor of mTOR. In obesity, IL-10 production is impaired due to insulin resistance in macrophages, whereas adenovirus-mediated expression of IL-10 ameliorates postprandial hyperglycemia. Thus, the orchestrated response of the endogenous hormone and gut environment to feeding is a key regulator of postprandial glycemia."	0
"32001510"	"Mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling drives formation of cytoplasmic chromatin and inflammation in senescence.Cellular senescence is a potent tumor suppressor mechanism but also contributes to aging and aging-related diseases. Senescence is characterized by a stable cell cycle arrest and a complex proinflammatory secretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently discovered that cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), extruded from the nucleus of senescent cells, trigger the SASP through activation of the innate immunity cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. However, the upstream signaling events that instigate CCF formation remain unknown. Here, we show that dysfunctional mitochondria, linked to down-regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, trigger a ROS-JNK retrograde signaling pathway that drives CCF formation and hence the SASP. JNK links to 53BP1, a nuclear protein that negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection and CCF formation. Importantly, we show that low-dose HDAC inhibitors restore expression of most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, improve mitochondrial function, and suppress CCFs and the SASP in senescent cells. In mouse models, HDAC inhibitors also suppress oxidative stress, CCF, inflammation, and tissue damage caused by senescence-inducing irradiation and/or acetaminophen-induced mitochondria dysfunction. Overall, our findings outline an extended mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway that initiates formation of CCF during senescence and is a potential target for drug-based interventions to inhibit the proaging SASP."	0
"32433975"	"Type I Interferon Receptor Signaling in Astrocytes Regulates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity and Cognitive Function of the Healthy CNS.Type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling is a hallmark of viral control and host protection. Here, we show that, in the hippocampus of healthy IFNAR-deficient mice, synapse number and synaptic plasticity, as well as spatial learning, are impaired. This is also the case for IFN-β-deficient animals. Moreover, antibody-mediated IFNAR blocking acutely interferes with neuronal plasticity, whereas a low-dose application of IFN-β has a positive effect on dendritic spine structure. Interfering with IFNAR signaling in different cell types shows a role for cognitive function and synaptic plasticity specifically mediated by astrocytes. Intriguingly, levels of the astrocytic glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) are reduced significantly upon IFN-β treatment and increase following inhibition of IFNAR signaling. These results indicate that, besides the prominent role for host defense, IFNAR is important for synaptic plasticity as well as cognitive function. Astrocytes are at the center stage of this so-far-unknown signaling cascade."	0

Here, we engineer the PylT/RS pair encoded by Methanogenic archaeon ISO4-G1 (G1) to be orthogonal to Mma PylT/RS and alter the G1 PylRS active site to accept a complementary ncAA spectrum. We combine the resulting mutual orthogonal pairs for site-specific dual ncAA incorporation of two lysine analogs with high selectivity and efficiency. Demonstrating the robustness of the system, we incorporate two ncAAs with compatible bioorthogonal reactivity into a Notch receptor, as well as a G protein-coupled receptor. We show that selective and site-specific incorporation of two ncAAs allows for two-color bioorthogonal labeling as well as chemical-controlled crosslinking of surface proteins on live mammalian cells."	0

Here we show that the axon guidance cue Netrin-1 promotes naive pluripotency by triggering profound signalling, transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in mESCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 can substitute for blockade of Gsk3α/β and Mek1/2 to sustain self-renewal of mESCs in combination with leukaemia inhibitory factor and regulates the formation of the mouse pluripotent blastocyst. Mechanistically, we reveal how Netrin-1 and the balance of its receptors Neo1 and Unc5B co-regulate Wnt and MAPK pathways in both mouse and human ESCs. Netrin-1 induces Fak kinase to inactivate Gsk3α/β and stabilize β-catenin while increasing the phosphatase activity of a Ppp2r2c-containing Pp2a complex to reduce Erk1/2 activity. Collectively, this work identifies Netrin-1 as a regulator of pluripotency and reveals that it mediates different effects in mESCs depending on its receptor dosage, opening perspectives for balancing self-renewal and lineage commitment."	1
"32348771"	"Intricate Genetic Programs Controlling Dormancy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) displays the remarkable ability to transition in and out of dormancy, a hallmark of the pathogen's capacity to evade the immune system and exploit susceptible individuals. Uncovering the gene regulatory programs that underlie the phenotypic shifts in MTB during disease latency and reactivation has posed a challenge. We develop an experimental system to precisely control dissolved oxygen levels in MTB cultures in order to capture the transcriptional events that unfold as MTB transitions into and out of hypoxia-induced dormancy. Using a comprehensive genome-wide transcription factor binding map and insights from network topology analysis, we identify regulatory circuits that deterministically drive sequential transitions across six transcriptionally and functionally distinct states encompassing more than three-fifths of the MTB genome. The architecture of the genetic programs explains the transcriptional dynamics underlying synchronous entry of cells into a dormant state that is primed to infect the host upon encountering favorable conditions."	0
"30902547"	"RNA Circularization Diminishes Immunogenicity and Can Extend Translation Duration In Vivo.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of single-stranded RNAs with a contiguous structure that have enhanced stability and a lack of end motifs necessary for interaction with various cellular proteins. Here, we show that unmodified exogenous circRNA is able to bypass cellular RNA sensors and thereby avoid provoking an immune response in RIG-I and Toll-like receptor (TLR) competent cells and in mice. The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations are found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to the evasion of TLR sensing. Finally, we provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and we show that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs."	0
"32755596"	"The Lon Protease Links Nucleotide Metabolism with Proteotoxic Stress.During proteotoxic stress, bacteria maintain critical processes like DNA replication while removing misfolded proteins, which are degraded by the Lon protease. Here, we show that in Caulobacter crescentus Lon controls deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools during stress through degradation of the transcription factor CcrM. Elevated dNTP/nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) ratios in Δlon cells protects them from deletion of otherwise essential deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP)-producing pathways and shields them from hydroxyurea-induced loss of dNTPs. Increased dNTP production in Δlon results from higher expression of ribonucleotide reductase driven by increased CcrM. We show that misfolded proteins can stabilize CcrM by competing for limited protease and that Lon-dependent control of dNTPs improves fitness during protein misfolding conditions. We propose that linking dNTP production with availability of Lon allows Caulobacter to maintain replication capacity when misfolded protein burden increases, such as during rapid growth. Because Lon recognizes misfolded proteins regardless of the stress, this mechanism allows for response to a variety of unanticipated conditions."	0

Here, we examine whether immunization formulation associated with enhanced vaccine efficacy promotes antigen targeting and cell recruitment into lymph node (LN) niches associated with optimal type 1 responses. Immunization with antigen and Toll-like receptor agonist emulsified in oil leads to an increased differentiation of IFNγ/TNF-α<sup>+</sup> polyfunctional Th1 cells compared to an identical immunization in saline. Oil immunization results in a rapid delivery and persistence of antigen in interfollicular regions (IFRs) of the LN, whereas without oil, antigen is distributed in the medullary region. Following oil immunization, CXCL10-producing inflammatory monocytes accumulate in the IFR, which mobilizes antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into this niche. In this microenvironment, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are advantageously positioned to encounter arriving IL-12-producing inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs).

"32492426"	"Functional Divergence of the Arabidopsis Florigen-Interacting bZIP Transcription Factors FD and FDP.Flowering of many plant species depends on interactions between basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and systemically transported florigen proteins. Members of the genus Arabidopsis contain two of these bZIPs, FD and FDP, which we show have largely complementary expression patterns in shoot apices before and during flowering. CRISPR-Cas9-induced null mutants for FDP flower slightly earlier than wild-type, whereas fd mutants are late flowering. Identical G-box sequences are enriched at FD and FDP binding sites, but only FD binds to genes involved in flowering and only fd alters their transcription. However, both proteins bind to genes involved in responses to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), which controls developmental and stress responses. Many of these genes are differentially expressed in both fd and fdp mutant seedlings, which also show reduced ABA sensitivity. Thus, florigen-interacting bZIPs have distinct functions in flowering dependent on their expression patterns and, at earlier stages in development, play common roles in phytohormone signaling."	0
"32320669"	"Beta-Catenin Causes Adrenal Hyperplasia by Blocking Zonal Transdifferentiation.Activating mutations in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway are key drivers of hyperplasia, the gateway for tumor development. In a wide range of tissues, this occurs primarily through enhanced effects on cellular proliferation. Whether additional mechanisms contribute to β-catenin-driven hyperplasia remains unknown. The adrenal cortex is an ideal system in which to explore this question, as it undergoes hyperplasia following somatic β-catenin gain-of-function (βcat-GOF) mutations. Targeting βcat-GOF to zona Glomerulosa (zG) cells leads to a progressive hyperplastic expansion in the absence of increased proliferation. Instead, we find that hyperplasia results from a functional block in the ability of zG cells to transdifferentiate into zona Fasciculata (zF) cells. Mechanistically, zG cells demonstrate an upregulation of Pde2a, an inhibitor of zF-specific cAMP/PKA signaling. Hyperplasia is further exacerbated by trophic factor stimulation leading to organomegaly. Together, these data indicate that β-catenin drives adrenal hyperplasia through both proliferation-dependent and -independent mechanisms."	0
"31521506"	"Non-core Subunits of the PRC2 Complex Are Collectively Required for Its Target-Site Specificity.The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes H3K27 methylation across the genome, which impacts transcriptional regulation and is critical for establishment of cell identity. Because of its essential function during development and in cancer, understanding the delineation of genome-wide H3K27 methylation patterns has been the focus of intense investigation. PRC2 methylation activity is abundant and dispersed throughout the genome, but the highest activity is specifically directed to a subset of target sites that are stably occupied by the complex and highly enriched for H3K27me3. Here, we show, by systematically knocking out single and multiple non-core subunits of the PRC2 complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, that they each contribute to directing PRC2 activity to target sites. Furthermore, combined knockout of six non-core subunits reveals that, while dispensable for global H3K27 methylation levels, the non-core PRC2 subunits are collectively required for focusing H3K27me3 activity to specific sites in the genome."	0
"32647012"	"PCBP1 and PCBP2 both bind heavily oxidized RNA but cause opposing outcomes, suppressing or increasing apoptosis under oxidative conditions.PCBP1, a member of the poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP) family, has the capability of binding heavily oxidized RNA and therefore participates in the cellular response to oxidative conditions, helping to induce apoptosis. There are four other members of this family, PCBP2, PCBP3, PCBP4, and hnRNPK, but it is not known whether they play similar roles. To learn more, we first tested their affinity for an RNA strand carrying two 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) residues at sites located in close proximity to each other, representative of a heavily oxidized strand or RNA with one 8-oxoG or none. Among them, only PCBP2 exhibited highly selective binding to RNA carrying two 8-oxoG residues similar to that observed with PCBP1. In contrast, PCBP3, PCBP4, and hnRNPK bound RNA with or without 8-oxoG modifications and exhibited slightly increased binding to the former. Mutations in conserved RNA-binding domains of PCBP2 disrupted the specific interaction with heavily oxidized RNA. We next tested PCBP2 activity in cells. Compared with WT HeLa S3 cells, PCBP2-KO cells established by gene editing exhibited increased apoptosis with increased caspase-3 activity and PARP1 cleavage under oxidative conditions, which were suppressed by the expression of WT PCBP2 but not one of the mutants lacking binding activity. In contrast, PCBP1-KO cells exhibited reduced apoptosis with much less caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage than WT cells. Our results indicate that PCBP2 as well as PCBP1 bind heavily oxidized RNA; however, the former may counteract PCBP1 to suppress apoptosis under oxidative conditions."	0
"32341547"	"Lis1 activates dynein motility by modulating its pairing with dynactin.Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) is a key cofactor for dynein-mediated intracellular transport towards the minus-ends of microtubules. It remains unclear whether Lis1 serves as an inhibitor or an activator of mammalian dynein motility. Here we use single-molecule imaging and optical trapping to show that Lis1 does not directly alter the stepping and force production of individual dynein motors assembled with dynactin and a cargo adaptor. Instead, Lis1 promotes the formation of an active complex with dynactin. Lis1 also favours the recruitment of two dyneins to dynactin, resulting in increased velocity, higher force production and more effective competition against kinesin in a tug-of-war. Lis1 dissociates from motile complexes, indicating that its primary role is to orchestrate the assembly of the transport machinery. We propose that Lis1 binding releases dynein from its autoinhibited state, which provides a mechanistic explanation for why Lis1 is required for efficient transport of many dynein-associated cargos in cells."	0

Despite the importance of such metabolic reprogramming, it remains unclear how development and metabolism are integrated. Here, we show that disruption of ANGUSTIFOLIA3 orthologs (PpAN3s) compromises gametophore shoot formation in the moss Physcomitrium patens due to defective cell proliferation and expansion. Trans-omics analysis reveals that the downstream activity of PpAN3 is linked to arginine metabolism. Elevating arginine level by chemical treatment leads to stunted gametophores and causes Ppan3 mutant-like transcriptional changes in the wild-type plant. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtAN3 from Arabidopsis thaliana ameliorates the defective arginine metabolism and promotes gametophore formation in Ppan3 mutants. Together, these findings indicate that arginine metabolism is a key pathway associated with gametophore formation and provide evolutionary insights into the establishment of the shoot system in land plants through the integration of developmental and metabolic processes."	0
"32294448"	"Thermodynamic and Evolutionary Coupling between the Native and Amyloid State of Globular Proteins.The amyloid-like aggregation propensity present in most globular proteins is generally considered to be a secondary side effect resulting from the requirements of protein stability.

In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations. We speculate that, rather than being a corollary of protein evolution, it is equally plausible that positive selection for amyloid structure could have been a driver for the emergence of globular protein structure."	0
"32375028"	"Representative Sequencing: Unbiased Sampling of Solid Tumor Tissue.Although thousands of solid tumors have been sequenced to date, a fundamental under-sampling bias is inherent in current methodologies. This is caused by a tissue sample input of fixed dimensions (e.g., 6 mm biopsy), which becomes grossly under-powered as tumor volume scales. Here, we demonstrate representative sequencing (Rep-Seq) as a new method to achieve unbiased tumor tissue sampling. Rep-Seq uses fixed residual tumor material, which is homogenized and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Analysis of intratumor tumor mutation burden (TMB) variability shows a high level of misclassification using current single-biopsy methods, with 20% of lung and 52% of bladder tumors having at least one biopsy with high TMB but low clonal TMB overall. Misclassification rates by contrast are reduced to 2% (lung) and 4% (bladder) when a more representative sampling methodology is used.

To determine the composition of fragile particles, we introduce CUT&RUN.ChIP, in which targeted nuclease cleavage and release is followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that fragile particles represent the occupancy of the RSC (remodeling the structure of chromatin) nucleosome remodeling complex and RSC-bound, partially unwrapped nucleosomal intermediates. We also find that general regulatory factors (GRFs) bind to partially unwrapped nucleosomes at these promoters. We propose that RSC binding and its action cause nucleosomes to unravel, facilitate subsequent binding of GRFs, and constitute a dynamic cycle of nucleosome deposition and clearance at the subset of wide Pol II promoter NDRs."	0

We report an interaction between LRRK2 and VPS52, a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that identifies a function of LRRK2 in regulating membrane fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, LRRK2 further interacts with the Golgi SNAREs VAMP4 and Syntaxin-6 and acts as a scaffolding platform that stabilizes the GARP-SNAREs complex formation. Therefore, LRRK2 influences both retrograde and post-Golgi trafficking pathways in a manner dependent on its GTP binding and kinase activity.

"32726630"	"Neutrophil Caspase-11 Is Essential to Defend against a Cytosol-Invasive Bacterium.Either caspase-1 or caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D to cause pyroptosis, eliminating intracellular replication niches. We previously showed that macrophages detect Burkholderia thailandensis via NLRC4, triggering the release of interleukin (IL)-18 and driving an essential interferon (IFN)-γ response that primes caspase-11. We now identify the IFN-γ-producing cells as a mixture of natural killer (NK) and T cells. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D in macrophages and neutrophils, we find that NLRC4-activated caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis in macrophages, but this pathway does not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils. In contrast, caspase-11 triggers pyroptosis in both macrophages and neutrophils. This translates to an absolute requirement for caspase-11 in neutrophils during B. thailandensis infection in mice. We present an example of inflammasome sensors causing diverging outcomes in different cell types. Thus, cell fates are dictated not simply by the pathogen or inflammasome, but also by how the cell is wired to respond to detection events."	0

Previously, we obtained a mutant of <i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i> HH103, <i>rkpA</i>, that does not produce KPS, a homopolysaccharide of a pseudaminic acid derivative, but whose LPS electrophoretic profile was indistinguishable from that of the WT strain. We also previously demonstrated that the HH103 <i>rkpLMNOPQ</i> operon is responsible for 5-acetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-7-(3-hydroxybutyramido)-l-<i>glycero</i>-l-<i>manno</i>-nonulosonic acid [Pse5NAc7(3OHBu)] production and is involved in HH103 KPS and LPS biosynthesis and that an HH103 <i>rkpM</i> mutant cannot produce KPS and displays an altered LPS structure. Here, we analyzed the LPS structure of HH103 <i>rkpA</i>, focusing on the carbohydrate portion, and found that it contains a highly heterogeneous lipid A and a peculiar core oligosaccharide composed of an unusually high number of hexuronic acids containing β-configured Pse5NAc7(3OHBu). This pseudaminic acid derivative, in its α-configuration, was the only structural component of the <i>S. fredii</i> HH103 KPS and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported from any other rhizobial LPS. We also show that Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) is the complete or partial epitope for a mAb, NB6-228.22, that can recognize the HH103 LPS, but not those of most of the <i>S. fredii</i> strains tested here. We also show that the LPS from HH103 <i>rkpM</i> is identical to that of HH103 <i>rkpA</i> but devoid of any Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) residues. Notably, this <i>rkpM</i> mutant was severely impaired in symbiosis with its host, <i>Macroptilium atropurpureum</i>."	0

While the small GTPase Rheb1 is the canonical activator of mTORC1, Rheb1-independent mechanisms of mTORC1 activation have also been reported but have not been fully understood. Employing multiple transgenic mouse models of breast cancer, we report that ablation of Rheb1 significantly impedes mammary tumorigenesis. In the absence of Rheb1, a block in tumor initiation can be overcome by multiple independent mutations in Mtor to allow Rheb1-independent reactivation of mTORC1. We further demonstrate that the mTOR kinase is indispensable for tumor initiation as the genetic ablation of mTOR abolishes mammary tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 activation is indispensable for mammary tumor initiation and that tumors acquire alternative mechanisms of mTORC1 activation."	0

Results from previous studies support that CD40 protein expression is elevated in Müller glia of diabetic mice; however, the mechanisms responsible for this increase have not been explored. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that diabetes augments translation of the <i>Cd40</i> mRNA. Mice receiving thiamet G (TMG), an inhibitor of the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc hydrolase <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase, exhibited enhanced retinal protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation and increased <i>Cd40</i> mRNA translation. TMG administration also promoted <i>Cd40</i> mRNA association with Müller cell-specific ribosomes isolated from the retina of RiboTag mice. Similar effects on <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation and <i>Cd40</i> mRNA translation were also observed in the retina of a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. In cultured cells, TMG promoted sequestration of the cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic translation in initiation factor 4E) by 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1) and enhanced cap-independent <i>Cd40</i> mRNA translation as assessed by a bicistronic reporter that contained the 5'-UTR of the <i>Cd40</i> mRNA. Ablation of 4E-BP1/2 prevented the increase in <i>Cd40</i> mRNA translation in TMG-exposed cells, and expression of a 4E-BP1 variant that constitutively sequesters eIF4E promoted reporter activity. Extending on the cell culture results, we found that in contrast to WT mice, diabetic 4E-BP1/2-deficient mice did not exhibit enhanced retinal <i>Cd40</i> mRNA translation and failed to up-regulate expression of the inflammatory marker nitric-oxide synthase 2. These findings support a model wherein diabetes-induced <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 promotes <i>Cd40</i> mRNA translation in Müller glia."	0
"32454028"	"Antibody RING-Mediated Destruction of Endogenous Proteins.To understand gene function, the encoding DNA or mRNA transcript can be manipulated and the consequences observed. However, these approaches do not have a direct effect on the protein product of the gene, which is either permanently abrogated or depleted at a rate defined by the half-life of the protein. We therefore developed a single-component system that could induce the rapid degradation of the specific endogenous protein itself. A construct combining the RING domain of ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 with a protein-specific camelid nanobody mediates target destruction by the ubiquitin proteasome system, a process we describe as antibody RING-mediated destruction (ARMeD). The technique is highly specific because we observed no off-target protein destruction. Furthermore, bacterially produced nanobody-RING fusion proteins electroporated into cells induce degradation of target within minutes. With increasing availability of protein-specific nanobodies, this method will allow rapid and specific degradation of a wide range of endogenous proteins."	0
"31253574"	"Structural Basis of BRCC36 Function in DNA Repair and Immune Regulation.In mammals, ∼100 deubiquitinases act on ∼20,000 intracellular ubiquitination sites. Deubiquitinases are commonly regarded as constitutively active, with limited regulatory and targeting capacity. The BRCA1-A and BRISC complexes serve in DNA double-strand break repair and immune signaling and contain the lysine-63 linkage-specific BRCC36 subunit that is functionalized by scaffold subunits ABRAXAS and ABRO1, respectively. The molecular basis underlying BRCA1-A and BRISC function is currently unknown. Here we show that in the BRCA1-A complex structure, ABRAXAS integrates the DNA repair protein RAP80 and provides a high-affinity binding site that sequesters the tumor suppressor BRCA1 away from the break site. In the BRISC structure, ABRO1 binds SHMT2α, a metabolic enzyme enabling cancer growth in hypoxic environments, which we find prevents BRCC36 from binding and cleaving ubiquitin chains. Our work explains modularity in the BRCC36 DUB family, with different adaptor subunits conferring diversified targeting and regulatory functions."	0

To identify key dependencies of AML stem cells in vivo, here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen targeting cell surface genes in a syngeneic MLL-AF9 AML mouse model and show that CXCR4 is a top cell surface regulator of AML cell growth and survival. Deletion of Cxcr4 in AML cells eradicates leukemia cells in vivo without impairing their homing to the bone marrow. In contrast, the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 is dispensable for leukemia development in recipient mice. Moreover, expression of mutated Cxcr4 variants reveals that CXCR4 signaling is essential for leukemia cells. Notably, loss of CXCR4 signaling in leukemia cells leads to oxidative stress and differentiation in vivo. Taken together, our results identify CXCR4 signaling as essential for AML stem cells by protecting them from differentiation independent of CXCL12 stimulation."	0

"31353207"	"C1QBP Promotes Homologous Recombination by Stabilizing MRE11 and Controlling the Assembly and Activation of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 Complex.MRE11 nuclease forms a trimeric complex (MRN) with RAD50 and NBS1 and plays a central role in preventing genomic instability. When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MRN is quickly recruited to the damage site and initiates DNA end resection; accordingly, MRE11 must be tightly regulated to avoid inefficient repair or nonspecific resection. Here, we show that MRE11 and RAD50 form a complex (MRC) with C1QBP, which stabilizes MRE11/RAD50, while inhibiting MRE11 nuclease activity by preventing its binding to DNA or chromatin. Upon DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates MRE11-S676/S678 to quickly dissociate the MRC complex. Either excess or insufficient C1QBP impedes the recruitment of MRE11 to DSBs and impairs the DNA damage response. C1QBP is highly expressed in breast cancer and positively correlates with MRE11 expression, and the inhibition of C1QBP enhances tumor regression with chemotherapy. By influencing MRE11 at multiple levels, C1QBP is, thus, an important player in the DNA damage response."	0
"32521264"	"PRMT1-p53 Pathway Controls Epicardial EMT and Invasion.Epicardial cells are cardiac progenitors that give rise to the majority of cardiac fibroblasts, coronary smooth muscle cells, and pericytes during development. An integral phase of epicardial fate transition is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that confers motility. We uncover an essential role for the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in epicardial invasion and differentiation. Using scRNA-seq, we show that epicardial-specific deletion of Prmt1 reduced matrix and ribosomal gene expression in epicardial-derived cell lineages. PRMT1 regulates splicing of Mdm4, which is a key controller of p53 stability. Loss of PRMT1 leads to accumulation of p53 that enhances Slug degradation and blocks EMT. During heart development, the PRMT1-p53 pathway is required for epicardial invasion and formation of epicardial-derived lineages: cardiac fibroblasts, coronary smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. Consequently, this pathway modulates ventricular morphogenesis and coronary vessel formation. Altogether, our study reveals molecular mechanisms involving the PRMT1-p53 pathway and establish its roles in heart development."	1
"32111741"	"The Parkinson's disease-associated kinase LRRK2 regulates genes required for cell adhesion, polarization, and chemotaxis in activated murine macrophages.Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) encodes a complex protein that includes kinase and GTPase domains. Genome-wide association studies have identified dominant <i>LRRK2</i> alleles that predispose their carriers to late-onset idiotypic Parkinson's disease (PD) and also to autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease. Considerable evidence indicates that PD initiation and progression involve activation of innate immune functions in microglia, which are brain-resident macrophages. Here we asked whether LRRK2 modifies inflammatory signaling and how this modification might contribute to PD and Crohn's disease. We used RNA-Seq-based high-resolution transcriptomics to compare gene expression in activated primary macrophages derived from WT and <i>Lrrk2</i> knockout mice. Remarkably, expression of a single gene, Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (<i>Rapgef3</i>), was strongly up-regulated in the absence of LRRK2 and down-regulated in its presence. We observed similar regulation of <i>Rapgef3</i> expression in cells treated with a highly specific inhibitor of LRRK2 protein kinase activity. <i>Rapgef3</i> encodes an exchange protein, activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC-1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the small GTPase Rap-1. Rap-1 mediates cell adhesion, polarization, and directional motility, and our results indicate that LRRK2 modulates chemotaxis of microglia and macrophages. Dominant PD-associated <i>LRRK2</i> alleles may suppress EPAC-1 activity, further restricting motility and preventing efficient migration of microglia to sites of neuronal damage. Functional analysis <i>in vivo</i> in a subclinical infection model also indicated that Lrrk2 subtly modifies the inflammatory response. These results indicate that LRRK2 modulates the expression of genes involved in murine immune cell chemotaxis."	1
"32330456"	"Absolute Quantification of Transcription Factors Reveals Principles of Gene Regulation in Erythropoiesis.Dynamic cellular processes such as differentiation are driven by changes in the abundances of transcription factors (TFs). However, despite years of studies, our knowledge about the protein copy number of TFs in the nucleus is limited. Here, by determining the absolute abundances of 103 TFs and co-factors during the course of human erythropoiesis, we provide a dynamic and quantitative scale for TFs in the nucleus. Furthermore, we establish the first gene regulatory network of cell fate commitment that integrates temporal protein stoichiometry data with mRNA measurements. The model revealed quantitative imbalances in TFs' cross-antagonistic relationships that underlie lineage determination. Finally, we made the surprising discovery that, in the nucleus, co-repressors are dramatically more abundant than co-activators at the protein level, but not at the RNA level, with profound implications for understanding transcriptional regulation. These analyses provide a unique quantitative framework to understand transcriptional regulation of cell differentiation in a dynamic context."	0

Several URT-specific isolates are cultured, characterized, and further explored for their genetic and functional properties related to adaptation to the URT. Catalase genes are found in the identified lactobacilli, which is a unique feature within this mostly facultative anaerobic genus. Moreover, one of our isolated strains, Lactobacillus casei AMBR2, contains fimbriae that enable strong adherence to URT epithelium, inhibit the growth and virulence of several URT pathogens, and successfully colonize nasal epithelium of healthy volunteers. This study thus demonstrates that specific lactobacilli are adapted to the URT and could have a beneficial keystone function in this habitat."	0

Cch1 is homologous to the pore-forming α<sub>1</sub> subunit of animal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and sodium leak channels nonselective (NALCNs), whereas Mid1 is a membrane-associated protein similar to the regulatory α<sub>2</sub>/δ subunit of VGCCs and the regulatory subunit of NALCNs.

Herein, we identify amino acid residues involved in interactions between the pore-forming Cch1 subunit and the essential regulatory Mid1 subunit of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i><i>In vitro</i> mutagenesis followed by functional assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that three residues present in a specific extracellular loop in the repeat III region of Cch1 are required for interaction with Mid1, and that one essential Mid1 residue is required for interaction with Cch1. Importantly, these residues are necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity and are highly conserved in fungal and animal counterparts.

"31229405"	"Rearrangements within the U6 snRNA Core during the Transition between the Two Catalytic Steps of Splicing.The RNA catalytic core of spliceosomes as visualized by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) remains unchanged at different stages of splicing. However, we demonstrate that mutations within the core of yeast U6 snRNA modulate conformational changes between the two catalytic steps. We propose that the intramolecular stem-loop (ISL) of U6 exists in two competing states, changing between a default, non-catalytic conformation and a transient, catalytic conformation. Whereas stable interactions in the catalytic triplex promote catalysis and their disruptions favor exit from the catalytic conformation, destabilization of the lower ISL stem promotes catalysis and its stabilization supports exit from the catalytic conformation. Thus, in addition to the catalytic triplex, U6-ISL acts as an important dynamic component of the catalytic center. The relative flexibility of the lower U6-ISL stem is conserved across eukaryotes. Similar features are found in U6atac and domain V of group II introns, arguing for the generality of the proposed mechanism."	0

This reaction is performed by a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent epimerase belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. We present several high-resolution crystal structures of the UDP-glucuronic acid epimerase from <i>Bacillus cereus</i> The geometry of the substrate-NAD<sup>+</sup> interactions is finely arranged to promote hydride transfer. The exquisite complementarity between glucuronic acid and its binding site is highlighted by the observation that the unligated cavity is occupied by a cluster of ordered waters whose positions overlap the polar groups of the sugar substrate. Co-crystallization experiments led to a structure where substrate- and product-bound enzymes coexist within the same crystal. This equilibrium structure reveals the basis for a ""swing and flip"" rotation of the pro-chiral 4-keto-hexose-uronic acid intermediate that results from glucuronic acid oxidation, placing the C4' atom in position for receiving a hydride ion on the opposite side of the sugar ring. The product-bound active site is almost identical to that of the substrate-bound structure and satisfies all hydrogen-bonding requirements of the ligand. The structure of the apoenzyme together with the kinetic isotope effect and mutagenesis experiments further outlines a few flexible loops that exist in discrete conformations, imparting structural malleability required for ligand rotation while avoiding leakage of the catalytic intermediate and/or side reactions. These data highlight the double nature of the enzymatic mechanism: the active site features a high degree of precision in substrate recognition combined with the flexibility required for intermediate rotation."	0
"32554464"	"Extended subsite profiling of the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D reveals a region recognized by inflammatory caspase-11.Pyroptosis is the caspase-dependent inflammatory cell death mechanism that underpins the innate immune response against pathogens and is dysregulated in inflammatory disorders. Pyroptosis occurs via two pathways: the canonical pathway, signaled by caspase-1, and the noncanonical pathway, regulated by mouse caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5. All inflammatory caspases activate the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D, but caspase-1 mostly activates the inflammatory cytokine precursors prointerleukin-18 and prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL18/pro-IL1β). Here, <i>in vitro</i> cleavage assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that caspase-11 prefers cleaving gasdermin D over the pro-ILs. However, we found that caspase-11 recognizes protein substrates through a mechanism that is different from that of most caspases. Results of kinetics analysis with synthetic fluorogenic peptides indicated that P1'-P4', the C-terminal gasdermin D region adjacent to the cleavage site, influences gasdermin D recognition by caspase-11. Furthermore, introducing the gasdermin D P1'-P4' region into pro-IL18 enhanced catalysis by caspase-11 to levels comparable with that of gasdermin D cleavage. Pro-IL1β cleavage was only moderately enhanced by similar substitutions. We conclude that caspase-11 specificity is mediated by the P1'-P4' region in its substrate gasdermin D, and similar experiments confirmed that the substrate specificities of the human orthologs of caspase-11, <i>i.e.</i> caspase-4 and caspase-5, are ruled by the same mechanism. We propose that P1'-P4'-based inhibitors could be exploited to specifically target inflammatory caspases."	0

To identify factors that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin, we affinity-selected solubilized fission yeast CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin. All subunits of the Ino80 complex were enriched, including the auxiliary subunit Hap2. Chromatin association of Hap2 is Ies4-dependent. In addition to a role in maintenance of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin integrity at endogenous centromeres, Hap2 is required for de novo assembly of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin on naïve centromere DNA and promotes H3 turnover on centromere regions and other loci prone to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> deposition. Prior to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin assembly, Hap2 facilitates transcription from centromere DNA. These analyses suggest that Hap2-Ino80 destabilizes H3 nucleosomes on centromere DNA through transcription-coupled histone H3 turnover, driving the replacement of resident H3 nucleosomes with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes. These inherent properties define centromere DNA by directing a program that mediates CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> assembly on appropriate sequences."	0

However, only a subset of patients achieves durable responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of the immune checkpoint pathways are not completely understood. Here, we report that PD-L1 translocates from the plasma membrane into the nucleus through interactions with components of the endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, regulated by p300-mediated acetylation and HDAC2-dependent deacetylation of PD-L1. Moreover, PD-L1 deficiency leads to compromised expression of multiple immune-response-related genes. Genetically or pharmacologically modulating PD-L1 acetylation blocks its nuclear translocation, reprograms the expression of immune-response-related genes and, as a consequence, enhances the anti-tumour response to PD-1 blockade. Thus, our results reveal an acetylation-dependent regulation of PD-L1 nuclear localization that governs immune-response gene expression, and thereby advocate targeting PD-L1 translocation to enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade."	1

The molecular mechanisms that link these pathways, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that the <i>Drosophila</i> estrogen-related receptor (<i>dERR</i>) directs a transcriptional switch in mid-pupae that promotes glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in young adults. <i>dERR</i> mutant adults are viable but display reduced locomotor activity, susceptibility to starvation, elevated glucose, and an almost complete lack of stored triglycerides. Molecular profiling by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and metabolomics revealed that glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway genes are induced by dERR, and their reduced expression in mutants is accompanied by elevated glycolytic intermediates, reduced TCA cycle intermediates, and reduced levels of long chain fatty acids. Unexpectedly, we found that the central pathways of energy metabolism, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain, are coordinately induced at the transcriptional level in mid-pupae and maintained into adulthood, and this response is partially dependent on <i>dERR</i>, leading to the metabolic defects observed in mutants. Our data support the model that <i>dERR</i> contributes to a transcriptional switch during pupal development that establishes the metabolic state of the adult fly."	0

ORC (origin recognition complex) binds to and marks replication origins throughout the cell cycle and loads other replication-initiation proteins onto replication origins to form pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs), completing replication licensing. However, how an asymmetric single-heterohexameric ORC structure loads the symmetric MCM (minichromosome maintenance) double hexamers is controversial, and importantly, it remains unknown when and how ORC proteins associate with the newly replicated origins to protect them from invasion by histones. Here, we report an essential and cell-cycle-dependent ORC ""dimerization cycle"" that plays three fundamental roles in the regulation of DNA replication: providing a symmetric platform to load the symmetric pre-RCs, marking and protecting the nascent sister replication origins for the next licensing, and playing a crucial role to prevent origin re-licensing within the same cell cycle."	0

We investigated the specificity and molecular mechanism of this regulation, demonstrating that Cas9 controls a highly specific regulon of four genes that must be repressed for bacterial virulence. Regulation occurs through a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent interaction of Cas9 with its endogenous DNA targets, dependent on a non-canonical small RNA (scaRNA) and tracrRNA. The limited complementarity between scaRNA and the endogenous DNA targets precludes cleavage, highlighting the evolution of scaRNA to repress transcription without lethally targeting the chromosome. We show that scaRNA can be reprogrammed to repress other genes, and with engineered, extended complementarity to an exogenous target, the repurposed scaRNA:tracrRNA-FnoCas9 machinery can also direct DNA cleavage. Natural Cas9 transcriptional interference likely represents a broad paradigm of regulatory functionality, which is potentially critical to the physiology of numerous Cas9-encoding pathogenic and commensal organisms."	0

While the cocaine-mediated increase in DA signaling on MSNs is well documented, that on cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) has been more difficult to assess.

To examine the functional substitutability of Otx2 and Crx, we generate knockin mouse lines in which Crx is replaced by Otx2 and vice versa. We find that Otx2 and Crx cannot be substituted in photoreceptor development. Subsequently, we investigate the function of Otx2 in photoreceptor and bipolar cell development. High Otx2 levels induce photoreceptor cell fate but not bipolar cell fate, whereas reduced Otx2 expression impairs bipolar cell maturation and survival. Furthermore, we identify Otx2 and Crx in the lamprey genome by using synteny analysis, suggesting that the last common ancestor of vertebrates possesses both Otx2 and Crx.

Our selective differentiation protocols should contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying human kidney development and disease and also supply cell sources for regenerative therapies."	0
"31995768"	"Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Humoral Immunity Reveals Continued and Personalized Evolution in Chronic Viral Infection.Control of established chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection requires the production of neutralizing antibodies, but it remains unknown how the ensemble of antibodies evolves during ongoing infection. Here, we analyze the evolution of antibody responses during acute or chronic LCMV infection, combining quantitative functional assays and time-resolved antibody repertoire sequencing. We establish that antibody responses initially converge in both infection types on a functional and repertoire level, but diverge later during chronic infection, showing increased clonal diversity, the appearance of mouse-specific persistent clones, and distinct phylogenetic signatures. Chronic infection is characterized by a longer-lasting germinal center reaction and a continuous differentiation of plasma cells, resulting in the emergence of higher-affinity plasma cells exhibiting increased antibody secretion rates. Taken together, our findings reveal the emergence of a personalized antibody response in chronic infection and support the concept that maintaining B cell diversity throughout chronic LCMV infection correlates with the development of infection-resolving antibodies."	0

"32268092"	"Super Elongation Complex as a Targetable Dependency in Diffuse Midline Glioma.Histone 3 gene mutations are the eponymous drivers in diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), aggressive pediatric brain cancers for which no curative therapy currently exists. These recurrent oncohistones induce a global loss of repressive H3K27me3 residues and broad epigenetic dysregulation. In order to identify therapeutically targetable dependencies within this disease context, we performed an RNAi screen targeting epigenetic/chromatin-associated genes in patient-derived DMG cultures. This identified AFF4, the scaffold protein of the super elongation complex (SEC), as a molecular dependency in DMG. Interrogation of SEC function demonstrates a key role for maintaining clonogenic potential while promoting self-renewal of tumor stem cells. Small-molecule inhibition of SEC using clinically relevant CDK9 inhibitors restores regulatory RNA polymerase II pausing, promotes cellular differentiation, and leads to potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. These studies present a rationale for further exploration of SEC inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach to this intractable disease."	0

"32905767"	"Cholinergic Synaptic Homeostasis Is Tuned by an NFAT-Mediated α7 nAChR-K<sub>v</sub>4/Shal Coupled Regulatory System.Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) involves compensatory mechanisms employed by neurons and circuits to preserve signaling when confronted with global changes in activity that may occur during physiological and pathological conditions. Cholinergic neurons, which are especially affected in some pathologies, have recently been shown to exhibit HSP mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In Drosophila central neurons, pharmacological blockade of activity induces a homeostatic response mediated by the Drosophila α7 (Dα7) nAChR, which is tuned by a subsequent increase in expression of the voltage-dependent K<sub>v</sub>4/Shal channel. Here, we show that an in vivo reduction of cholinergic signaling induces HSP mediated by Dα7 nAChRs, and this upregulation of Dα7 itself is sufficient to trigger transcriptional activation, mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), of the K<sub>v</sub>4/Shal gene, revealing a receptor-ion channel system coupled for homeostatic tuning in cholinergic neurons."	0
"32610138"	"Structure of Human ATG9A, the Only Transmembrane Protein of the Core Autophagy Machinery.Autophagy is a catabolic process involving capture of cytoplasmic materials into double-membraned autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation of the materials by lysosomal hydrolases. One of the least understood components of the autophagy machinery is the transmembrane protein ATG9. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the function of ATG9A. In addition, structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes."	0
"31954095"	"Candidate Cancer Driver Mutations in Distal Regulatory Elements and Long-Range Chromatin Interaction Networks.A comprehensive catalog of cancer driver mutations is essential for understanding tumorigenesis and developing therapies. Exome-sequencing studies have mapped many protein-coding drivers, yet few non-coding drivers are known because genome-wide discovery is challenging. We developed a driver discovery method, ActiveDriverWGS, and analyzed 120,788 cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 1,844 whole tumor genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. We found 30 CRMs with enriched SNVs and indels (FDR < 0.05). These frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) were ubiquitously active in human tissues, showed long-range chromatin interactions and mRNA abundance associations with target genes, and were enriched in motif-rewiring mutations and structural variants. Genomic deletion of one FMRE in human cells caused proliferative deficiencies and transcriptional deregulation of cancer genes CCNB1IP1, CDH1, and CDKN2B, validating observations in FMRE-mutated tumors. Pathway analysis revealed further sub-significant FMREs at cancer genes and processes, indicating an unexplored landscape of infrequent driver mutations in the non-coding genome."	0
"32668254"	"Antagonistic Activities of Vegfr3/Flt4 and Notch1b Fine-tune Mechanosensitive Signaling during Zebrafish Cardiac Valvulogenesis.The formation of cardiac valves depends on mechanical forces exerted by blood flow. Endocardial cells lining the interior of the heart are sensitive to these stimuli and respond by rearranging into luminal cells subjected to shear stress and abluminal cells not exposed to it. The mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense these dynamic biomechanical stimuli and how they evoke different cellular responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that blood flow activates two parallel mechanosensitive pathways, one mediated by Notch and the other by Klf2a. Both pathways negatively regulate the angiogenesis receptor Vegfr3/Flt4, which becomes restricted to abluminal endocardial cells. Its loss disrupts valve morphogenesis and results in the occurrence of Notch signaling within abluminal endocardial cells. Our work explains how antagonistic activities by Vegfr3/Flt4 on the abluminal side and by Notch on the luminal side shape cardiac valve leaflets by triggering unique differences in the fates of endocardial cells."	1
"32187560"	"Defining Epidermal Basal Cell States during Skin Homeostasis and Wound Healing Using Single-Cell Transcriptomics.Our knowledge of transcriptional heterogeneities in epithelial stem and progenitor cell compartments is limited. Epidermal basal cells sustain cutaneous tissue maintenance and drive wound healing. Previous studies have probed basal cell heterogeneity in stem and progenitor potential, but a comprehensive dissection of basal cell dynamics during differentiation is lacking. Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell state in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. Pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analyses predict a quasi-linear differentiation hierarchy where basal cells progress from Col17a1<sup>Hi</sup>/Trp63<sup>Hi</sup> state to early-response state, proliferate at the juncture of these two states, or become growth arrested before differentiating into spinous cells. Wound healing induces plasticity manifested by dynamic basal-spinous interconversions at multiple basal transcriptional states.

"32580943"	"In-cell infrared difference spectroscopy of LOV photoreceptors reveals structural responses to light altered in living cells.Proteins are usually studied in well-defined buffer conditions, which differ substantially from those within a host cell. In some cases, the intracellular environment has an impact on the mechanism, which might be missed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments. IR difference spectroscopy previously has been applied to study the light-induced response of photoreceptors and photoenzymes <i>in vitro</i> Here, we established the in-cell IR difference (ICIRD) spectroscopy in the transmission and attenuated total reflection configuration to investigate the light-induced response of soluble proteins in living bacterial cells. ICIRD spectroscopy on the light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains of the blue light receptors aureochrome and phototropin revealed a suppression of the response of specific secondary structure elements, indicating that the intracellular environment affects LOV photoreceptor mechanisms in general. Moreover, in-cell fluorescence spectroscopy disclosed that the intracellular environment slows down the recovery of the light-induced flavin adduct. Segment-resolved ICIRD spectroscopy on basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP)-LOV of aureochrome 1a from the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> indicated a signal progression from the LOV sensor to the bZIP effector independent of unfolding of the connecting A'α-helix, an observation that stood in contrast to <i>in vitro</i> results. This deviation was recapitulated <i>in vitro</i> by emulating the intracellular environment through the addition of the crowding agent BSA, but not by sucrose polymers. We conclude that ICIRD spectroscopy is a noninvasive, label-free approach for assessing conformational changes in receptors in living cells at ambient conditions. As demonstrated, these near-native responses may deviate from the mechanisms established under <i>in vitro</i> conditions."	0
"32877681"	"Characterization of Resident Corneal Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells and Their Pivotal Role in Herpes Simplex Keratitis.The presence and potential functions of resident plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in peripheral tissues is unclear. We report that pDCs constitutively populate naïve corneas and are increased during sterile injuries or acute herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) keratitis. Their local depletion leads to severe clinical disease, nerve loss, viral dissemination to the trigeminal ganglion and draining lymph nodes, and mortality, while their local adoptive transfer limits disease. pDCs are the main source of HSV-1-induced IFN-α in the corneal stroma through TLR9, and they prevent re-programming of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector ex-Tregs. Clinical signs of infection are observed in pDC-depleted corneas, but not in pDC-sufficient corneas, following low-dose HSV-1 inoculation, suggesting their critical role in corneal antiviral immunity. Our findings demonstrate a vital role for corneal pDCs in the control of local viral infections."	0
"32579927"	"Drug GRADE: An Integrated Analysis of Population Growth and Cell Death Reveals Drug-Specific and Cancer Subtype-Specific Response Profiles.When evaluating anti-cancer drugs, two different measurements are used: relative viability, which scores an amalgam of proliferative arrest and cell death, and fractional viability, which specifically scores the degree of cell killing. We quantify relationships between drug-induced growth inhibition and cell death by counting live and dead cells using quantitative microscopy. We find that most drugs affect both proliferation and death, but in different proportions and with different relative timing. This causes a non-uniform relationship between relative and fractional response measurements. To unify these measurements, we created a data visualization and analysis platform called drug GRADE, which characterizes the degree to which death contributes to an observed drug response. GRADE captures drug- and genotype-specific responses, which are not captured using traditional pharmacometrics. This study highlights the idiosyncratic nature of drug-induced proliferative arrest and cell death. Furthermore, we provide a metric for quantitatively evaluating the relationship between these behaviors."	0
"32698000"	"Cohesin-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms Mediate Chromosomal Contacts between Promoters and Enhancers.It is currently assumed that 3D chromosomal organization plays a central role in transcriptional control. However, depletion of cohesin and CTCF affects the steady-state levels of only a minority of transcripts. Here, we use high-resolution Capture Hi-C to interrogate the dynamics of chromosomal contacts of all annotated human gene promoters upon degradation of cohesin and CTCF. We show that a majority of promoter-anchored contacts are lost in these conditions, but many contacts with distinct properties are maintained, and some new ones are gained. The rewiring of contacts between promoters and active enhancers upon cohesin degradation associates with rapid changes in target gene transcription as detected by SLAM sequencing (SLAM-seq). These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited, but consistent, effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on steady-state transcription and suggest the existence of both cohesin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of enhancer-promoter pairing."	0
"32675285"	"Intracellular autoactivation of TMPRSS11A, an airway epithelial transmembrane serine protease.Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) are a group of enzymes participating in diverse biological processes. Some members of the TTSP family are implicated in viral infection. TMPRSS11A is a TTSP expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells, which has been shown to cleave and activate spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A that converts the one-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme. By expression in human embryonic kidney 293, esophageal EC9706, and lung epithelial A549 and 16HBE cells, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the activation cleavage of human TMPRSS11A was mediated by autocatalysis. Moreover, we found that TMPRSS11A activation cleavage occurred before the protein reached the cell surface, as indicated by studies with trypsin digestion to remove cell surface proteins, treatment with cell organelle-disturbing agents to block intracellular protein trafficking, and analysis of a soluble form of TMPRSS11A without the transmembrane domain. We also showed that TMPRSS11A was able to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results reveal an intracellular autocleavage mechanism in TMPRSS11A zymogen activation, which differs from the extracellular zymogen activation reported in other TTSPs. These findings provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms in regulating TTSP activation."	0
"32631952"	"Disruption of insulin receptor substrate-2 impairs growth but not insulin function in rats.Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2, along with IRS-1, is a key signaling molecule that mediates the action of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. The activated insulin and IGF-I receptors phosphorylate IRSs on tyrosine residues, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways and the induction of various physiological functions of insulin and IGF-I. Studies using IRS-2 knockout (KO) mice showed that the deletion of IRS-2 causes type 2 diabetes due to peripheral insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. However, little is known about the roles of IRS-2 in other animal models. Here, we created IRS-2 KO rats to elucidate the physiological functions of IRS-2 in rats. The body weights of IRS-2 KO rats at birth were lower compared with those of their WT littermates. The postnatal growth of both male and female IRS-2 KO rats was also suppressed. Compared with male WT rats, the glucose and insulin tolerance of male IRS-2 KO rats were slightly enhanced, whereas a similar difference was not observed between female WT and IRS-2 KO rats. Besides the modestly increased insulin sensitivity, male IRS-2 KO rats displayed the enhanced insulin-induced activation of the mTOR complex 1 pathway in the liver compared with WT rats. Taken together, these results indicate that in rats, IRS-2 plays important roles in the regulation of growth but is not essential for the glucose-lowering effects of insulin."	0

"31914385"	"Hypothalamic Contribution to Pituitary Functions Is Recapitulated In Vitro Using 3D-Cultured Human iPS Cells.The pituitary is a major hormone center that secretes systemic hormones responding to hypothalamus-derived-releasing hormones. Previously, we reported the independent pituitary induction and hypothalamic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, a functional hypothalamic-pituitary unit is generated using human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in vitro. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion capacity of the induced pituitary reached a comparable level to that of adult mouse pituitary because of the simultaneous maturation with hypothalamic neurons within the same aggregates. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamic area regulates ACTH cells similarly to our hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Our induced hypothalamic-pituitary units respond to environmental hypoglycemic condition in vitro, which mimics a life-threatening situation in vivo, through the CRH-ACTH pathway, and succeed in increasing ACTH secretion. Thus, we generated powerful hybrid organoids by recapitulating hypothalamic-pituitary development, showing autonomous maturation on the basis of interactions between developing tissues."	0
"31902669"	"The Dynamics of Cytoplasmic mRNA Metabolism.For all but a few mRNAs, the dynamics of metabolism are unknown. Here, we developed an experimental and analytical framework for examining these dynamics for mRNAs from thousands of genes. mRNAs of mouse fibroblasts exit the nucleus with diverse intragenic and intergenic poly(A)-tail lengths. Once in the cytoplasm, they have a broad (1000-fold) range of deadenylation rate constants, which correspond to cytoplasmic lifetimes. Indeed, with few exceptions, degradation appears to occur primarily through deadenylation-linked mechanisms, with little contribution from either endonucleolytic cleavage or deadenylation-independent decapping. Most mRNA molecules degrade only after their tail lengths fall below 25 nt. Decay rate constants of short-tailed mRNAs vary broadly (1000-fold) and are larger for short-tailed mRNAs that have previously undergone more rapid deadenylation. This coupling helps clear rapidly deadenylated mRNAs, enabling the large range in deadenylation rate constants to impart a similarly large range in stabilities."	0
"30639244"	"RNA Polymerase II CTD Tyrosine 1 Is Required for Efficient Termination by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 Pathway.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcription termination at protein-coding genes is coupled to the cleavage of the nascent transcript, whereas most non-coding RNA transcription relies on a cleavage-independent termination pathway involving Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS). Termination involves RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation, but a systematic analysis of the contribution of individual residues would improve our understanding of the role of the CTD in this process. Here we investigated the effect of mutating phosphorylation sites in the CTD on termination. We observed widespread termination defects at protein-coding genes in mutants for Ser2 or Thr4 but rare defects in Tyr1 mutants for this genes class. Instead, mutating Tyr1 led to widespread termination defects at non-coding genes terminating via NNS. Finally, we showed that Tyr1 is important for pausing in the 5' end of genes and that slowing down transcription suppresses termination defects. Our work highlights the importance of Tyr1-mediated pausing in NNS-dependent termination."	0
"32605925"	"A distinct talin2 structure directs isoform specificity in cell adhesion.Integrin receptors regulate normal cellular processes such as signaling, cell migration, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and leukocyte function. Talin recruitment to the membrane is necessary for its binding to and activation of integrin. Vertebrates have two highly conserved talin homologs that differ in their expression patterns. The F1-F3 FERM subdomains of cytoskeletal proteins resemble a cloverleaf, but in talin1, its F1 subdomain and additional F0 subdomain align more linearly with its F2 and F3 subdomains. Here, we present the talin2 crystal structure, revealing that its F0-F1 di-subdomain displays another unprecedented constellation, whereby the F0-F1-F2 adopts a new cloverleaf-like arrangement. Using multiangle light scattering (MALS), fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), and FRET analyses, we found that substituting the corresponding residues in talin2 that abolish lipid binding in talin1 disrupt the binding of talin to the membrane, focal adhesion formation, and cell spreading. Our results provide the molecular details of the functions of specific talin isoforms in cell adhesion."	0

Here, we have developed a cellular model that allows the study of human AD-derived Tau propagation from neuron to neuron using microfluidic devices. We show by using high-content imaging techniques and an in-house developed interactive computer program that human AD-derived Tau seeds rodent Tau that propagates trans-neuronally in a quantifiable manner in a microfluidic culture model. Moreover, we were able to convert this model to a medium-throughput format allowing the user to handle 16 two-chamber devices simultaneously in the footprint of a standard 96-well plate. Furthermore, we show that a small molecule inhibitor of aggregation can block the trans-neuronal transfer of Tau aggregates, suggesting that the system can be used to evaluate mechanisms of Tau transfer and find therapeutic interventions."	0

Such women have normal sensory and psychometric test results, except for significantly higher cuff pressure pain. We find an excess of heterozygotes carrying the rare allele of SNP rs140124801 in KCNG4. The rare variant K<sub>V</sub>6.4-Met419 has a dominant-negative effect and cannot modulate the voltage dependence of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 inactivation because it fails to traffic to the plasma membrane. In vivo, Kcng4 (K<sub>V</sub>6.4) expression occurs in 40% of retrograde-labeled mouse uterine sensory neurons, all of which express K<sub>V</sub>2.1, and over 90% express the nociceptor genes Trpv1 and Scn10a. In neurons overexpressing K<sub>V</sub>6.4-Met419, the voltage dependence of inactivation for K<sub>V</sub>2.1 is more depolarized compared with neurons overexpressing K<sub>V</sub>6.4. Finally, K<sub>V</sub>6.4-Met419-overexpressing neurons have a higher action potential threshold.

Based on spatial correlations between gene expression and CCV differences from two independent meta-analyses and between gene expression and individual CCV distributions of 404 patients and 496 controls, we identify 417 genes associated with both CCV differences and individual CCV distributions. These genes are enriched for genetic association signals and genes downregulated in the ASD post-mortem brain. The expression patterns of these genes are correlated with brain activation patterns of language-related neural processes frequently impaired in ASD. These findings highlight a model whereby genetic risk impacts gene expression (downregulated), which leads to CCV alterations in ASD."	0
"31630969"	"An Early mtUPR: Redistribution of the Nuclear Transcription Factor Rox1 to Mitochondria Protects against Intramitochondrial Proteotoxic Aggregates.The mitochondrial proteome is built mainly by import of nuclear-encoded precursors, which are targeted mostly by cleavable presequences. Presequence processing upon import is essential for proteostasis and survival, but the consequences of dysfunctional protein maturation are unknown. We find that impaired presequence processing causes accumulation of precursors inside mitochondria that form aggregates, which escape degradation and unexpectedly do not cause cell death. Instead, cells survive via activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-like pathway that is triggered very early after precursor accumulation. In contrast to classical stress pathways, this immediate response maintains mitochondrial protein import, membrane potential, and translation through translocation of the nuclear HMG-box transcription factor Rox1 to mitochondria. Rox1 binds mtDNA and performs a TFAM-like function pivotal for transcription and translation. Induction of early mtUPR provides a reversible stress model to mechanistically dissect the initial steps in mtUPR pathways with the stressTFAM Rox1 as the first line of defense."	0

We devised a novel strategy to test the phenotypic impact of individual microRNA-target interactions by disrupting each predicted miRNA-binding site by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in <i>C. elegans</i> We developed a multiplexed negative selection screening approach in which edited loci are deep sequenced, and candidate sites are prioritized based on apparent selection pressure against mutations that disrupt miRNA binding. Importantly, our screen was conducted in vivo on mutant animals, allowing us to interrogate organism-level phenotypes. We used this approach to screen for phenotypic targets of the essential <i>mir-35-42</i> family. By generating 1130 novel 3'UTR alleles across all predicted targets, we identified <i>egl-1</i> as a phenotypic target whose derepression partially phenocopies the <i>mir-35-42</i> mutant phenotype by inducing embryonic lethality and low fecundity. These phenotypes can be rescued by compensatory CRISPR mutations that retarget <i>mir-35</i> to the mutant <i>egl-1</i> 3'UTR. This study demonstrates that the application of in vivo whole organismal CRISPR screening has great potential to accelerate the discovery of phenotypic negative regulatory elements in the noncoding genome."	0
"31995729"	"Liquidity Is a Critical Determinant for Selective Autophagy of Protein Condensates.Clearance of biomolecular condensates by selective autophagy is thought to play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. However, the mechanism underlying selective autophagy of condensates and whether liquidity determines a condensate's susceptibility to degradation by autophagy remain unknown. Here, we show that the selective autophagic cargo aminopeptidase I (Ape1) undergoes phase separation to form semi-liquid droplets. The Ape1-specific receptor protein Atg19 localizes to the surface of Ape1 droplets both in vitro and in vivo, with the ""floatability"" of Atg19 preventing its penetration into droplets. In vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that Atg19 and lipidated Atg8 are necessary and sufficient for selective sequestration of Ape1 droplets by membranes. This sequestration is impaired by mutational solidification of Ape1 droplets or diminished ability of Atg19 to float. Taken together, we propose that cargo liquidity and the presence of sufficient amounts of autophagic receptor on cargo are crucial for selective autophagy of biomolecular condensates."	0
"32553171"	"Lymphocyte-Specific Function of the DNA Polymerase Epsilon Subunit Pole3 Revealed by Neomorphic Alleles.Immunodeficiencies are typically caused by loss-of-function mutations in lymphocyte-specific genes. Occasionally, mutations in ubiquitous general-purpose factors, including those affecting essential components of the DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) holoenzyme, have cell-type-specific consequences. POLE3, one of the four components of the POLE holoenzyme, features a histone fold domain and a unique acidic C terminus, making it a particularly attractive candidate mediating cell type-specific activities of POLE. Mice lacking Pole3 survive up to late embryonic stages, indicating that this subunit is dispensable for DNA replication. The phenotypes of viable hypomorphic and neomorphic alleles are surprisingly tissue restricted and reveal a stage-specific function of the histone fold domain of Pole3 during T and B cell development. Gradual introduction of positively charged residues into the acidic C terminus leads to peripheral lymphopenia of increasing severity. Our findings serve as a paradigm to understand the molecular basis of cell-type-specific non-replicative functions of the ubiquitous POLE complex."	0
"31837995"	"Polycomb Group Proteins Regulate Chromatin Architecture in Mouse Oocytes and Early Embryos.In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reorganization during oocyte development. However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs. These data reveal a critical role of Polycomb in regulating chromatin architecture during mammalian oocyte growth and early development."	0

Our cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that the HCV IRES binds to the solvent side of the 40S platform of the cap-dependently translating 80S ribosome. Furthermore, we obtained the cryo-EM structures of the HCV IRES capturing the 40S subunit of the IRES-dependently translating 80S ribosome. In the elucidated structures, the HCV IRES ""body,"" consisting of domain III except for subdomain IIIb, binds to the 40S subunit, while the ""long arm,"" consisting of domain II, remains flexible and does not impede the ongoing translation. Biochemical experiments revealed that the cap-dependently translating ribosome becomes a better substrate for the HCV IRES than the free ribosome. Therefore, the HCV IRES is likely to efficiently induce the translation initiation of its downstream mRNA with the captured translating ribosome as soon as the ongoing translation terminates."	0

For the precise encoding of sound qualities, receptor potentials are shaped by K<sup>+</sup> conductances tuning the properties of the IHC membrane. Using patch-clamp and computational modeling, we unravel this membrane specialization showing that IHCs express an exclusive repertoire of six voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductances mediated by K<sub>v</sub>1.8, K<sub>v</sub>7.4, K<sub>v</sub>11.1, K<sub>v</sub>12.1, and BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels. All channels are active at rest but are triggered differentially during sound stimulation. This enables non-saturating tuning over a far larger potential range than in IHCs expressing fewer current entities. Each conductance contributes to optimizing responses, but the combined activity of all channels synergistically improves phase locking and the dynamic range of intensities that IHCs can encode. Conversely, hypothetical simpler IHCs appear limited to encode only certain aspects (frequency or intensity).

We tested integration of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto SNc neurons from genetically defined populations in dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and external globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin- and Lhx6-positive), and examined their contribution to pause-rebound firing. Activation of striosome projections, which target ""dendron bouquets"" in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound."	0
"30827740"	"Xist Deletional Analysis Reveals an Interdependency between Xist RNA and Polycomb Complexes for Spreading along the Inactive X.During X-inactivation, Xist RNA spreads along an entire chromosome to establish silencing. However, the mechanism and functional RNA elements involved in spreading remain undefined. By performing a comprehensive endogenous Xist deletion screen, we identify Repeat B as crucial for spreading Xist and maintaining Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/PRC2) along the inactive X (Xi). Unexpectedly, spreading of these three factors is inextricably linked. Deleting Repeat B or its direct binding partner, HNRNPK, compromises recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2. In turn, ablating PRC1 or PRC2 impairs Xist spreading. Therefore, Xist and Polycomb complexes require each other to propagate along the Xi, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between RNA initiator and protein effectors. Perturbing Xist/Polycomb spreading causes failure of de novo Xi silencing, with partial compensatory downregulation of the active X, and also disrupts topological Xi reconfiguration. Thus, Repeat B is a multifunctional element that integrates interdependent Xist/Polycomb spreading, silencing, and changes in chromosome architecture."	0
"32209483"	"Assembly of Peripheral Actomyosin Bundles in Epithelial Cells Is Dependent on the CaMKK2/AMPK Pathway.Defects in the maintenance of intercellular junctions are associated with loss of epithelial barrier function and consequent pathological conditions, including invasive cancers. Epithelial integrity is dependent on actomyosin bundles at adherens junctions, but the origin of these junctional bundles is incompletely understood. Here we show that peripheral actomyosin bundles can be generated from a specific actin stress fiber subtype, transverse arcs, through their lateral fusion at cell-cell contacts. Importantly, we find that assembly and maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles are dependent on the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway and that inhibition of this route leads to disruption of tension-maintaining actomyosin bundles and re-growth of stress fiber precursors. This results in redistribution of cellular forces, defects in monolayer integrity, and loss of epithelial identity. These data provide evidence that the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK pathway is critical for the maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles and thus dictates cell-cell junctions through cellular force distribution."	0

Little is known about how chemical stimuli that elicit instinctive behaviors lead to organized patterns of activity in the hypothalamus. Here, we study how a wide range of chemosignals form a discernible map of olfactory information in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) and show that different stimuli entail distinct active neural ensembles. Importantly, we demonstrate that this map depends on functional inputs from the vomeronasal organ. We present evidence that the spatial locations of active VMH ensembles are correlated with activation of distinct vomeronasal receptors and that disjunct VMH ensembles exhibit differential projection patterns. Moreover, active ensembles with distinct spatial locations are not necessarily associated with different behavior categories, such as defensive or social, calling for a revision of the currently accepted model of VMH organization."	0
"32726635"	"Bab2 Functions as an Ecdysone-Responsive Transcriptional Repressor during Drosophila Development.Drosophila development is governed by distinct ecdysone steroid pulses that initiate spatially and temporally defined gene expression programs. The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric-à-brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression. Bab2 directly binds to Sgs loci in vitro and represses all Sgs genes in vivo. Our work characterizes Bab2 as a temporal regulator of somatic gene expression in response to systemic ecdysone signaling."	1

Disease-associated mutations have been identified by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. However, aside from mutations in TP53 or the RB1 pathway that are common in HGSOC, the contributions of mutation combinations are unclear. Here, we report CRISPR mutagenesis of 20 putative HGSOC driver genes to identify combinatorial disruptions of genes that transform either ovarian surface epithelium stem cells (OSE-SCs) or non-stem cells (OSE-NSs). Our results support the OSE-SC theory of HGSOC initiation and suggest that most commonly mutated genes in HGSOC have no effect on OSE-SC transformation initiation. Our results indicate that disruption of TP53 and PTEN, combined with RB1 disruption, constitutes a core set of mutations driving efficient transformation in vitro. The combined data may contribute to more accurate modeling of HGSOC development."	0

Yet, how the DNA sequence determines which TF complex forms at any given site is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that high-throughput in vitro DNA binding assays coupled with unbiased computational analysis provide unprecedented insight into how different DNA sequences select distinct compositions and configurations of homeodomain TF complexes. Using inferred knowledge about minor groove width readout, we design targeted protein mutations that destabilize homeodomain binding both in vitro and in vivo in a complex-specific manner. By performing parallel systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment sequencing (SELEX-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Hi-C assays, we not only classify the majority of in vivo binding events in terms of complex composition but also infer complex-specific functions by perturbing the gene regulatory network controlled by a single complex."	0
"32668252"	"Heterogeneous Effects of Calorie Content and Nutritional Components Underlie Dietary Influence on Pancreatic Cancer Susceptibility.Pancreatic cancer is a rare but fatal form of cancer, the fourth highest in absolute mortality. Known risk factors include obesity, diet, and type 2 diabetes; however, the low incidence rate and interconnection of these factors confound the isolation of individual effects. Here, we use epidemiological analysis of prospective human cohorts and parallel tracking of pancreatic cancer in mice to dissect the effects of obesity, diet, and diabetes on pancreatic cancer. Through longitudinal monitoring and multi-omics analysis in mice, we found distinct effects of protein, sugar, and fat dietary components, with dietary sugars increasing Mad2l1 expression and tumor proliferation. Using epidemiological approaches in humans, we find that dietary sugars give a MAD2L1 genotype-dependent increased susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. The translation of these results to a clinical setting could aid in the identification of the at-risk population for screening and potentially harness dietary modification as a therapeutic measure."	0
"32521280"	"ELKS1 Captures Rab6-Marked Vesicular Cargo in Presynaptic Nerve Terminals.Neurons face unique transport challenges. They need to deliver cargo over long axonal distances and to many presynaptic nerve terminals. Rab GTPases are master regulators of vesicular traffic, but essential presynaptic Rabs have not been identified. Here, we find that Rab6, a Golgi-derived GTPase for constitutive secretion, associates with mobile axonal cargo and localizes to nerve terminals. ELKS1 is a stationary presynaptic protein with Golgin homology that binds to Rab6. Knockout and rescue experiments for ELKS1 and Rab6 establish that ELKS1 captures Rab6 cargo. The ELKS1-Rab6-capturing mechanism can be transferred to mitochondria by mistargeting ELKS1 or Rab6 to them. We conclude that nerve terminals have repurposed mechanisms from constitutive exocytosis for their highly regulated secretion. By employing Golgin-like mechanisms with anchored ELKS extending its coiled-coils to capture Rab6 cargo, they have spatially separated cargo capture from fusion. ELKS complexes connect to active zones and may mediate vesicle progression toward release sites."	1
"32553162"	"Differential Cellular Response to Translocated Toxic Effectors and Physical Penetration by the Type VI Secretion System.The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal microbial weapon that injects a large needle-like structure carrying toxic effectors into recipient cells through physical penetration. How recipients respond to physical force and effectors remains elusive. Here, we use a series of effector mutants of Vibrio cholerae to determine how T6SS elicits response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. We show that TseL, but no other effectors or physical puncture, triggers the tit-for-tat response of P. aeruginosa H1-T6SS. Although E. coli is sensitive to all periplasmically expressed effectors, P. aeruginosa is most sensitive to TseL alone. We identify a number of stress response pathways that confer protection against TseL. Physical puncture of T6SS has a moderate inhibitory effect only on envelope-impaired tolB and rseA mutants. Our data reveal that recipient cells primarily respond to effector toxicity but not to physical contact, and they rely on the stress response for immunity-independent protection."	0
"31668929"	"Mechanisms Controlling PD-L1 Expression in Cancer.The engagement of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; encoded by the PDCD1 gene) receptor expressed on activated T cells and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; encoded by the CD274 gene), is a major co-inhibitory checkpoint signaling that controls T cell activities. Various types of cancers express high levels of PD-L1 and exploit PD-L1/PD-1 signaling to evade T cell immunity. Blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has consistently shown remarkable anti-tumor effects in patients with advanced cancers and is recognized as the gold standard for developing new immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and combination therapies. However, the response rates of anti-PD-L1 have been limited in several solid tumors. Therefore, furthering our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 can bring substantial benefits to patients with cancer by improving the efficacy of current PD-L1/PD-1 blockade or other ICBs. In this review, we provide current knowledge of PD-L1 regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, post-translational, and extracellular levels, and discuss the implications of these findings in cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy."	0
"31442426"	"Proximity RNA Labeling by APEX-Seq Reveals the Organization of Translation Initiation Complexes and Repressive RNA Granules.Diverse ribonucleoprotein complexes control mRNA processing, translation, and decay. Transcripts in these complexes localize to specific regions of the cell and can condense into non-membrane-bound structures such as stress granules. It has proven challenging to map the RNA composition of these large and dynamic structures, however. We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq, which uses the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to probe the spatial organization of the transcriptome. We show that APEX-seq can resolve the localization of RNAs within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key RNA-binding proteins. Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-seq, with the spatial proteome determined by APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS), obtained precisely in parallel, provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs and unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition. Our novel technique allows a powerful and general approach to explore the spatial environment of macromolecules."	0
"32160551"	"NRBP1-Containing CRL2/CRL4A Regulates Amyloid β Production by Targeting BRI2 and BRI3 for Degradation.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulations of Aβ peptides. Production and fibrillation of Aβ are downregulated by BRI2 and BRI3, which are physiological inhibitors of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Aβ oligomerization. Here, we identify nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) as a substrate receptor of a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) that targets BRI2 and BRI3 for degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate that (1) dimerized NRBP1 assembles into a functional Cul2- and Cul4A-containing heterodimeric CRL through its BC-box and an overlapping cryptic H-box, (2) both Cul2 and Cul4A contribute to NRBP1 CRL function, and (3) formation of the NRBP1 heterodimeric CRL is strongly enhanced by chaperone-like function of TSC22D3 and TSC22D4. NRBP1 knockdown in neuronal cells results in an increase in the abundance of BRI2 and BRI3 and significantly reduces Aβ production. Thus, disrupting interactions between NRBP1 and its substrates BRI2 and BRI3 may provide a useful therapeutic strategy for AD."	1

We investigated the infection of human cells using Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and influenza A virus and identified hundreds of direct RNA-protein interactions. Here, we explore the biological impact of three protein classes that bind CHIKV RNA within minutes of infection. We find CHIKV RNA binds and hijacks the lipid-modifying enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) for pro-viral activity. We show that CHIKV genomes are N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine modified, and YTHDF1 binds and suppresses CHIKV replication. Finally, we find that the innate immune DNA sensor IFI16 associates with CHIKV RNA, reducing viral replication and maturation. Our findings have direct applicability to the investigation of potentially all RNA viruses."	0

The paracrine pathway for MSC-mediated IL-10<sup>+</sup> macrophage functionality and response to tissue injury is not fully understood. In our present study, clodronate pre-treatment of colitic mice confirms the essential role of endogenous macrophages in bone-marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC)-mediated clinical rescue of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.

"30878283"	"Co-translational, Post-translational, and Non-catalytic Roles of N-Terminal Acetyltransferases.Recent studies of N-terminal acetylation have identified new N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and expanded the known functions of these enzymes beyond their roles as ribosome-associated co-translational modifiers. For instance, the identification of Golgi- and chloroplast-associated NATs shows that acetylation of N termini also happens post-translationally. In addition, we now appreciate that some NATs are highly specific; for example, a dedicated NAT responsible for post-translational N-terminal acetylation of actin was recently revealed. Other studies have extended NAT function beyond Nt acetylation, including functions as lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and non-catalytic roles. Finally, emerging studies emphasize the physiological relevance of N-terminal acetylation, including roles in calorie-restriction-induced longevity and pathological α-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Combined, the NATs rise as multifunctional proteins, and N-terminal acetylation is gaining recognition as a major cellular regulator."	0
"32665400"	"The staphylococcal biofilm protein Aap forms a tetrameric species as a necessary intermediate before amyloidogenesis.The accumulation-associated protein (Aap) from <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> is a biofilm-related protein that was found to be a critical factor for infection using a rat catheter model. The B-repeat superdomain of Aap, composed of 5-17 B-repeats, each containing a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding G5 and a spacer subdomain, is responsible for Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent assembly leading to accumulation of bacteria during biofilm formation. We previously demonstrated that a minimal B-repeat construct (Brpt1.5) forms an antiparallel dimer in the presence of 2-3 Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. More recently, we have reported the presence of functional amyloid-like fibrils composed of Aap within <i>S. epidermidis</i> biofilms and demonstrated that a biologically relevant construct containing five and a half B-repeats (Brpt5.5) forms amyloid-like fibrils similar to those observed in the biofilm. In this study, we analyze the initial assembly events of the Brpt5.5 construct. Analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to determine hydrodynamic parameters of reversibly associating species and to perform linked equilibrium studies. Linkage studies indicated a mechanism of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced dimerization similar to smaller constructs; however, Brpt5.5 dimers could then undergo further Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced assembly into a previously uncharacterized tetramer. This led us to search for potential Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites outside of the dimer interface. We developed a Brpt5.5 mutant that was unable to form the tetramer and was concordantly incapable of amyloidogenesis. CD and dynamic light scattering indicate that a conformational transition in the tetramer species is a critical step preceding amyloidogenesis. This mechanistic model for B-repeat assembly and amyloidogenesis provides new avenues for potential therapeutic targeting of staphylococcal biofilms."	0

Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P) and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation."	0

We performed RNA-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq to define the transcriptomes and epigenomes of cells representing key developmental stages of HSC ontogeny in mice. The five populations analyzed were embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) endothelium and hemogenic endothelium from the major arteries, an enriched population of prehematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), fetal liver HSCs, and adult bone marrow HSCs. Using epigenetic signatures, we identified enhancers for each developmental stage. Only 12% of enhancers are primed, and 78% are active, suggesting the vast majority of enhancers are established de novo without prior priming in earlier stages. We constructed developmental stage-specific transcriptional regulatory networks by linking enhancers and predicted bound transcription factors to their target promoters using a novel computational algorithm, target inference via physical connection (TIPC). TIPC predicted known transcriptional regulators for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, validating our overall approach, and identified putative novel transcription factors, including the broadly expressed transcription factors SP3 and MAZ. Finally, we validated a role for SP3 and MAZ in the formation of hemogenic endothelium. Our data and computational analyses provide a useful resource for uncovering regulators of HSC formation."	0

Loss of genes that drive endodermal lineage specification, HNF4A and GATA6, switch metabolic profiles from classical (pancreatic) to predominantly squamous, with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) a key regulator of glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β results in selective sensitivity in the squamous subtype; however, a subset of these squamous patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs) acquires rapid drug tolerance. Using chromatin accessibility maps, we demonstrate that the squamous subtype can be further classified using chromatin accessibility to predict responsiveness and tolerance to GSK3β inhibitors.

PKR inhibits translation initiation through eIF2α phosphorylation, which triggers stress granule (SG) formation and promotes translation of stress responsive mRNAs. The mechanisms of RNase L-driven translation repression, its contribution to SG assembly, and its regulation of dsRNA stress-induced mRNAs are unknown. We demonstrate that RNase L drives translational shut-off in response to dsRNA by promoting widespread turnover of mRNAs. This alters stress granule assembly and reprograms translation by allowing translation of mRNAs resistant to RNase L degradation, including numerous antiviral mRNAs such as interferon (IFN)-β. Individual cells differentially activate dsRNA responses revealing variation that can affect cellular outcomes. This identifies bulk mRNA degradation and the resistance of antiviral mRNAs as the mechanism by which RNase L reprograms translation in response to dsRNA."	0

During infection, hGBP1 is recruited to pathogen-containing vacuoles, such as Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions, restricts pathogenic growth, and induces the activation of the inflammasome pathway. hGBP1 has a unique catalytic activity to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in two consecutive cleavage steps. However, the functional significance of this activity in host defense remains elusive. Here, we generate a structure-guided mutant that specifically abrogates GMP production, while maintaining fast cooperative GTP hydrolysis. Complementation experiments in human monocytes/macrophages show that hGBP1-mediated GMP production is dispensable for restricting Chlamydia trachomatis growth but is necessary for inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, GMP is catabolized to uric acid, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Using photoactivated localization microscopy and single-molecule tracking, we demonstrate that Hfq forms a distinct and reversible focus-like structure in <i>Escherichia coli</i> specifically experiencing long-term nitrogen starvation. Using the ability of T7 phage to replicate in nitrogen-starved bacteria as a biological probe of <i>E. coli</i> cell function during nitrogen starvation, we demonstrate that Hfq foci have a role in the adaptive response of <i>E. coli</i> to long-term nitrogen starvation. We further show that Hfq foci formation does not depend on gene expression once nitrogen starvation has set in and occurs indepen-dently of the transcription factor N-regulatory protein C, which activates the initial adaptive response to N starvation in <i>E. coli</i> These results serve as a paradigm to demonstrate that bacterial adaptation to long-term nutrient starvation can be spatiotemporally coordinated and can occur independently of <i>de novo</i> gene expression during starvation."	0
"32533919"	"Stress Can Induce Transcription of Toxin-Antitoxin Systems without Activating Toxin.Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous genetic elements in bacterial genomes, but their functions are controversial.

Here, we show that TA transcript levels can increase substantially in response to stress, but toxin is not liberated. We find that the growth of an Escherichia coli strain lacking ten TA systems encoding endoribonuclease toxins is not affected following exposure to six stresses that each trigger TA transcription. Additionally, using RNA sequencing, we find no evidence of mRNA cleavage following stress. Stress-induced transcription arises from antitoxin degradation and relief of transcriptional autoregulation. Importantly, although free antitoxin is readily degraded in vivo, antitoxin bound to toxin is protected from proteolysis, preventing release of active toxin. Thus, transcription is not a reliable marker of TA activity, and TA systems do not strongly promote survival following individual stresses."	0

Here, we present the structure-function relationship of Cmr-β, unveiling how binding of the target RNA regulates the Cmr2 activities. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed the unique subunit architecture of Cmr-β and captured the complex in different conformational stages of the immune response, including the non-cognate and cognate target-RNA-bound complexes. The binding of the target RNA induces a conformational change of Cmr2, which together with the complementation between the 5' tag in the CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) and the 3' antitag of the target RNA activate different configurations in a unique loop of the Cmr3 subunit, which acts as an allosteric sensor signaling the self- versus non-self-recognition. These findings highlight the diverse defense strategies of type III complexes."	0
"32579934"	"Skeletal Muscle Transcriptomic Comparison between Long-Term Trained and Untrained Men and Women.To better understand the health benefits of lifelong exercise in humans, we conduct global skeletal muscle transcriptomic analyses of long-term endurance- (9 men, 9 women) and strength-trained (7 men) humans compared with age-matched untrained controls (7 men, 8 women). Transcriptomic analysis, Gene Ontology, and genome-scale metabolic modeling demonstrate changes in pathways related to the prevention of metabolic diseases, particularly with endurance training. Our data also show prominent sex differences between controls and that these differences are reduced with endurance training. Additionally, we compare our data with studies examining muscle gene expression before and after a months-long training period in individuals with metabolic diseases. This analysis reveals that training shifts gene expression in individuals with impaired metabolism to become more similar to our endurance-trained group. Overall, our data provide an extensive examination of the accumulated transcriptional changes that occur with decades-long training and identify important ""exercise-responsive"" genes that could attenuate metabolic disease."	0

The anaerobic biosynthesis of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), the lower ligand of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, involves five reactions catalyzed by the <i>bza</i> operon gene products, namely the hydroxybenzimidazole synthase BzaAB/BzaF, phosphoribosyltransferase CobT, and three methyltransferases, BzaC, BzaD, and BzaE, that conduct three distinct methylation steps. Of these, the methyltransferases that contribute to benzimidazole lower ligand diversity in cobamides remain to be characterized, and the precise role of the <i>bza</i> operon protein CobT is unclear. In this study, we used the <i>bza</i> operon from the anaerobic bacterium <i>Moorella thermoacetica</i> (comprising <i>bzaA-bzaB-cobT-bzaC</i>) to examine the role of CobT and investigate the activity of the first methyltransferase, BzaC. We studied the phosphoribosylation catalyzed by <i>Mt</i>CobT and found that it regiospecifically activates 5-hydroxybenzimidazole (5-OHBza) to form the 5-OHBza-ribotide (5-OHBza-RP) isomer as the sole product. Next, we characterized the domains of <i>Mt</i>BzaC and reconstituted its methyltransferase activity with the predicted substrate 5-OHBza and with two alternative substrates, the <i>Mt</i>CobT product 5-OHBza-RP and its riboside derivative 5-OHBza-R. Unexpectedly, we found that 5-OHBza-R is the most favored <i>Mt</i>BzaC substrate. Our results collectively explain the long-standing observation that the attachment of the lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis is regiospecific. In conclusion, we validate <i>Mt</i>BzaC as a SAM:hydroxybenzimidazole-riboside methyltransferase (HBIR-OMT). Finally, we propose a new pathway for the synthesis and activation of the benzimidazolyl lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis."	0
"32470318"	"Ectosomal PKM2 Promotes HCC by Inducing Macrophage Differentiation and Remodeling the Tumor Microenvironment.Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles are important mediators of cell-to-cell communication during tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived ectosomes remodel the tumor microenvironment to facilitate HCC progression in an ectosomal PKM2-dependent manner. HCC-derived ectosomal PKM2 induced not only metabolic reprogramming in monocytes but also STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus to upregulate differentiation-associated transcription factors, leading to monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and tumor microenvironment remodeling. In HCC cells, sumoylation of PKM2 induced its plasma membrane targeting and subsequent ectosomal excretion via interactions with ARRDC1. The PKM2-ARRDC1 association in HCC was reinforced by macrophage-secreted cytokines/chemokines in a CCL1-CCR8 axis-dependent manner, further facilitating PKM2 excretion from HCC cells to form a feedforward regulatory loop for tumorigenesis. In the clinic, ectosomal PKM2 was clearly detected in the plasma of HCC patients. This study highlights a mechanism by which ectosomal PKM2 remodels the tumor microenvironment and reveals ectosomal PKM2 as a potential diagnostic marker for HCC."	1
"32726621"	"Active Lysogeny in Listeria Monocytogenes Is a Bacteria-Phage Adaptive Response in the Mammalian Environment.Some Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) strains harbor a prophage within the comK gene, which renders it inactive. During Lm infection of macrophage cells, the prophage turns into a molecular switch, promoting comK gene expression and therefore Lm intracellular growth. During this process, the prophage does not produce infective phages or cause bacterial lysis, suggesting it has acquired an adaptive behavior suited to the pathogenic lifestyle of its host. In this study, we demonstrate that this non-classical phage behavior, named active lysogeny, relies on a transcriptional response that is specific to the intracellular niche. While the prophage undergoes lytic induction, the process is arrested midway, preventing the transcription of the late genes. Further, we demonstrate key phage factors, such as LlgA transcription regulator and a DNA replicase, that support the phage adaptive behavior. This study provides molecular insights into the adaptation of phages to their pathogenic hosts, uncovering unusual cooperative interactions."	0
"31812350"	"Targeting UBE4A Revives Viperin Protein in Epithelium to Enhance Host Antiviral Defense.Mutation and prevalence of pathogenic viruses prompt the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Viperin is a potent antiviral protein that inhibits a broad range of viruses. Unexpectedly, we found that Viperin protein production in epithelium is defective in response to both viruses and interferons (IFNs). We further revealed that viruses and IFNs stimulate expression of the acetyltransferase HAT1, which induces Lys197-acetylation on Viperin. Viperin acetylation in turn recruits UBE4A that stimulates K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys206 of Viperin, leading to Viperin protein degradation. Importantly, UBE4A deficiency restores Viperin protein production in epithelium. We then designed interfering peptides (IPs) to inhibit UBE4A binding with Viperin. We found that VIP-IP3 rescues Viperin protein production in epithelium and therefore enhances cellular antiviral activity. VIP-IP3 renders mice more resistant to viral infection. These findings could provide strategies for both enhancing host broad-spectrum antiviral response and improving the efficacy of IFN-based antiviral therapy."	1
"31522987"	"Distinct Classes of Chromatin Loops Revealed by Deletion of an RNA-Binding Region in CTCF.Mammalian genomes are folded into topologically associating domains (TADs), consisting of chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Some loops are cell-type specific. Here we asked whether CTCF loops are established by a universal or locus-specific mechanism. Investigating the molecular determinants of CTCF clustering, we found that CTCF self-association in vitro is RNase sensitive and that an internal RNA-binding region (RBR<sub>i</sub>) mediates CTCF clustering and RNA interaction in vivo. Strikingly, deleting the RBR<sub>i</sub> impairs about half of all chromatin loops in mESCs and causes deregulation of gene expression. Disrupted loop formation correlates with diminished clustering and chromatin binding of RBR<sub>i</sub> mutant CTCF, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least two classes: RBR<sub>i</sub>-independent and RBR<sub>i</sub>-dependent loops. We speculate that evidence for RBR<sub>i</sub>-dependent loops may provide a molecular mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops, potentially regulated by RNA(s) or other RBR<sub>i</sub>-interacting partners."	0
"32554468"	"Discordance between GLP-1R gene and protein expression in mouse pancreatic islet cells.The insulinotropic actions of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) in β-cells have made it a useful target to manage type 2 diabetes. Metabolic stress reduces β-cell sensitivity to GLP-1, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that <i>Glp1r</i> expression is heterogeneous among β-cells and that metabolic stress decreases the number of GLP-1R-positive β-cells. Here, analyses of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq sequencing (scRNASeq) data from mouse and human β-cells indicated that significant populations of β-cells do not express the <i>Glp1r</i> gene, supporting heterogeneous GLP-1R expression. To check these results, we used complementary approaches employing FACS coupled with quantitative RT-PCR, a validated GLP-1R antibody, and flow cytometry to quantify GLP-1R promoter activity, gene expression, and protein expression in mouse α-, β-, and δ-cells. Experiments with <i>Glp1r</i> reporter mice and a validated GLP-1R antibody indicated that >90% of the β-cells are GLP-1R positive, contradicting the findings with the scRNASeq data. α-cells did not express <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA and δ-cells expressed <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA but not protein. We also examined the expression patterns of GLP-1R in mouse models of metabolic stress. Multiparous female mice had significantly decreased β-cell <i>Glp1r</i> expression, but no reduction in GLP-1R protein levels or GLP-1R-mediated insulin secretion. These findings suggest caution in interpreting the results of scRNASeq for low-abundance transcripts such as the incretin receptors and indicate that GLP-1R is widely expressed in β-cells, absent in α-cells, and expressed at the mRNA, but not protein, level in δ-cells."	0
"32747476"	"FoxA factors: the chromatin key and doorstop essential for liver development and function.Pioneer factors are transcriptional regulators with the capacity to bind inactive regions of chromatin and induce changes in accessibility that underpin cell fate decisions. The FOXA family of transcription factors is well understood to have pioneer capacity. Indeed, researchers have uncovered numerous examples of FOXA-dependent epigenomic modulation in developmental and disease processes. Despite the presence of FOXA being essential for correct epigenetic patterning, the need for continued FOXA presence postchromatin modulation has been debated. In a recent study in this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Reizel and colleagues (pp. 1039-1050) show that the tissue-specific ablation of FOXA1/2/3 in the adult mouse liver results in the collapse of the epigenetic profile that maintains the hepatic gene expression profile. Thus, FOXA functions as a key, opening regions of chromatin during development, and as a doorstep, maintaining the established euchromatic structure in adult tissue."	0

"32433968"	"ATF4-Induced Warburg Metabolism Drives Over-Proliferation in Drosophila.The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enables essential metabolic reactions; nonetheless, the cellular responses to defects in mitochondria and the modulation of signaling pathway outputs are not understood. We show that Notch signaling and ETC attenuation via knockdown of COX7a induces massive over-proliferation. The tumor-like growth is caused by a transcriptional response through the eIF2α-kinase PERK and ATF4, which activates the expression of metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters, and mitochondrial chaperones. We find this stress adaptation to be beneficial for progenitor cell fitness, as it renders cells sensitive to proliferation induced by the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, over-proliferation is not caused by transcriptional cooperation of Notch and ATF4, but it is mediated in part by pH changes resulting from the Warburg metabolism induced by ETC attenuation. Our results suggest that ETC function is monitored by the PERK-ATF4 pathway, which can be hijacked by growth-promoting signaling pathways, leading to oncogenic pathway activity."	0
"32668258"	"Mitochondria-Associated Degradation Pathway (MAD) Function beyond the Outer Membrane.The mitochondria-associated degradation pathway (MAD) mediates ubiquitination and degradation of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins by the proteasome. We find that the MAD, but not other quality-control pathways including macroautophagy, mitophagy, or mitochondrial chaperones and proteases, is critical for yeast cellular fitness under conditions of paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stress in mitochondria. Specifically, inhibition of the MAD increases PQ-induced defects in growth and mitochondrial quality and decreases chronological lifespan. We use mass spectrometry analysis to identify possible MAD substrates as mitochondrial proteins that exhibit increased ubiquitination in response to PQ treatment and inhibition of the MAD. We identify candidate substrates in the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane and confirm that two matrix proteins are MAD substrates. Our studies reveal a broader function for the MAD in mitochondrial protein surveillance beyond the MOM and a major role for the MAD in cellular and mitochondrial fitness in response to chronic, low-level oxidative stress in mitochondria."	0
"32814045"	"Identification of a pH-Sensitive Switch in VSV-G and a Crystal Structure of the G Pre-fusion State Highlight the VSV-G Structural Transition Pathway.VSV fusion machinery, like that of many other enveloped viruses, is triggered at low pH in endosomes after virion endocytosis. It was suggested that some histidines could play the role of pH-sensitive switches. By mutating histidine residues H22, H60, H132, H162, H389, H397, H407, and H409, we demonstrate that residues H389 and D280, facing each other in the six-helix bundle of the post-fusion state, and more prominently H407, located at the interface between the C-terminal part of the ectodomain and the fusion domain, are crucial for fusion. Passages of recombinant viruses bearing mutant G resulted in the selection of compensatory mutations. Thus, the H407A mutation in G resulted in two independent compensatory mutants, L396I and S422I. Together with a crystal structure of G, presented here, which extends our knowledge of G pre-fusion structure, this indicates that the conformational transition is initiated by refolding of the C-terminal part of the G ectodomain."	0
"32755583"	"Macrophage K63-Linked Ubiquitination of YAP Promotes Its Nuclear Localization and Exacerbates Atherosclerosis.The Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway has pivotal roles in innate immune responses against pathogens in macrophages. However, the role of YAP in macrophages during atherosclerosis and its mechanism of YAP activation remain unknown. Here, we find that YAP overexpression in myeloid cells aggravates atherosclerotic lesion size and infiltration of macrophages, whereas YAP deficiency reduces atherosclerotic plaque. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a downstream effector of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), triggers YAP ubiquitination at K252, which interrupts the interaction between YAP and angiomotin and results in enhanced YAP nuclear translocation. The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra reduces atherosclerotic lesion formation, which is abrogated by YAP overexpression. YAP level is increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic vessels, and plasma IL-1β level in patients with STEMI is correlated with YAP protein level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These findings elucidate a mechanism of YAP activation, which might be a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis."	0
"30612878"	"RNA Polymerase I Activators Count and Adjust Ribosomal RNA Gene Copy Number.Ribosome is the most abundant RNA-protein complex in a cell, and many copies of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) have to be maintained. However, arrays of tandemly repeated rDNA genes can lose the copies by intra-repeat recombination. Loss of the rDNA copies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is counteracted by gene amplification whereby the number of rDNA repeats stabilizes around 150 copies, suggesting the presence of a monitoring mechanism that counts and adjusts the number. Here, we report that, in response to rDNA copy loss, the upstream activating factor (UAF) for RNA polymerase I that transcribes the rDNA is released and directly binds to a RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene, SIR2, whose gene products silence rDNA recombination, to repress. We show that the amount of UAF determines the rDNA copy number that is stably maintained. UAF ensures rDNA production not only by rDNA transcription activation but also by its copy-number maintenance."	0

However, to date, the organizing principles that underlie the morphogenesis of this network and that shape the initial process of cells' finding one another remain elusive. Here, we identify a mechanism that allows cells to form networks by mechanically reorganizing and stiffening their extracellular matrix, independent of chemical guidance cues. Interestingly, we find that this cellular self-organization strongly depends on the connectivity, plasticity, and topology of the surrounding matrix; cell contractility; and cell density. Cells rearrange the matrix and form bridges of matrix material that are stiffer than their surroundings, thus creating a durotactic track for the initiation of cell protrusions and cell-cell contacts. This contractility-based communication via strain stiffening and matrix rearrangement might be a general organizing principle during tissue development or regeneration."	0
"31968250"	"Vitamin D Receptor Controls Cell Stemness in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and in Normal Bone Marrow.Vitamin D (VD) is a known differentiating agent, but the role of VD receptor (VDR) is still incompletely described in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whose treatment is based mostly on antimitotic chemotherapy. Here, we present an unexpected role of VDR in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis. Limited VDR expression is associated with impaired myeloid progenitor differentiation and is a new prognostic factor in AML. In mice, the lack of Vdr results in increased numbers of hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells and quiescent hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, malignant transformation of Vdr<sup>-/-</sup> cells results in myeloid differentiation block and increases self-renewal. Vdr promoter is methylated in AML as in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and demethylating agents induce VDR expression. Association of VDR agonists with hypomethylating agents promotes leukemia stem cell exhaustion and decreases tumor burden in AML mouse models. Thus, Vdr functions as a regulator of stem cell homeostasis and leukemic propagation."	0
"32579932"	"mTOR Signaling and SREBP Activity Increase FADS2 Expression and Can Activate Sapienate Biosynthesis.Cancer cells display an increased plasticity in their lipid metabolism, which includes the conversion of palmitate to sapienate via the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2). We find that FADS2 expression correlates with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity across multiple cancer types and is prognostic in some cancer types. Accordingly, activating mTOR signaling by deleting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) or overexpression of SREBP-1/2 is sufficient to increase FADS2 mRNA expression and sapienate metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and U87 glioblastoma cells, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR signaling decreases FADS2 expression and sapienate biosynthesis in MEFs with Tsc2 deletion, HUH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and orthotopic HUH7 liver xenografts. In conclusion, we show that mTOR signaling and SREBP activity are sufficient to activate sapienate metabolism by increasing FADS2 expression. Consequently, targeting mTOR signaling can reduce sapienate metabolism in vivo."	1
"32023472"	"Hyperexcitable Neurons Enable Precise and Persistent Information Encoding in the Superficial Retrosplenial Cortex.The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is essential for memory and navigation, but the neural codes underlying these functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the most prominent cell type in layers 2/3 (L2/3) of the mouse granular RSC is a hyperexcitable, small pyramidal cell. These cells have a low rheobase (LR), high input resistance, lack of spike frequency adaptation, and spike widths intermediate to those of neighboring fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons and regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons. LR cells are excitatory but rarely synapse onto neighboring neurons. Instead, L2/3 is a feedforward, not feedback, inhibition-dominated network with dense connectivity between FS cells and from FS to LR neurons. Biophysical models of LR but not RS cells precisely and continuously encode sustained input from afferent postsubicular head-direction cells. Thus, the distinct intrinsic properties of LR neurons can support both the precision and persistence necessary to encode information over multiple timescales in the RSC."	0
"32640193"	"Proline Hydroxylation Primes Protein Kinases for Autophosphorylation and Activation.Activation of dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinases 1A and 1B (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) requires prolyl hydroxylation by PHD1 prolyl hydroxylase. Prolyl hydroxylation of DYRK1 initiates a cascade of events leading to the release of molecular constraints on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase tumor suppressor function. However, the proline residue of DYRK1 targeted by hydroxylation and the role of prolyl hydroxylation in tyrosine autophosphorylation of DYRK1 are unknown. We found that a highly conserved proline in the CMGC insert of the DYRK1 kinase domain is hydroxylated by PHD1, and this event precedes tyrosine autophosphorylation. Mutation of the hydroxylation acceptor proline precludes tyrosine autophosphorylation and folding of DYRK1, resulting in a kinase unable to preserve VHL function and lacking glioma suppression activity. The consensus proline sequence is shared by most CMGC kinases, and prolyl hydroxylation is essential for catalytic activation. Thus, formation of prolyl-hydroxylated intermediates is a novel mechanism of kinase maturation and likely a general mechanism of regulation of CMGC kinases in eukaryotes."	0
"30503771"	"Iruka Eliminates Dysfunctional Argonaute by Selective Ubiquitination of Its Empty State.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are loaded into the Argonaute subfamily of proteins (AGO) to form an effector complex that silences target genes. Empty but not miRNA-loaded AGO is selectively degraded across species. However, the mechanism and biological significance of selective AGO degradation remain unclear. We discovered a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase we named Iruka (Iru), which selectively ubiquitinates the empty form of Drosophila Ago1 to trigger its degradation. Iru preferentially binds empty Ago1 and ubiquitinates Lys514 in the L2 linker, which is predicted to be inaccessible in the miRNA-loaded state. Depletion of Iru results in global impairment of miRNA-mediated silencing of target genes and in the accumulation of aberrant Ago1 that is dysfunctional for canonical protein-protein interactions and miRNA loading. Our findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism for the selective degradation of empty AGO that underlies a quality control process to ensure AGO function."	0

RJ treatment also reportedly protects against bone loss, but no single factor in RJ has yet been identified as an anti-osteoporosis agent. Here we fractionated RJ and identified 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA) as a key component involved in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis based on mass spectrometric analysis. We further demonstrated free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) as directly interacting with 10H2DA; binding of 10H2DA to FFAR4 on osteoclasts inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced activation of NF-κB signaling, thereby attenuating the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1, a key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. Oral administration of 10H2DA attenuated bone resorption in ovariectomized mice.

We demonstrate that a short Q/N-rich peptide corresponding to a proposed nucleation site in the prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion protein Sup35 is sufficient to induce infectious cytosolic prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells ectopically expressing the soluble Sup35 NM prion domain. Embedding this nucleating core in a non-native N-rich sequence that does not form amyloid but acts as an entropic bristle quadruples seeding efficiency.

Multiple early post-fusion steps of HIV-1 replication are restricted in resting peripheral blood CD4 T cells; however, molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic control of these steps remain undefined. Here, we show that mTOR activity following T cell stimulatory signals overcomes metabolic restrictions in these cells by enabling the expansion of dNTPs to fuel HIV-1 reverse transcription (RT), as well as increasing acetyl-CoA to stabilize microtubules that transport RT products. We find that catalytic mTOR inhibition diminishes the expansion of pools of both of these metabolites by limiting glucose and glutamine utilization in several pathways, thereby suppressing HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate how mTOR-coordinated biosyntheses enable the early steps of HIV-1 replication, add metabolic mechanisms by which mTOR inhibitors block HIV-1, and identify some metabolic modules downstream of mTOR as druggable targets for HIV-1 inhibition."	0
"32640219"	"The ZGRF1 Helicase Promotes Recombinational Repair of Replication-Blocking DNA Damage in Human Cells.Replication-blocking DNA lesions are particularly toxic to proliferating cells because they can lead to chromosome mis-segregation if not repaired prior to mitosis. In this study, we report that ZGRF1 null cells accumulate chromosome aberrations following replication perturbation and show sensitivity to two potent replication-blocking anticancer drugs: mitomycin C and camptothecin. Moreover, ZGRF1 null cells are defective in catalyzing DNA damage-induced sister chromatid exchange despite accumulating excessive FANCD2, RAD51, and γ-H2AX foci upon induction of interstrand DNA crosslinks. Consistent with a direct role in promoting recombinational DNA repair, we show that ZGRF1 is a 5'-to-3' helicase that catalyzes D-loop dissociation and Holliday junction branch migration. Moreover, ZGRF1 physically interacts with RAD51 and stimulates strand exchange catalyzed by RAD51-RAD54. On the basis of these data, we propose that ZGRF1 promotes repair of replication-blocking DNA lesions through stimulation of homologous recombination."	0

Here, we report that a human nucleolus consists of several dozen FC/DFC units, each containing 2-3 transcriptionally active rDNAs at the FC/DFC border. Pre-rRNA processing factors, such as fibrillarin (FBL), form 18-24 clusters that further assemble into the DFC surrounding the FC. Mechanistically, the 5' end of nascent 47S pre-rRNA binds co-transcriptionally to the RNA-binding domain of FBL. FBL diffuses to the DFC, where local self-association via its glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain forms phase-separated clusters to immobilize FBL-interacting pre-rRNA, thus promoting directional traffic of nascent pre-rRNA while facilitating pre-rRNA processing and DFC formation. These results unveil FC/DFC ultrastructures in nucleoli and suggest a conceptual framework for considering nascent RNA sorting using multivalent interactions of their binding proteins."	0

To determine whether HMCES responds to the ssDNA abasic site in cells, we exploited the activity of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A). APOBEC3A preferentially deaminates cytosines to uracils in ssDNA, which are then converted to abasic sites by uracil DNA glycosylase. We find that HMCES-deficient cells are hypersensitive to nuclear APOBEC3A localization. HMCES relocalizes to chromatin in response to nuclear APOBEC3A and protects abasic sites from processing into double-strand breaks (DSBs). Abasic sites induced by APOBEC3A slow both leading and lagging strand synthesis, and HMCES prevents further slowing of the replication fork by translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases zeta (Polζ) and kappa (Polκ).

However, molecular mechanisms governing ER stress-induced ER-phagy remain insufficiently understood. Here we report that ER stress-induced ER-phagy in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires Epr1, a soluble Atg8-interacting ER-phagy receptor. Epr1 localizes to the ER through interacting with integral ER membrane proteins VAPs. Bridging an Atg8-VAP association is the main ER-phagy role of Epr1, as it can be bypassed by an artificial Atg8-VAP tether. VAPs contribute to ER-phagy not only by tethering Atg8 to the ER membrane, but also by maintaining the ER-plasma membrane contact. Epr1 is upregulated during ER stress by the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator Ire1. Loss of Epr1 reduces survival against ER stress. Conversely, increasing Epr1 expression suppresses the ER-phagy defect and ER stress sensitivity of cells lacking Ire1. Our findings expand and deepen the molecular understanding of ER-phagy."	0
"32208169"	"Immune-Microbiota Interplay and Colonization Resistance in Infection.Commensal microbial communities inhabit biological niches in the mammalian host, where they impact the host's physiology through induction of ""colonization resistance"" against infections by a multitude of molecular mechanisms. These colonization-regulating activities involve microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, which induce, through utilization of complex bacterial networks, competition over nutrients, inhibition by antimicrobial peptides, stimulation of the host immune system, and promotion of mucus and intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Distinct virulent pathogens overcome this colonization resistance and host immunity as part of a hostile takeover of the host niche, leading to clinically overt infection. The following review provides a mechanistic overview of the role of commensal microbes in modulating colonization resistance and pathogenic infections and means by which infectious agents may overcome such inhibition. Last, we outline evidence, unknowns, and challenges in developing strategies to harness this knowledge to treat infections by microbiota transfer, phage therapy, or supplementation by rationally defined bacterial consortia."	0
"31940479"	"Neuroinflammation-Associated Aspecific Manipulation of Mouse Predator Fear by Toxoplasma gondii.In rodents, the decrease of felid aversion induced by Toxoplasma gondii, a phenomenon termed fatal attraction, is interpreted as an adaptive manipulation by the neurotropic protozoan parasite. With the aim of understanding how the parasite induces such specific behavioral modifications, we performed a multiparametric analysis of T. gondii-induced changes on host behavior, physiology, and brain transcriptome as well as parasite cyst load and distribution. Using a set of complementary behavioral tests, we provide strong evidence that T. gondii lowers general anxiety in infected mice, increases explorative behaviors, and surprisingly alters predator aversion without selectivity toward felids. Furthermore, we show a positive correlation between the severity of the behavioral alterations and the cyst load, which indirectly reflects the level of inflammation during brain colonization. Taken together, these findings refute the myth of a selective loss of cat fear in T. gondii-infected mice and point toward widespread immune-related alterations of behaviors."	0
"32616654"	"The NADPH oxidase NOX4 promotes the directed migration of endothelial cells by stabilizing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 protein.Directed migration of endothelial cells (ECs) is an important process during both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. The binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) on the EC surface is necessary for directed migration of these cells. Here, we used TAXIScan, an optically accessible real-time horizontal cell dynamics assay approach, and demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which is abundantly expressed in ECs, mediates VEGF/VEGFR-2-dependent directed migration. We noted that a continuous supply of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained VEGFR-2 to the plasma membrane is required to maintain VEGFR-2 at the cell surface. siRNA-mediated NOX4 silencing decreased the ER-retained form of VEGFR-2, resulting in decreased cell surface expression levels of the receptor. We also found that ER-localized NOX4 interacts with ER-retained VEGFR-2 and thereby stabilizes this ER-retained form at the protein level in the ER. We conclude that NOX4 contributes to the directed migration of ECs by maintaining VEGFR-2 levels at their surface."	0
"32320651"	"Dissecting the Roles of Mitochondrial Complex I Intermediate Assembly Complex Factors in the Biogenesis of Complex I.Mitochondrial complex I harbors 7 mitochondrial and 38 nuclear-encoded subunits. Its biogenesis requires the assembly and integration of distinct intermediate modules, mediated by numerous assembly factors. The mitochondrial complex I intermediate assembly (MCIA) complex, containing assembly factors NDUFAF1, ECSIT, ACAD9, and TMEM126B, is required for building the intermediate ND2-module. The role of the MCIA complex and the involvement of other proteins in the biogenesis of this module is unclear. Cell knockout studies reveal that while each MCIA component is critical for complex I assembly, a hierarchy of stability exists centered on ACAD9. We also identify TMEM186 and COA1 as bona fide components of the MCIA complex with loss of either resulting in MCIA complex defects and reduced complex I assembly. TMEM186 enriches with newly translated ND3, and COA1 enriches with ND2. Our findings provide new functional insights into the essential nature of the MCIA complex in complex I assembly."	0

Dysregulation of these biomolecular interactions or malfunction of the associated enzymes results in various diseases; therefore, these interactions and enzymes are attractive targets for therapies. High-throughput screening can greatly facilitate the discovery of drugs for these targets. Here, we describe a biomolecular interaction detection method, called phase-separated <u>c</u>ondensate-aided <u>e</u>nrichment of <u>b</u>iomolecular <u>i</u>nteractions in <u>t</u>est tubes (CEBIT). The readout of CEBIT is the selective recruitment of biomolecules into phase-separated condensates harboring their cognate binding partners. We tailored CEBIT to detect various biomolecular interactions and activities of biomolecule-modifying enzymes. Using CEBIT-based high-throughput screening assays, we identified known inhibitors of the p53/MDM2 (MDM2) interaction and of the histone methyltransferase, suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), from a compound library. CEBIT is simple and versatile, and is likely to become a powerful tool for drug discovery and basic biomedical research."	0
"32755572"	"A Trio of Active Zone Proteins Comprised of RIM-BPs, RIMs, and Munc13s Governs Neurotransmitter Release.At the presynaptic active zone, action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release requires that fusion-competent synaptic vesicles are placed next to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The active zone resident proteins RIM, RBP, and Munc13 are essential contributors for vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel recruitment. Although the individual contributions of these scaffolds have been extensively studied, their respective functions in neurotransmission are still incompletely understood. Here, we analyze the functional interactions of RIMs, RBPs, and Munc13s at the genetic, molecular, functional, and ultrastructural levels in a mammalian synapse. We find that RBP, together with Munc13, promotes vesicle priming at the expense of RBP's role in recruiting presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, suggesting that the support of RBP for vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-secretion coupling is mutually exclusive. Our results demonstrate that the functional interaction of RIM, RBP, and Munc13 is more profound than previously envisioned, acting as a functional trio that govern basic and short-term plasticity properties of neurotransmission."	0
"32234472"	"Targeting the Extrinsic Pathway of Hepatocyte Apoptosis Promotes Clearance of Plasmodium Liver Infection.Plasmodium sporozoites infect the liver and develop into exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate blood-stage disease. The hepatocyte molecular pathways that permit or abrogate parasite replication and merozoite formation have not been thoroughly explored, and a deeper understanding may identify therapeutic strategies to mitigate malaria. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins regulate cell survival and are co-opted by intracellular pathogens to support development. Here, we show that cIAP1 levels are upregulated during Plasmodium liver infection and that genetic or pharmacological targeting of cIAPs using clinical-stage antagonists preferentially kills infected hepatocytes and promotes immunity. Using gene-targeted mice, the mechanism was defined as TNF-TNFR1-mediated apoptosis via caspases 3 and 8 to clear parasites. This study reveals the importance of cIAPs to Plasmodium infection and demonstrates that host-directed antimalarial drugs can eliminate liver parasites and induce immunity while likely providing a high barrier to resistance in the parasite."	0
"32726622"	"PTPN2 Deficiency Enhances Programmed T Cell Expansion and Survival Capacity of Activated T Cells.Manipulating molecules that impact T cell receptor (TCR) or cytokine signaling, such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), has significant potential for advancing T cell-based immunotherapies. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PTPN2 impacts the activation, survival, and memory formation of T cells. We find that PTPN2 deficiency renders cells in vivo and in vitro less dependent on survival-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins. Altogether, our data underline the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN2 in T cell-based therapies to augment the number and survival capacity of antigen-specific T cells."	0

"31226277"	"Structural Basis of an Asymmetric Condensin ATPase Cycle.The condensin protein complex plays a key role in the structural organization of genomes. How the ATPase activity of its SMC subunits drives large-scale changes in chromosome topology has remained unknown. Here we reconstruct, at near-atomic resolution, the sequence of events that take place during the condensin ATPase cycle. We show that ATP binding induces a conformational switch in the Smc4 head domain that releases its hitherto undescribed interaction with the Ycs4 HEAT-repeat subunit and promotes its engagement with the Smc2 head into an asymmetric heterodimer. SMC head dimerization subsequently enables nucleotide binding at the second active site and disengages the Brn1 kleisin subunit from the Smc2 coiled coil to open the condensin ring. These large-scale transitions in the condensin architecture lay out a mechanistic path for its ability to extrude DNA helices into large loop structures."	0
"32032531"	"Imprinted Maternally Expressed microRNAs Antagonize Paternally Driven Gene Programs in Neurons.Imprinted genes with parental-biased allelic expression are frequently co-regulated and enriched in common biological pathways. Here, we functionally characterize a large cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed from the maternally inherited allele (""maternally expressed"") to explore the molecular and cellular consequences of imprinted miRNA activity. Using an induced neuron (iN) culture system, we show that maternally expressed miRNAs from the miR-379/410 cluster direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to transcriptional and developmental regulators, including paternally expressed transcripts like Plagl1. Maternal deletion of this imprinted miRNA cluster resulted in increased protein levels of several targets and upregulation of a broader transcriptional program regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal function. A subset of the transcriptional changes resulting from miR-379/410 deletion can be attributed to de-repression of Plagl1. These data suggest maternally expressed miRNAs antagonize paternally driven gene programs in neurons."	0

"31883951"	"Molecular Wiring of a Mitochondrial Translational Feedback Loop.The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system comprises complexes assembled from subunits derived from mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression. Both genetic systems are coordinated by feedback loops, which control the synthesis of specific mitochondrial encoded subunits. Here, we studied how this occurs in the case of cytochrome b, a key subunit of mitochondrial complex III. Our data suggest the presence of a molecular rheostat consisting of two translational activators, Cbp3-Cbp6 and Cbs1, which operates at the mitoribosomal tunnel exit to connect translational output with assembly efficiency. When Cbp3-Cbp6 is engaged in assembly of cytochrome b, Cbs1 binds to the tunnel exit to sequester the cytochrome b-encoding mRNA, repressing its translation. After mediating complex III assembly, binding of Cbp3-Cbp6 to the tunnel exit replaces Cbs1 and the bound mRNA to permit cytochrome b synthesis. Collectively, the data indicate the molecular wiring of a feedback loop to regulate synthesis of a mitochondrial encoded protein."	0
"32234485"	"Endogenous Retroviral Envelope Syncytin Induces HIV-1 Spreading and Establishes HIV Reservoirs in Placenta.Radical cure of HIV-1 (HIV) is hampered by the establishment of HIV reservoirs and persistent infection in deep tissues despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we show that among HIV-positive women receiving suppressive ART, cells from placental tissues including trophoblasts contain HIV RNA and DNA. These viruses can be reactivated by latency reversal agents. We find that syncytin, the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus family W1 expressed on placental trophoblasts, triggers cell fusion with HIV-infected T cells. This results in cell-to-cell spread of HIV to placental trophoblasts. Such cell-to-cell spread of HIV is less sensitive to ART than free virus. Replication in syncytin-expressing cells can also produce syncytin-pseudotyped HIV, further expanding its ability to infect non-CD4 cells. These previously unrecognized mechanisms of HIV entry enable the virus to bypass receptor restriction to infect host barrier cells, thereby facilitating viral transmission and persistent infection in deep tissues."	0
"31629658"	"Distinct Roles for Condensin's Two ATPase Sites in Chromosome Condensation.Condensin is a conserved SMC complex that uses its ATPase machinery to structure genomes, but how it does so is largely unknown. We show that condensin's ATPase has a dual role in chromosome condensation. Mutation of one ATPase site impairs condensation, while mutating the second site results in hyperactive condensin that compacts DNA faster than wild-type, both in vivo and in vitro. Whereas one site drives loop formation, the second site is involved in the formation of more stable higher-order Z loop structures. Using hyperactive condensin I, we reveal that condensin II is not intrinsically needed for the shortening of mitotic chromosomes. Condensin II rather is required for a straight chromosomal axis and enables faithful chromosome segregation by counteracting the formation of ultrafine DNA bridges. SMC complexes with distinct roles for each ATPase site likely reflect a universal principle that enables these molecular machines to intricately control chromosome architecture."	0
"32719007"	"Characterization of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident peroxidases GPx7 and GPx8 shows the higher oxidative activity of GPx7 and its linkage to oxidative protein folding.Oxidative protein folding occurs primarily in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, enabled by a diverse network comprising more than 20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and more than five PDI oxidases. Although the canonical disulfide bond formation pathway involving Ero1α and PDI has been well-studied so far, the physiological roles of the newly identified PDI oxidases, glutathione peroxidase-7 (GPx7) and -8 (GPx8), are only poorly understood. We here demonstrated that human GPx7 has much higher reactivity with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and hence greater PDI oxidation activity than human GPx8. The high reactivity of GPx7 is due to the presence of a catalytic tetrad at the redox-active site, which stabilizes the sulfenylated species generated upon the reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Although it was previously postulated that GPx7 catalysis involved a highly reactive peroxidatic cysteine that can be sulfenylated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we revealed that a resolving cysteine instead regulates the PDI oxidation activity of GPx7. We also determined that GPx7 formed complexes preferentially with PDI and P5 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. Altogether, these results suggest that human GPx7 functions as an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent PDI oxidase in cells, whereas PDI oxidation may not be the central physiological role of human GPx8."	0
"32783931"	"Differential Histone Distribution Patterns in Induced Asymmetrically Dividing Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.Wnt3a-coated beads can induce asymmetric divisions of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), resulting in one self-renewed mESC and one differentiating epiblast stem cell. This provides an opportunity for studying histone inheritance pattern at a single-cell resolution in cell culture. Here, we report that mESCs with Wnt3a-bead induction display nonoverlapping preexisting (old) versus newly synthesized (new) histone H3 patterns, but mESCs without Wnt3a beads have largely overlapping patterns. Furthermore, H4K20me2/3, an old histone-enriched modification, displays a higher instance of asymmetric distribution on chromatin fibers from Wnt3a-induced mESCs than those from non-induced mESCs. These locally distinct distributions between old and new histones have both cellular specificity in Wnt3a-induced mESCs and molecular specificity for histones H3 and H4. Given that post-translational modifications at H3 and H4 carry the major histone modifications, our findings provide a mammalian cell culture system to study histone inheritance for maintaining stem cell fate and for resetting it during differentiation."	0
"32268105"	"Integration of Nodal and BMP Signaling by Mutual Signaling Effector Antagonism.Opposing sources of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Nodal signaling molecules are sufficient to induce the formation of a full axis in zebrafish embryos. To address how these signals orchestrate patterning, we transplant sources of fluorescently tagged Nodal and BMP into zebrafish embryos, robustly inducing the formation of secondary axes. Nodal and BMP signal non-cell-autonomously and form similar protein gradients in this context, but the signaling range of Nodal (pSmad2) is shorter than the BMP range (pSmad5). This yields a localized region of pSmad2 activity around the Nodal source, overlapping with a broad domain of pSmad5 activity across the embryo. Cell fates induced in various regions stereotypically correlate with pSmad2-to-pSmad5 ratios and can even be induced BMP- and Nodal-independently with different ratios of constitutively active Smad2 and Smad5. Strikingly, we find that Smad2 and Smad5 antagonize each other for specific cell fates, providing a mechanism for how cells integrate and discriminate between overlapping signals during development."	0
"31896690"	"Genomic imprinting in plants-revisiting existing models.Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon leading to parentally biased gene expression. Throughout the years, extensive efforts have been made to characterize the epigenetic marks underlying imprinting in animals and plants. As a result, DNA methylation asymmetries between parental genomes emerged as the primary factor controlling the imprinting status of many genes. Nevertheless, the data accumulated so far suggest that this process cannot solely explain the imprinting of all genes. In this review, we revisit the current models explaining imprinting regulation in plants, and discuss novel regulatory mechanisms that could function independently of parental DNA methylation asymmetries in the establishment of imprinting."	0

TM7x was the only cultivated member of the candidate phyla radiation (CPR), estimated to encompass 26% of the domain Bacteria. Here we report on divergent genomes from major lineages across the Saccharibacteria phylum in humans and mammals, as well as from ancient dental calculus. These lineages are present at high prevalence within hosts. Direct imaging reveals that all groups are ultra-small in size, likely feeding off commensal bacteria. Analyses suggest that multiple acquisition events in the past led to the current wide diversity, with convergent evolution of key functions allowing Saccharibacteria from the environment to adapt to mammals. Ultra-small, parasitic CPR bacteria represent a relatively unexplored paradigm of prokaryotic interactions within mammalian microbiomes."	0
"30639240"	"Mechanistic Insights into the cis- and trans-Acting DNase Activities of Cas12a.CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) is an RNA-guided DNA-cutting nuclease that has been repurposed for genome editing. Upon target DNA binding, Cas12a cleaves both the target DNA in cis and non-target single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in trans. To elucidate the molecular basis for both DNase cleavage modes, we performed structural and biochemical studies on Francisella novicida Cas12a. We show that guide RNA-target strand DNA hybridization conformationally activates Cas12a, triggering its trans-acting, non-specific, single-stranded DNase activity. In turn, cis cleavage of double-stranded DNA targets is a result of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent DNA duplex unwinding, electrostatic stabilization of the displaced non-target DNA strand, and ordered sequential cleavage of the non-target and target DNA strands. Cas12a releases the PAM-distal DNA cleavage product and remains bound to the PAM-proximal DNA cleavage product in a catalytically competent, trans-active state. Together, these results provide a revised model for the molecular mechanisms of both the cis- and the trans-acting DNase activities of Cas12a enzymes, enabling their further exploitation as genome editing tools."	0
"31968255"	"Multi-lineage Lung Regeneration by Stem Cell Transplantation across Major Genetic Barriers.Induction of lung regeneration by transplantation of lung progenitor cells is a critical preclinical challenge.

However, overcoming MHC barriers is an additional requirement for clinical application of this attractive approach. We demonstrate here that durable tolerance toward mis-matched lung progenitors and their derivatives can be achieved without any chronic immune suppression, by virtue of co-transplantation with hematopoietic progenitors from the same donor. Initial proof of concept of this approach was attained by transplantation of fetal lung cells comprising both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, an even higher rate of blood and epithelial lung chimerism was attained by using adult lung cells supplemented with bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. These results lay the foundation for repair of lung injury through a procedure akin to bone marrow transplantation."	0
"32579929"	"Enhancer RNAs Mediate Estrogen-Induced Decommissioning of Selective Enhancers by Recruiting ERα and Its Cofactor.The function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. By analyzing the genome-wide nascent transcript profiles in breast cancer cells, we identify a special group of eRNAs that are essential for estrogen-induced transcriptional repression. Using eRNAs of TM4SF1 and EFEMP1 as the paradigms, we find that these RNA molecules not only stabilize promoter-enhancer interactions but also recruit liganded estrogen receptor α (ERα) to particular enhancer regions, facilitate the formation of a functional transcriptional complex, and cause gene silencing. Interestingly, ERα is shown to directly bind with eRNAs by its DNA-binding domain. These eRNAs help with the formation of a specific ERα-centered transcriptional complex and promote the association of the histone demethylase KDM2A, which dismisses RNA polymerase II from designated enhancers and suppresses the transcription of target genes. Our work demonstrates a complete mechanism underlying the action of eRNAs in modulating and refining the locus-specific transcriptional program."	0
"32130910"	"Direct Comparison of Mononucleated and Binucleated Cardiomyocytes Reveals Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Distinct Proliferative Competencies.The mammalian heart is incapable of regenerating a sufficient number of cardiomyocytes to ameliorate the loss of contractile muscle after acute myocardial injury. Several reports have demonstrated that mononucleated cardiomyocytes are more responsive than are binucleated cardiomyocytes to pro-proliferative stimuli. We have developed a strategy to isolate and characterize highly enriched populations of mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes at various times of development. Our results suggest that an E2f/Rb transcriptional network is central to the divergence of these two populations and that remnants of the differences acquired during the neonatal period remain in adult cardiomyocytes. Moreover, inducing binucleation by genetically blocking the ability of cardiomyocytes to complete cytokinesis leads to a reduction in E2f target gene expression, directly linking the E2f pathway with nucleation. These data identify key molecular differences between mononucleated and binucleated mammalian cardiomyocytes that can be used to leverage cardiomyocyte proliferation for promoting injury repair in the heart."	0
"32049001"	"NAD<sup>+</sup> Repletion Rescues Female Fertility during Reproductive Aging.Reproductive aging in female mammals is an irreversible process associated with declining oocyte quality, which is the rate-limiting factor to fertility. Here, we show that this loss of oocyte quality with age accompanies declining levels of the prominent metabolic cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>). Treatment with the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) rejuvenates oocyte quality in aged animals, leading to restoration in fertility, and this can be recapitulated by transgenic overexpression of the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacylase SIRT2, though deletion of this enzyme does not impair oocyte quality. These benefits of NMN extend to the developing embryo, where supplementation reverses the adverse effect of maternal age on developmental milestones. These findings suggest that late-life restoration of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels represents an opportunity to rescue female reproductive function in mammals."	0

We identify an excitatory synaptic projection from the presubiculum (PreS) and the multisensory-associative retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to the anterodorsal thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), so far classically implied in gating sensory information flow. In vitro, projections to TRN involve AMPA/NMDA-type glutamate receptors that initiate TRN cell burst discharge and feedforward inhibition of anterior thalamic nuclei. In vivo, chemogenetic anterodorsal TRN inhibition modulates PreS/RSC-induced anterior thalamic firing dynamics, broadens the tuning of thalamic HD cells, and leads to preferential use of allo- over egocentric search strategies in the Morris water maze. TRN-dependent thalamic inhibition is thus an integral part of limbic navigational circuits wherein it coordinates external sensory and internal HD signals to regulate the choice of search strategies during spatial navigation."	0

B-compartment chromatin is physically separated from the A compartment and compacted by the nuclear lamina. To examine these models in the developmental context of C. elegans embryogenesis, we undertook chromosome tracing to map the trajectories of entire autosomes. Early embryonic chromosomes organized into an unconventional barbell-like configuration, with two densely folded B compartments separated by a central A compartment. Upon gastrulation, this conformation matured into conventional A/B compartments. We used unsupervised clustering to uncover subpopulations with differing folding properties and variable positioning of compartment boundaries. These conformations relied on tethering to the lamina to stretch the chromosome; detachment from the lamina compacted, and allowed intermingling between, A/B compartments. These findings reveal the diverse conformations of early embryonic chromosomes and uncover a previously unappreciated role for the lamina in systemic chromosome stretching."	0
"32130909"	"Transmembrane Coordination of Preprotein Recognition and Motor Coupling by the Mitochondrial Presequence Receptor Tim50.Mitochondrial preproteins contain amino-terminal presequences directing them to the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23 complex). Depending on additional downstream import signals, TIM23 either inserts preproteins into the inner membrane or translocates them into the matrix. Matrix import requires the coupling of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) to TIM23. The molecular mechanisms coordinating preprotein recognition by TIM23 in the intermembrane space (IMS) with PAM activation in the matrix are unknown. Here we show that subsequent to presequence recognition in the IMS, the Tim50 matrix domain facilitates the recruitment of the coupling factor Pam17. Next, the IMS domain of Tim50 promotes PAM recruitment to TIM23. Finally, the Tim50 transmembrane segment stimulates the matrix-directed import-driving force exerted by PAM. We propose that recognition of preprotein segments in the IMS and transfer of signal information across the inner membrane by Tim50 determine import motor activation."	0

However, how cellular proteins facilitate L1 retrotransposition requires elucidation. Here, we demonstrate that single-strand DNA breaks induced by the L1 endonuclease trigger the recruitment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP2) to L1 integration sites and that PARP2 activation leads to the subsequent recruitment of the replication protein A (RPA) complex to facilitate retrotransposition. We further demonstrate that RPA directly binds activated PARP2 through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and can protect single-strand L1 integration intermediates from APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination in vitro. Paradoxically, we provide evidence that RPA can guide APOBEC3A, and perhaps other APOBEC3 proteins, to sites of L1 integration. Thus, the interplay of L1-encoded and evolutionarily conserved cellular proteins is required for efficient retrotransposition; however, these interactions also may be exploited to restrict L1 retrotransposition in the human genome."	0

Here, we take a systematic approach to compare the single-cell transcriptomes of various human cortical brain organoids together with fetal brain to define the identity of specific cell types and differentiation routes in each method. Importantly, we identify unique developmental programs in each protocol compared to fetal brain, which will be a critical benchmark for the utility of human brain organoids in the future."	0
"31968260"	"Structural Insights into the Unique Activation Mechanisms of a Non-classical Calpain and Its Disease-Causing Variants.Increased calpain activity is linked to neuroinflammation including a heritable retinal disease caused by hyper-activating mutations in the calcium-activated calpain-5 (CAPN5) protease. Although structures for classical calpains are known, the structure of CAPN5, a non-classical calpain, remains undetermined. Here we report the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the human CAPN5 protease core (CAPN5-PC). Compared to classical calpains, CAPN5-PC requires high calcium concentrations for maximal activity. Structure-based phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment reveal that CAPN5-PC contains three elongated flexible loops compared to its classical counterparts. The presence of a disease-causing mutation (c.799G>A, p.Gly267Ser) on the unique PC2L2 loop reveals a function in this region for regulating enzymatic activity. This mechanism could be transferred to distant calpains, using synthetic calpain hybrids, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism for fine-tuning calpain function by modifying flexible loops. Further, the open (inactive) conformation of CAPN5-PC provides structural insight into CAPN5-specific residues that can guide inhibitor design."	0
"32268087"	"Gut Microbiota Modulate CD8 T Cell Responses to Influence Colitis-Associated Tumorigenesis.There is increasing evidence that gut microbiome perturbations, also known as dysbiosis, can influence colorectal cancer development. To understand the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates cancer susceptibility, we examine two wild-type mouse colonies with distinct gut microbial communities that develop significantly different tumor numbers using a mouse model of inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that adaptive immune cells contribute to the different tumor susceptibilities associated with the two microbial communities. Mice that develop more tumors have increased colon lamina propria CD8<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells before tumorigenesis but reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumors and adjacent tissues compared with mice that develop fewer tumors. Notably, intratumoral T cells in mice that develop more tumors exhibit increased exhaustion. Thus, these studies suggest that microbial dysbiosis can contribute to colon tumor susceptibility by hyperstimulating CD8 T cells to promote chronic inflammation and early T cell exhaustion, which can reduce anti-tumor immunity."	0
"31398323"	"Enhancer Features that Drive Formation of Transcriptional Condensates.Enhancers are DNA elements that are bound by transcription factors (TFs), which recruit coactivators and the transcriptional machinery to genes. Phase-separated condensates of TFs and coactivators have been implicated in assembling the transcription machinery at particular enhancers, yet the role of DNA sequence in this process has not been explored. We show that DNA sequences encoding TF binding site number, density, and affinity above sharply defined thresholds drive condensation of TFs and coactivators. A combination of specific structured (TF-DNA) and weak multivalent (TF-coactivator) interactions allows for condensates to form at particular genomic loci determined by the DNA sequence and the complement of expressed TFs. DNA features found to drive condensation promote enhancer activity and transcription in cells. Our study provides a framework to understand how the genome can scaffold transcriptional condensates at specific loci and how the universal phenomenon of phase separation might regulate this process."	0
"32035036"	"Dopamine Uses the DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A Signaling Axis to Block the TRAF6-Mediated NF-κB Pathway and Suppress Systemic Inflammation.The functional relevance and mechanistic basis of the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) on inflammation remain unclear. Here we reveal that DA inhibited TLR2-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation via the DRD5 receptor in macrophages. We found that the DRD5 receptor, via the EFD and IYX(X)I/L motifs in its CT and IC3 loop, respectively, can directly recruit TRAF6 and its negative regulator ARRB2 to form a multi-protein complex also containing downstream signaling proteins, such as TAK1, IKKs, and PP2A, that impairs TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-κB and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the DA-DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A signaling axis can prevent S. aureus-induced inflammation and protect mice against S. aureus-induced sepsis and meningitis after DA treatment. Collectively, these findings provide the first demonstration of DA-DRD5 signaling acting to control inflammation and a detailed delineation of the underlying mechanism and identify the DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A axis as a potential target for future therapy of inflammation-associated diseases such as meningitis and sepsis."	1
"32268102"	"Periostin Activation of Integrin Receptors on Sensory Neurons Induces Allergic Itch.Chronic allergic itch is a common symptom affecting millions of people and animals, but its pathogenesis is not fully explained. Herein, we show that periostin, abundantly expressed in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), induces itch in mice, dogs, and monkeys. We identify the integrin α<sub>V</sub>β3 expressed on a subset of sensory neurons as the periostin receptor. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we inhibited the function of neuronal integrin α<sub>V</sub>β3, which significantly reduces periostin-induced itch in mice. Furthermore, we show that the cytokine TSLP, the application of AD-causing MC903 (calcipotriol), and house dust mites all induce periostin secretion. Finally, we establish that the JAK/STAT pathway is a key regulator of periostin secretion in keratinocytes. Altogether, our results identify a TSLP-periostin reciprocal activation loop that links the skin to the spinal cord via peripheral sensory neurons, and we characterize the non-canonical functional role of an integrin in itch."	0
"32017898"	"The Alazami Syndrome-Associated Protein LARP7 Guides U6 Small Nuclear RNA Modification and Contributes to Splicing Robustness.The La-related protein 7 (LARP7) forms a complex with the nuclear 7SK RNA to regulate RNA polymerase II transcription. It has been implicated in cancer and the Alazami syndrome, a severe developmental disorder. Here, we report a so far unknown role of this protein in RNA modification. We show that LARP7 physically connects the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) with a distinct subset of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guiding U6 2'-O-methylation. Consistently, these modifications are severely compromised in the absence of LARP7. Although general splicing remains largely unaffected, transcriptome-wide analysis revealed perturbations in alternative splicing in LARP7-depleted cells. Importantly, we identified defects in 2'-O-methylation of the U6 snRNA in Alazami syndrome siblings carrying a LARP7 mutation. Our data identify LARP7 as a bridging factor for snoRNA-guided modification of the U6 snRNA and suggest that alterations in splicing fidelity contribute to the etiology of the Alazami syndrome."	1
"32375055"	"GDE2-Dependent Activation of Canonical Wnt Signaling in Neurons Regulates Oligodendrocyte Maturation.Neurons and oligodendrocytes communicate to regulate oligodendrocyte development and ensure appropriate axonal myelination. Here, we show that Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2) signaling underlies a neuronal pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation through the release of soluble neuronally derived factors. Mice lacking global or neuronal GDE2 expression have reduced mature oligodendrocytes and myelin proteins but retain normal numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Wild-type (WT) OPCs cultured in conditioned medium (CM) from Gde2-null (Gde2KO) neurons exhibit delayed maturation, recapitulating in vivo phenotypes. Gde2KO neurons show robust reduction in canonical Wnt signaling, and genetic activation of Wnt signaling in Gde2KO neurons rescues in vivo and in vitro oligodendrocyte maturation. Phosphacan, a known stimulant of oligodendrocyte maturation, is reduced in CM from Gde2KO neurons but is restored when Wnt signaling is activated. These studies identify GDE2 control of Wnt signaling as a neuronal pathway that signals to oligodendroglia to promote oligodendrocyte maturation."	0
"32780989"	"GIT/PIX Condensates Are Modular and Ideal for Distinct Compartmentalized Cell Signaling.Enzymes or enzyme complexes can be concentrated in different cellular loci to modulate distinct functional processes in response to specific signals. How cells condense and compartmentalize enzyme complexes for spatiotemporally distinct cellular events is not well understood. Here we discover that specific and tight association of GIT1 and β-Pix, a pair of GTPase regulatory enzymes, leads to phase separation of the complex without additional scaffolding molecules. GIT1/β-Pix condensates are modular in nature and can be positioned at distinct cellular compartments, such as neuronal synapses, focal adhesions, and cell-cell junctions, by upstream adaptors. Guided by the structure of the GIT/PIX complex, we specifically probed the role of phase separation of the enzyme complex in cell migration and synapse formation. Our study suggests that formation of modular enzyme complex condensates via phase separation can dynamically concentrate limited quantities of enzymes to distinct cellular compartments for specific and optimal signaling."	1

Here, we demonstrate non-overlapping behavioral differences associated with distinct abnormalities in hippocampal and mPFC electrophysiology during a canonical spatial working memory task in three partially trisomic mouse models of DS (Dp1Tyb, Dp10Yey, and Dp17Yey) that together cover all regions of homology with human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Dp1Tyb mice show slower decision-making (unrelated to the gene dose of DYRK1A, which has been implicated in DS cognitive dysfunction) and altered theta dynamics (reduced frequency, increased hippocampal-mPFC coherence, and increased modulation of hippocampal high gamma); Dp10Yey mice show impaired alternation performance and reduced theta modulation of hippocampal low gamma; and Dp17Yey mice are not significantly different from the wild type. These results link specific hippocampal and mPFC circuit dysfunctions to cognitive deficits in DS models and, importantly, map them to discrete regions of Hsa21."	0
"31995731"	"Protein Turnover in Epithelial Cells and Mucus along the Gastrointestinal Tract Is Coordinated by the Spatial Location and Microbiota.The gastrointestinal tract is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that, together with the mucus layers, protect the underlying tissue from microbial invasion. The epithelium has one of the highest turnover rates in the body. Using stable isotope labeling, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and computational analysis, we report a comprehensive dataset of the turnover of more than 3,000 and the expression of more than 5,000 intestinal epithelial cell proteins, analyzed under conventional and germ-free conditions across five different segments in mouse intestine. The median protein half-life is shorter in the small intestine than in the colon. Differences in protein turnover rates along the intestinal tract can be explained by distinct physiological and immune-related functions between the small and large intestine. An absence of microbiota results in an approximately 1 day longer protein half-life in germ-free animals."	0
"30661980"	"An Isoprene Lipid-Binding Protein Promotes Eukaryotic Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis.The biosynthesis of coenzyme Q presents a paradigm for how cells surmount hydrophobic barriers in lipid biology. In eukaryotes, CoQ precursors-among nature's most hydrophobic molecules-must somehow be presented to a series of enzymes peripherally associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we reveal that this process relies on custom lipid-binding properties of COQ9. We show that COQ9 repurposes the bacterial TetR fold to bind aromatic isoprenes with high specificity, including CoQ intermediates that likely reside entirely within the bilayer. We reveal a process by which COQ9 associates with cardiolipin-rich membranes and warps the membrane surface to access this cargo. Finally, we identify a molecular interface between COQ9 and the hydroxylase COQ7, motivating a model whereby COQ9 presents intermediates directly to CoQ enzymes. Overall, our results provide a mechanism for how a lipid-binding protein might access, select, and deliver specific cargo from a membrane to promote biosynthesis."	0
"32937118"	"The Dorsal Lateral Habenula-Interpeduncular Nucleus Pathway Is Essential for Left-Right-Dependent Decision Making in Zebrafish.How animals behave using suitable information to adapt to the environment is not well known. We address this issue by devising an automated system to let zebrafish exploit either internal (choice of left or right turn) or external (choice of cue color) navigation information to achieve operant behavior by reward reinforcement learning. The results of behavioral task with repeated rule shift indicate that zebrafish can learn operant behavior using both internal-directional and external-cued information. The learning time is reduced as rule shifts are repeated, revealing the capacity of zebrafish to adaptively retrieve the suitable rule memory after training. Zebrafish with an impairment in the neural pathway from the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus, known to be potentiated in the winners of social conflicts, show specific defects in the application of the internal-directional rule, suggesting the dual roles of this pathway."	0
"31999954"	"Autism-Misregulated eIF4G Microexons Control Synaptic Translation and Higher Order Cognitive Functions.Microexons represent the most highly conserved class of alternative splicing, yet their functions are poorly understood. Here, we focus on closely related neuronal microexons overlapping prion-like domains in the translation initiation factors, eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, the splicing of which is activity dependent and frequently disrupted in autism. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of these microexons selectively upregulates synaptic proteins that control neuronal activity and plasticity and further triggers a gene expression program mirroring that of activated neurons. Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning, and memory deficits, accompanied by altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We provide evidence that the eIF4G microexons function as a translational brake by causing ribosome stalling, through their propensity to promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP. The results thus reveal an autism-disrupted mechanism by which alternative splicing specializes neuronal translation to control higher order cognitive functioning."	0
"32521259"	"Computationally Guided Intracerebral Drug Delivery via Chronically Implanted Microdevices.Treatments for neurologic diseases are often limited in efficacy due to poor spatial and temporal control over their delivery. Intracerebral delivery partially overcomes this by directly infusing therapeutics to the brain. Brain structures, however, are nonuniform and irregularly shaped, precluding complete target coverage by a single bolus without significant off-target effects and possible toxicity. Nearly complete coverage is crucial for effective modulation of these structures. We present a framework with computational mapping algorithms for neural drug delivery (COMMAND) to guide multi-bolus targeting of brain structures that maximizes coverage and minimizes off-target leakage. Custom-fabricated chronic neural implants leverage rational fluidic design to achieve multi-bolus delivery in rodents through a single infusion of radioactive tracer (Cu-64). The resulting spatial distributions replicate computed spatial coverage with 5% error in vivo, as detected by positron emission tomography. COMMAND potentially enables accurate, efficacious targeting of discrete brain regions."	0
"31999955"	"ATAC-Me Captures Prolonged DNA Methylation of Dynamic Chromatin Accessibility Loci during Cell Fate Transitions.DNA methylation of enhancers is dynamic, cell-type specific, and vital for cell fate progression. However, current models inadequately define its role within the hierarchy of gene regulation. Analysis of independent datasets shows an unanticipated overlap between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at enhancers of steady-state stem cells, suggesting that these two opposing features might exist concurrently. To define their temporal relationship, we developed ATAC-Me, which probes accessibility and methylation from single DNA library preparations. We identified waves of accessibility occurring rapidly across thousands of myeloid enhancers in a monocyte-to-macrophage cell fate model. Prolonged methylation states were observed at a majority of these sites, while transcription of nearby genes tracked closely with accessibility. ATAC-Me uncovers a significant disconnect between chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation status, and gene activity. This unexpected observation highlights the value of ATAC-Me in constructing precise molecular timelines for understanding the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation."	0
"31761494"	"RNA-RNA Interactomes of ProQ and Hfq Reveal Overlapping and Competing Roles.Base pairing RNAs modulate gene expression in all studied organisms. In many bacteria, the base pairing between most small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and their targets is mediated by the Hfq RNA chaperone. However, recent studies have shown FinO-domain proteins also bind sRNAs. To examine the global contribution of the FinO-domain ProQ protein in Escherichia coli, we carried out RIL-seq to identify RNA pairs bound to this protein. The RNA-RNA interactome for ProQ contains hundreds of pairs. Intriguingly, a significant fraction of the ProQ-bound RNA pairs are also found associated with Hfq, indicating overlapping, complementary, or competing roles for the two proteins. Characterization of one novel RNA pair bound by both chaperones revealed that while Hfq is required for RNA sponge-mediated downregulation of the sRNA, ProQ can inhibit this regulation. Overall, our results uncover increased complexity in RNA regulatory networks involving RNA chaperone proteins, RNases, sRNAs, and mRNAs."	0
"30661982"	"Light Regulates Plant Alternative Splicing through the Control of Transcriptional Elongation.Light makes carbon fixation possible, allowing plant and animal life on Earth. We have previously shown that light regulates alternative splicing in plants. Light initiates a chloroplast retrograde signaling that regulates nuclear alternative splicing of a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana transcripts. Here, we show that light promotes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation in the affected genes, whereas in darkness, elongation is lower. These changes in transcription are consistent with elongation causing the observed changes in alternative splicing, as revealed by different drug treatments and genetic evidence. The light control of splicing and elongation is abolished in an Arabidopsis mutant defective in the transcription factor IIS (TFIIS). We report that the chloroplast control of nuclear alternative splicing in plants responds to the kinetic coupling mechanism found in mammalian cells, providing unique evidence that coupling is important for a whole organism to respond to environmental cues."	0

Here, we describe the near-atomic-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex consisting of the nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and suggests a mechanism of activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 toward humans with a relatively lower body temperature than the natural bat hosts."	1
"32234477"	"Brain Endothelial Cells Are Exquisite Sensors of Age-Related Circulatory Cues.Brain endothelial cells (BECs) are key constituents of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protecting the brain from pathogens and restricting access of circulatory factors. Yet, because circulatory proteins have prominent age-related effects on adult neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function in mice, we wondered whether BECs receive and potentially relay signals between the blood and brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal BECs, we discover that capillary BECs-compared with arterial and venous BECs-undergo the greatest transcriptional changes in normal aging, upregulating innate immunity and oxidative stress response pathways. Short-term infusions of aged plasma into young mice recapitulate key aspects of this aging transcriptome, and remarkably, infusions of young plasma into aged mice exert rejuvenation effects on the capillary transcriptome. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional age of BECs is exquisitely sensitive to age-related circulatory cues and pinpoint the BBB itself as a promising therapeutic target to treat brain disease."	0

Participants took a nap before and after playing a neurally controlled sequence-copying game that consists of many repetitions of one ""repeated"" sequence sparsely interleaved with varying ""control"" sequences. Both participants performed repeated sequences more accurately than control sequences, consistent with learning. We compare the firing rate patterns that caused the cursor movements when performing each sequence to firing rate patterns throughout both rest periods. Correlations with repeated sequences increase more from pre- to post-task rest than do correlations with control sequences, providing direct evidence of learning-related replay in the human brain."	0
"32640229"	"Distinct Mechanisms of Over-Representation of Landmarks and Rewards in the Hippocampus.In the hippocampus, locations associated with salient features are represented by a disproportionately large number of neurons, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this over-representation remain elusive. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in mice learning to navigate in virtual reality, we find that the over-representation of reward and landmark locations are mediated by persistent and separable subsets of neurons, with distinct time courses of emergence and differing underlying molecular mechanisms. Strikingly, we find that in mice lacking Shank2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene encoding an excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein, the learning-induced over-representation of landmarks was absent whereas the over-representation of rewards was substantially increased, as was goal-directed behavior. These findings demonstrate that multiple hippocampal coding processes for unique types of salient features are distinguished by a Shank2-dependent mechanism and suggest that abnormally distorted hippocampal salience mapping may underlie cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in a subset of ASDs."	0

Using global nuclear run-on followed by sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), we show that CDK8 kinase activity promotes RNA polymerase II pause release in response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a universal cytokine involved in immunity and tumor surveillance. The Mediator kinase module contains CDK8 or CDK19, which are presumed to be functionally redundant. We implemented cortistatin A, chemical genetics, transcriptomics, and other methods to decouple their function while assessing enzymatic versus structural roles. Unexpectedly, CDK8 and CDK19 regulated different gene sets via distinct mechanisms. CDK8-dependent regulation required its kinase activity, whereas CDK19 governed IFN-γ responses through its scaffolding function (i.e., it was kinase independent). Accordingly, CDK8, not CDK19, phosphorylates the STAT1 transcription factor (TF) during IFN-γ stimulation, and CDK8 kinase inhibition blocked activation of JAK-STAT pathway TFs. Cytokines such as IFN-γ rapidly mobilize TFs to ""reprogram"" cellular transcription; our results implicate CDK8 and CDK19 as essential for this transcriptional reprogramming."	1

Although SV endocytosis is a rate-limiting step for synaptic transmission, it is unclear whether the rate of the subsequent SV refilling with neurotransmitter also influences synaptic transmission. By analyzing vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1)-deficient calyx of Held synapses, in which both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are co-expressed in wild-type situation, we found that VGLUT1 loss causes a drastic reduction in SV refilling rate down to ∼25% of wild-type values, with only subtle changes in basic synaptic parameters. Strikingly, VGLUT1-deficient synapses exhibited abnormal synaptic failures within a few seconds during high-frequency repetitive firing, which was recapitulated by manipulating presynaptic Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations to retard SV refilling.

"31940487"	"Hippocampal Ripple Coordinates Retrosplenial Inhibitory Neurons during Slow-Wave Sleep.The hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) play indispensable roles in memory formation, and importantly, a hippocampal oscillation known as ripple is key to consolidation of new memories. However, it remains unclear how the hippocampus and RSC communicate and the role of ripple oscillation in coordinating the activity between these two brain regions. Here, we record from the dorsal hippocampus and RSC simultaneously in freely behaving mice during sleep and reveal that the RSC displays a pre-ripple activation associated with slow and fast oscillations. Immediately after ripples, a subpopulation of RSC putative inhibitory neurons increases firing activity, while most RSC putative excitatory neurons decrease activity. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of this hippocampus-RSC pathway activates and suppresses RSC putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively.

Metazoan CTDs have well-conserved lengths and sequence compositions arising from the evolution of divergent motifs, features thought to be essential for development. On the contrary, we show that a truncated CTD composed solely of YSPTSPS repeats supports Drosophila viability but that a CTD with enough YSPTSPS repeats to match the length of the wild-type Drosophila CTD is defective. Furthermore, a fluorescently tagged CTD lacking the rest of Pol II dynamically enters transcription compartments, indicating that the CTD functions as a signal sequence. However, CTDs with too many YSPTSPS repeats are more prone to localize to static nuclear foci separate from the chromosomes. We propose that the sequence complexity of the CTD offsets aberrant behavior caused by excessive repetitive sequences without compromising its targeting function."	0

The Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase cascade plays a major role in triacylglycerol synthesis and in the regulation of phospholipid synthesis. In this work, we examined Spo7, a regulatory subunit required for Nem1 catalytic function, to identify residues that govern formation of the Nem1-Spo7 complex. By deletion analysis of Spo7, we identified a hydrophobic Leu-Leu-Ile (LLI) sequence comprising residues 54-56 as being required for the protein to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of an <i>spo7</i>Δ mutant strain.

The strategy involves synthetic recoding of viral genomes that alters the positions of synonymous codons, thereby increasing the number of suboptimal codon pairs and CpG dinucleotides in recoded genomes. Here we identify the molecular mechanism of codon pair deoptimization-based attenuation by studying recoded influenza A viruses. We show that suboptimal codon pairs cause attenuation, whereas the increase of CpG dinucleotides has no effect. Furthermore, we show that suboptimal codon pairs reduce both mRNA stability and translation efficiency of codon pair-deoptimized genes. Consequently, reduced protein production directly causes virus attenuation. Our study provides evidence that suboptimal codon pairs are major determinants of mRNA stability.

Here, we reveal rhythmic genome-wide alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs encoding regulators of peptidergic secretion within pancreatic β cells that are perturbed in <i>Clock</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> β-cell lines. We show that the RNA-binding protein THRAP3 (thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3) regulates circadian clock-dependent AS by binding to exons at coding sequences flanking exons that are more frequently skipped in clock mutant β cells, including transcripts encoding <i>Cask</i> (<i>calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase</i>) and <i>Madd</i> (<i>MAP kinase-activating death domain</i>). Depletion of THRAP3 restores expression of the long isoforms of <i>Cask</i> and <i>Madd</i>, and mimicking exon skipping in these transcripts through antisense oligonucleotide delivery in wild-type islets reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Finally, we identify shared networks of alternatively spliced exocytic genes from islets of rodent models of diet-induced obesity that significantly overlap with clock mutants. Our results establish a role for pre-mRNA alternative splicing in β-cell function across the sleep/wake cycle."	0
"32763226"	"Primary Role of the Nucleosome.Whereas the core nucleosome is thought to serve as a packaging device for the coiling and contraction in length of genomic DNA, we suggest that it serves primarily in the regulation of transcription. A nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription. The association of nucleosomes with most genomic DNA prevents initiation from cryptic promoters. The nucleosome thus serves not only as a general gene repressor, but also as a repressor of all transcription (genic, intragenic, and intergenic). The core nucleosome performs a fundamental regulatory role, apart from the histone ""tails,"" which modulate gene activity."	0

"31914386"	"Timely Inhibitory Circuit Formation Controlled by Abl1 Regulates Innate Olfactory Behaviors in Mouse.More than one-half of the interneurons in a mouse olfactory bulb (OB) develop during the first week after birth and predominantly connect to excitatory tufted cells near the superficial granule cell layer (sGCL), unlike late-born interneurons. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the temporal specification are yet to be identified. In this study, we determined the role of Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1 (Abl1) in the temporal development of early-born OB interneurons. Lentiviral knockdown of Abl1 disrupts the sGCL circuit of early-born interneurons through defects in function and circuit integration, resulting in olfactory hyper-sensitivity. We show that doublecortin (Dcx) is phosphorylated by Abl1, which contributes to the stabilization of Dcx, thereby regulating microtubule dynamics. Finally, Dcx overexpression rescues Abl1 knockdown-induced anatomic or functional defects. In summary, specific signaling by Abl1-Dcx in early-born interneurons facilitates the temporal development of the sGCL circuit to regulate innate olfactory functions, such as detection and sensitivity."	0
"32320658"	"m.3243A > G-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction Impairs Human Neuronal Development and Reduces Neuronal Network Activity and Synchronicity.Epilepsy, intellectual and cortical sensory deficits, and psychiatric manifestations are the most frequent manifestations of mitochondrial diseases. How mitochondrial dysfunction affects neural structure and function remains elusive, mostly because of a lack of proper in vitro neuronal model systems with mitochondrial dysfunction. Leveraging induced pluripotent stem cell technology, we differentiated excitatory cortical neurons (iNeurons) with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function on an isogenic nuclear DNA background from patients with the common pathogenic m.3243A > G variant of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). iNeurons with high heteroplasmy exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, delayed neural maturation, reduced dendritic complexity, and fewer excitatory synapses. Micro-electrode array recordings of neuronal networks displayed reduced network activity and decreased synchronous network bursting. Impaired neuronal energy metabolism and compromised structural and functional integrity of neurons and neural networks could be the primary drivers of increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disease."	0
"32234475"	"Divergent Roles for Macrophage C-type Lectin Receptors, Dectin-1 and Mannose Receptors, in the Intestinal Inflammatory Response.Colonic macrophages are considered to be major effectors of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and the control of gut inflammation through C-type lectin receptors is an emerging concept. We show that during colitis, the loss of dectin-1 on myeloid cells prevents intestinal inflammation, while the lack of mannose receptor (MR) exacerbates it. A marked increase in dectin-1 expression in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-exposed MR-deficient mice supports the critical contribution of dectin-1 to colitis outcome. Dectin-1 is crucial for Ly6C<sup>high</sup>CCR2<sup>high</sup> monocyte population enrichment in the blood and their recruitment to inflamed colon as precursors of inflammatory macrophages. Dectin-1 also promotes inflammasome-dependent interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion through leukotriene B4 production. Interestingly, colonic inflammation is associated with a concomitant overexpression of dectin-1/CCL2/LTA4H and downregulation of MR on macrophages from IBD patients. Thus, MR and dectin-1 on macrophages are important mucosal inflammatory regulators that contribute to the intestinal inflammation."	0
"30797687"	"Physical Basis for the Loading of a Bacterial Replicative Helicase onto DNA.In cells, dedicated AAA+ ATPases deposit hexameric, ring-shaped helicases onto DNA to initiate chromosomal replication. To better understand the mechanisms by which helicase loading can occur, we used cryo-EM to determine sub-4-Å-resolution structures of the E. coli DnaB⋅DnaC helicase⋅loader complex with nucleotide in pre- and post-DNA engagement states. In the absence of DNA, six DnaC protomers latch onto and crack open a DnaB hexamer using an extended N-terminal domain, stabilizing this conformation through nucleotide-dependent ATPase interactions. Upon binding DNA, DnaC hydrolyzes ATP, allowing DnaB to isomerize into a topologically closed, pre-translocation state competent to bind primase. Our data show how DnaC opens the DnaB ring and represses the helicase prior to DNA binding and how DnaC ATPase activity is reciprocally regulated by DnaB and DNA. Comparative analyses reveal how the helicase loading mechanism of DnaC parallels and diverges from homologous AAA+ systems involved in DNA replication and transposition."	0
"32493775"	"Crystal structure of a conformational antibody that binds tau oligomers and inhibits pathological seeding by extracts from donors with Alzheimer's disease.Soluble oligomers of aggregated tau accompany the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils, a histological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and two dozen related neurodegenerative diseases. Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of <i>in vitro</i> tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies."	0
"32049004"	"Transcriptional Correlates of Tolerance and Lethality in Mice Predict Ebola Virus Disease Patient Outcomes.Host response to infection is a major determinant of disease severity in Ebola virus disease (EVD), but gene expression programs associated with outcome are poorly characterized. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice develop strain-dependent EVD phenotypes of differential severity, ranging from tolerance to lethality. We screen 10 CC lines and identify clinical, virologic, and transcriptomic features that distinguish tolerant from lethal outcomes. Tolerance is associated with tightly regulated induction of immune and inflammatory responses shortly following infection, as well as reduced inflammatory macrophages and increased antigen-presenting cells, B-1 cells, and γδ T cells. Lethal disease is characterized by suppressed early gene expression and reduced lymphocytes, followed by uncontrolled inflammatory signaling, leading to death. We apply machine learning to predict outcomes with 99% accuracy in mice using transcriptomic profiles. This signature predicts outcomes in a cohort of EVD patients from western Africa with 75% accuracy, demonstrating potential clinical utility."	0
"32209460"	"TLR4-Mediated Pathway Triggers Interferon-Independent G0 Arrest and Antiviral SAMHD1 Activity in Macrophages.Macrophages exist predominantly in two distinct states, G0 and a G1-like state that is accompanied by phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at T592. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation can potently induce G0 arrest and SAMHD1 antiretroviral activity by an interferon (IFN)-independent pathway. This pathway requires TLR4 engagement with TRIF, but not involvement of TBK1 or IRF3. Exclusive Myd88 activators are unable to trigger G0 arrest or SAMHD1 dephosphorylation, demonstrating this arrest is also Myd88/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) independent. The G0 arrest is accompanied by p21 upregulation and CDK1 depletion, consistent with the observed SAMHD1 dephosphorylation at T592. Furthermore, we show by SAMHD1 knockdown that the TLR4-activated pathway potently blocks HIV-1 infection in macrophages specifically via SAMHD1. Together, these data demonstrate that macrophages can mobilize an intrinsic cell arrest and anti-viral state by activating TLR4 prior to IFN secretion, thereby highlighting the importance of cell-cycle regulation as a response to pathogen-associated danger signals in macrophages."	0
"32251399"	"LSM2-8 and XRN-2 contribute to the silencing of H3K27me3-marked genes through targeted RNA decay.In fission yeast and plants, RNA processing and degradation contribute to heterochromatin silencing, alongside conserved pathways of transcriptional repression. It has not been known whether similar pathways exist in metazoans. Here, we describe a pathway of silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cells, in which the highly conserved RNA-binding complex LSM2-8 contributes selectively to the repression of heterochromatic reporters and endogenous genes bearing the Polycomb mark, histone H3K27me3. This acts by degrading selected transcripts through the XRN-2 exoribonuclease. Disruption of the LSM2-8 pathway leads to mRNA stabilization. Unlike previously described pathways of heterochromatic RNA degradation, LSM2-8-mediated RNA degradation does not target nor require H3K9 methylation. Intriguingly, loss of this pathway coincides with a localized reduction in H3K27me3 at lsm-8-sensitive loci. We have thus uncovered a mechanism of RNA degradation that selectively contributes to the silencing of a subset of H3K27me3-marked genes, revealing a previously unrecognized layer of post-transcriptional control in metazoan heterochromatin."	0
"30930055"	"TOP2β-Dependent Nuclear DNA Damage Shapes Extracellular Growth Factor Responses via Dynamic AKT Phosphorylation to Control Virus Latency.The mTOR pathway integrates both extracellular and intracellular signals and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, survival, and stress responses. Neurotropic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), also rely on cellular AKT-mTORC1 signaling to achieve viral latency. Here, we define a novel genotoxic response whereby spatially separated signals initiated by extracellular neurotrophic factors and nuclear DNA damage are integrated by the AKT-mTORC1 pathway. We demonstrate that endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by Topoisomerase 2β-DNA cleavage complex (TOP2βcc) intermediates are required to achieve AKT-mTORC1 signaling and maintain HSV-1 latency in neurons. Suppression of host DNA-repair pathways that remove TOP2βcc trigger HSV-1 reactivation. Moreover, perturbation of AKT phosphorylation dynamics by downregulating the PHLPP1 phosphatase led to AKT mis-localization and disruption of DSB-induced HSV-1 reactivation. Thus, the cellular genome integrity and environmental inputs are consolidated and co-opted by a latent virus to balance lifelong infection with transmission."	0
"31831627"	"Induction of AP-1 by YAP/TAZ contributes to cell proliferation and organ growth.Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homolog transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are key effectors of the Hippo pathway to control cell growth and organ size, of which dysregulation yields to tumorigenesis or hypertrophy. Upon activation, YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus and bind to TEAD transcription factors to promote transcriptional programs for proliferation or cell specification. Immediate early genes, represented by AP-1 complex, are rapidly induced and control later-phase transcriptional program to play key roles in tumorigenesis and organ maintenance. Here, we report that YAP/TAZ directly promote <i>FOS</i> transcription that in turn contributes to the biological function of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ bind to the promoter region of <i>FOS</i> to stimulate its transcription. Deletion of YAP/TAZ blocks the induction of immediate early genes in response to mitogenic stimuli. <i>FOS</i> induction contributes to expression of YAP/TAZ downstream target genes. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of AP-1 suppresses growth of YAP-driven cancer cells, such as <i>Lats1/2</i>-deficient cancer cells as well as Gα<sub>q/11</sub> mutated uveal melanoma. Furthermore, AP-1 inhibition almost completely abrogates the hepatomegaly induced by YAP overexpression. Our findings reveal a feed-forward interplay between immediate early transcription of AP-1 and Hippo pathway function."	1

Herein, we identify that β-catenin phosphorylated at Y489 (p-β-catenin<sup>Y489</sup>) emerges during human squamous lung cancer progression. This led us to develop a model of airway basal stem cell (ABSC) hyperproliferation by driving Wnt/β-catenin signaling, resulting in a morphology that resembles premalignant lesions and loss of ciliated cell differentiation. To identify small molecules that could reverse this process, we performed a high-throughput drug screen for inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our studies unveil Wnt inhibitor compound 1 (WIC1), which suppresses T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) activity, reduces ABSC proliferation, induces ciliated cell differentiation, and decreases nuclear p-β-catenin<sup>Y489</sup>. Collectively, our work elucidates a dysregulated Wnt/p-β-catenin<sup>Y489</sup> axis in lung premalignancy that can be modeled in vitro and identifies a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor that promotes airway homeostasis. WIC1 may therefore serve as a tool compound in regenerative medicine studies with implications for restoring normal airway homeostasis after injury."	0
"31968257"	"Trypanosoma brucei ATR Links DNA Damage Signaling during Antigenic Variation with Regulation of RNA Polymerase I-Transcribed Surface Antigens.Trypanosoma brucei evades mammalian immunity by using recombination to switch its surface-expressed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), while ensuring that only one of many subtelomeric multigene VSG expression sites are transcribed at a time. DNA repair activities have been implicated in the catalysis of VSG switching by recombination, not transcriptional control. How VSG switching is signaled to guide the appropriate reaction or to integrate switching into parasite growth is unknown. Here, we show that the loss of ATR, a DNA damage-signaling protein kinase, is lethal, causing nuclear genome instability and increased VSG switching through VSG-localized damage. Furthermore, ATR loss leads to the increased transcription of silent VSG expression sites and expression of mixed VSGs on the cell surface, effects that are associated with the altered localization of RNA polymerase I and VEX1. This work shows that ATR acts in antigenic variation both through DNA damage signaling and surface antigen expression control."	0

"32049013"	"A FLCN-TFE3 Feedback Loop Prevents Excessive Glycogenesis and Phagocyte Activation by Regulating Lysosome Activity.The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) suppresses nuclear translocation of TFE3, a master transcription factor for lysosomal biogenesis, via regulation of amino-acid-sensing Rag GTPases. However, the importance of this lysosomal regulation in mammalian physiology remains unclear. Following hematopoietic-lineage-specific Flcn deletion in mice, we found expansion of vacuolated phagocytes that accumulate glycogen in their cytoplasm, phenotypes reminiscent of lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). We report that TFE3 acts in a feedback loop to transcriptionally activate FLCN expression, and FLCN loss disrupts this loop, augmenting TFE3 activity. Tfe3 deletion in Flcn knockout mice reduces the number of phagocytes and ameliorates LSD-like phenotypes. We further reveal that TFE3 stimulates glycogenesis by promoting the expression of glycogenesis genes, including Gys1 and Gyg, upon loss of Flcn. Taken together, we propose that the FLCN-TFE3 feedback loop acts as a rheostat to control lysosome activity and prevents excessive glycogenesis and LSD-like phagocyte activation."	1
"31278053"	"HAT1 Coordinates Histone Production and Acetylation via H4 Promoter Binding.The energetic costs of duplicating chromatin are large and therefore likely depend on nutrient sensing checkpoints and metabolic inputs. By studying chromatin modifiers regulated by epithelial growth factor, we identified histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) as an induced gene that enhances proliferation through coordinating histone production, acetylation, and glucose metabolism. In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase, we isolated a HAT1-containing complex bound specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1-dependent transcription of H4 genes required an acetate-sensitive promoter element. HAT1 expression was critical for S-phase progression and maintenance of H3 lysine 9 acetylation at proliferation-associated genes, including histone genes. Therefore, these data describe a feedforward circuit whereby HAT1 captures acetyl groups on nascent histones and drives H4 production by chromatin binding to support chromatin replication and acetylation. These findings have important implications for human disease, since high HAT1 levels associate with poor outcomes across multiple cancer types."	0

"30735655"	"Reprogramming of Meiotic Chromatin Architecture during Spermatogenesis.Chromatin organization undergoes drastic reconfiguration during gametogenesis. However, the molecular reprogramming of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process remains poorly understood for mammals, including primates. Here, we examined three-dimensional chromatin architecture during spermatogenesis in rhesus monkey using low-input Hi-C. Interestingly, we found that topologically associating domains (TADs) undergo dissolution and reestablishment in spermatogenesis. Strikingly, pachytene spermatocytes, where synapsis occurs, are strongly depleted for TADs despite their active transcription state but uniquely show highly refined local compartments that alternate between transcribing and non-transcribing regions (refined-A/B). Importantly, such chromatin organization is conserved in mouse, where it remains largely intact upon transcription inhibition. Instead, it is attenuated in mutant spermatocytes, where the synaptonemal complex failed to be established. Intriguingly, this is accompanied by the restoration of TADs, suggesting that the synaptonemal complex may restrict TADs and promote local compartments. Thus, these data revealed extensive reprogramming of higher-order meiotic chromatin architecture during mammalian gametogenesis."	0

Mitotic chromosome missegregation stimulates cGAS activity; however, it is unclear whether progression through mitosis is required for cancercell-intrinsic activation of anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, it is unknown whether cell cycle checkpoint disruption can restore responses in cancer cells that are recalcitrant to DNAdamage-induced inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that prolonged cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>-mitosis boundary from either excessive DNA damage or CDK1 inhibition prevents inflammatory-stimulated gene expression and immune-mediated destruction of distal tumors. Remarkably, DNAdamage-induced inflammatory signaling is restored in a RIG-I-dependent manner upon concomitant disruption of p53 and the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint. These findings link aberrant cell progression and p53 loss to an expanded spectrum of damage-associated molecular pattern recognition and have implications for the design of rational approaches to augment anti-tumor immune responses."	0
"32075734"	"Regulatory Dynamics of Tet1 and Oct4 Resolve Stages of Global DNA Demethylation and Transcriptomic Changes in Reprogramming.Reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) involves the reactivation of endogenous pluripotency genes and global DNA demethylation, but temporal resolution of these events using existing markers is limited. Here, we generate murine transgenic lines harboring reporters for the 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1 and for Oct4. By monitoring dual reporter fluorescence during pluripotency entry, we identify a sequential order of Tet1 and Oct4 activation by proximal and distal regulatory elements. Full Tet1 activation marks an intermediate stage that accompanies predominantly repression of somatic genes, preceding full Oct4 activation, and distinguishes two waves of global DNA demethylation that target distinct genomic features but are uncoupled from transcriptional changes. Tet1 knockout shows that TET1 contributes to both waves of demethylation and activates germline regulatory genes in reprogramming intermediates but is dispensable for Oct4 reactivation. Our dual reporter system for time-resolving pluripotency entry thus refines the molecular roadmap of iPSC maturation."	0
"32649884"	"Epigenetic Regulation of DNA Repair Pathway Choice by MacroH2A1 Splice Variants Ensures Genome Stability.The inactive X chromosome (Xi) is inherently susceptible to genomic aberrations. Replication stress (RS) has been proposed as an underlying cause, but the mechanisms that protect from Xi instability remain unknown. Here, we show that macroH2A1.2, an RS-protective histone variant enriched on the Xi, is required for Xi integrity and female survival. Mechanistically, macroH2A1.2 counteracts its structurally distinct and equally Xi-enriched alternative splice variant, macroH2A1.1. Comparative proteomics identified a role for macroH2A1.1 in alternative end joining (alt-EJ), which accounts for Xi anaphase defects in the absence of macroH2A1.2. Genomic instability was rescued by simultaneous depletion of macroH2A1.1 or alt-EJ factors, and mice deficient for both macroH2A1 variants harbor no overt female defects. Notably, macroH2A1 splice variant imbalance affected alt-EJ capacity also in tumor cells. Together, these findings identify macroH2A1 splicing as a modulator of genome maintenance that ensures Xi integrity and may, more broadly, predict DNA repair outcome in malignant cells."	0

The bile acid 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS) is a major component of the sex pheromone mixture from male sea lamprey that induces specific olfactory and behavioral responses in conspecific individuals. Olfactory receptors interact directly with pheromones, which is the first step in their detection, but identifying the cognate receptors of specific pheromones is often challenging. Here, we deorphanized two highly related odorant receptors (ORs), OR320a and OR320b, of <i>P. marinus</i> that respond to 3kPZS. In a heterologous expression system coupled to a cAMP-responsive CRE-luciferase, OR320a and OR320b specifically responded to C<sub>24</sub> 5α-bile acids, and both receptors were activated by the same set of 3kPZS analogs. OR320a displayed larger responses to all 3kPZS analogs than did OR320b. This difference appeared to be largely determined by a single amino acid residue, Cys-79<sup>2.56</sup>, the C-terminal sixth residue relative to the most conserved residue in the second transmembrane domain (2.56) of OR320a. This region of TM2 residues 2.56-2.60 apparently is critical for the detection of steroid compounds by odorant receptors in lamprey, zebrafish, and humans. Finally, we identified OR320 orthologs in Japanese lamprey (<i>Lethenteron camtschaticum</i>), suggesting that the OR320 family may be widely present in lamprey species and that OR320 may be under purifying selection. Our results provide a system to examine the origin of olfactory steroid detection in vertebrates and to define a highly conserved molecular mechanism for steroid-ligand detection by G protein-coupled receptors."	0

The most common form of this disease (CMT1A, 1:4000) is associated with duplication of chromosome fragment 17p11.2-12, which results in a third WT <i>PMP22</i> allele. In rodent models overexpressing the PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein 22) protein and in dermal fibroblasts from patients with CMT1A, PMP22 aggregates have been observed. This suggests that overexpression of PMP22 under CMT1A conditions overwhelms the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system, leading to formation of cytotoxic aggregates. In this work, we used a single-cell flow-cytometry trafficking assay to quantitatively examine the relationship between PMP22 expression and trafficking efficiency in individual cells. We observed that as expression of WT or disease variants of PMP22 is increased, the amount of intracellular PMP22 increases to a greater extent than the amount of surface-trafficked protein. This was true for both transiently transfected cells and PMP22 stable expressing cells. Our results support the notion that overexpression of PMP22 in CMT1A leads to a disproportionate increase in misfolding and mistrafficking of PMP22, which is likely a contributor to disease pathology and progression."	0

"30819644"	"Selective Roles of Vertebrate PCF11 in Premature and Full-Length Transcript Termination.The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including mNET-seq, 3' mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and consequent gene downregulation. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination."	0
"32130905"	"Functional Diversity of Glycinergic Commissural Inhibitory Neurons in Larval Zebrafish.Commissural inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord of aquatic vertebrates coordinate left-right body alternation during swimming. Their developmental origin, however, has been elusive. We investigate this by comparing the anatomy and function of two commissural inhibitory neuron types, dI6dmrt3a and V0d, derived from the pd6 and p0 progenitor domains, respectively. We find that both of these commissural neuron types have monosynaptic, inhibitory connections to neuronal populations active during fictive swimming, supporting their role in providing inhibition to the contralateral side. V0d neurons tend to fire during faster and stronger movements, while dI6dmrt3a neurons tend to fire more consistently during normal fictive swimming. Ablation of dI6dmrt3a neurons leads to an impairment of left-right alternating activity through abnormal co-activation of ventral root neurons on both sides of the spinal cord. Our results suggest that dI6dmrt3a and V0d commissural inhibitory neurons synergistically provide inhibition to the opposite side across different swimming behaviors."	0

The biogenesis of this 93 kDa multi-domain protein is assisted by the chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Here, we show in yeast cells that the highly conserved protein Hgh1 (FAM203 in humans) is a chaperone that cooperates with TRiC in eEF2 folding. In the absence of Hgh1, a substantial fraction of newly synthesized eEF2 is degraded or aggregates. We solved the crystal structure of Hgh1 and analyzed the interaction of wild-type and mutant Hgh1 with eEF2. These experiments revealed that Hgh1 is an armadillo repeat protein that binds to the dynamic central domain III of eEF2 via a bipartite interface. Hgh1 binding recruits TRiC to the C-terminal eEF2 module and prevents unproductive interactions of domain III, allowing efficient folding of the N-terminal GTPase module. eEF2 folding is completed upon dissociation of TRiC and Hgh1."	0
"32783932"	"Distinct Waves from the Hemogenic Endothelium Give Rise to Layered Lymphoid Tissue Inducer Cell Ontogeny.During embryogenesis, lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells are essential for lymph node organogenesis. These cells are part of the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family. Although their earliest embryonic hematopoietic origin is unclear, other innate immune cells have been shown to be derived from early hemogenic endothelium in the yolk sac as well as the aorta-gonad-mesonephros. A proper model to discriminate between these locations was unavailable. In this study, using a Cxcr4-CreERT2 lineage tracing model, we identify a major contribution from embryonic hemogenic endothelium, but not the yolk sac, toward LTi progenitors. Conversely, embryonic LTi cells are replaced by hematopoietic stem cell-derived cells in adults. We further show that, in the fetal liver, common lymphoid progenitors differentiate into highly dynamic alpha-lymphoid precursor cells that, at this embryonic stage, preferentially mature into LTi precursors and establish their functional LTi cell identity only after reaching the periphery."	0
"32726616"	"PHF7 Modulates BRDT Stability and Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis.Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system."	1

DPs apparently began to emerge during the aquatic-to-land transition, with phylogenetic analyses revealing the presence of numerous DP subfamilies in the plant kingdom. The vast majority (>95%) of DPs in these large multigene families still await discovery of their biochemical functions. Here, we elucidated the 3D structures of two pterocarpan-forming proteins with dirigent-like domains. Both proteins stereospecifically convert distinct diastereomeric chiral isoflavonoid precursors to the chiral pterocarpans, (-)- and (+)-medicarpin, respectively. Their 3D structures enabled comparisons with stereoselective lignan- and aromatic terpenoid-forming DP orthologs. Each protein provides entry into diverse plant natural products classes, and our experiments suggest a common biochemical mechanism in binding and stabilizing distinct plant phenol-derived mono- and bis-quinone methide intermediates during different C-C and C-O bond-forming processes. These observations provide key insights into both their appearance and functional diversification of DPs during land plant evolution/adaptation. The proposed biochemical mechanisms based on our findings provide important clues to how additional physiological roles for DPs and proteins harboring dirigent-like domains can now be rationally and systematically identified."	0
"32502422"	"SAFB2 Enables the Processing of Suboptimal Stem-Loop Structures in Clustered Primary miRNA Transcripts.Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are generated from primary transcripts containing multiple clustered stem-loop structures that are thought to be recognized and cleaved by the Microprocessor complex as independent units. Here, we uncover an unexpected mode of processing of the bicistronic miR-15a-16-1 cluster. We find that the primary miR-15a stem-loop is not processed on its own but that the presence of the neighboring primary miR-16-1 stem-loop on the same transcript can compensate for this deficiency in cis. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identify SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) as an essential co-factor in this miR-16-1-assisted pri-miR-15 cleavage and describe SAFB2 as an accessory protein of the Microprocessor. Notably, SAFB2-mediated cleavage expands to other clustered pri-miRNAs, indicating a general mechanism. Together, our study reveals an unrecognized function of SAFB2 in miRNA processing and suggests a scenario in which SAFB2 enables the binding and processing of suboptimal Microprocessor substrates in clustered primary miRNA transcripts."	0

We report on cryo-EM structures of Thermococcus onnurineus Csm<sup>crRNA</sup> binary, Csm<sup>crRNA</sup>-target RNA and Csm<sup>crRNA</sup>-target RNA<sup>anti-tag</sup> ternary complexes in the 3.1 Å range. The topological features of the crRNA 5'-repeat tag explains the 5'-ruler mechanism for defining target cleavage sites, with accessibility of positions -2 to -5 within the 5'-repeat serving as sensors for avoidance of autoimmunity. The Csm3 thumb elements introduce periodic kinks in the crRNA-target RNA duplex, facilitating cleavage of the target RNA with 6-nt periodicity. Key Glu residues within a Csm1 loop segment of Csm<sup>crRNA</sup> adopt a proposed autoinhibitory conformation suggestive of DNase activity regulation. These structural findings, complemented by mutational studies of key intermolecular contacts, provide insights into Csm<sup>crRNA</sup> complex assembly, mechanisms underlying RNA targeting and site-specific periodic cleavage, regulation of DNase cleavage activity, and autoimmunity suppression."	0
"31995767"	"Immunological Fingerprints of Controllers Developing Neutralizing HIV-1 Antibodies.The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is highly desired for an effective vaccine against HIV-1. Typically, bnAbs develop in patients with high viremia, but they can also evolve in some untreated HIV-1 controllers with low viral loads. Here, we identify a subgroup of neutralizer-controllers characterized by myeloid DCs (mDCs) with a distinct inflammatory signature and a superior ability to prime T follicular helper (Tfh)-like cells in an STAT4-dependent fashion. This distinct immune profile is associated with a higher frequency of Tfh-like cells in peripheral blood (pTfh) and an enrichment for Tfh-defining genes in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Correspondingly, monocytes from this neutralizer controller subgroup upregulate genes encoding for chemotaxis and inflammation, and they secrete high levels of IL-12 in response to TLR stimulation. Our results suggest the existence of multi-compartment immune networks between mDCs, Tfh, and monocytes that may facilitate the development of bnAbs in a subgroup of HIV-1 controllers."	0
"32402291"	"In Vivo Cell Fate Tracing Provides No Evidence for Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition in Adult Fallopian Tube and Uterus.The mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is thought to be involved in the maintenance, repair, and carcinogenesis of the fallopian tube (oviduct) and uterine epithelium. However, conclusive evidence for the conversion of mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells in these organs is lacking. Using embryonal cell lineage tracing with reporters driven by mesenchymal cell marker genes of the female reproductive tract (AMHR2, CSPG4, and PDGFRβ), we show that these reporters are also expressed by some oviductal and uterine epithelial cells at birth. These mesenchymal reporter-positive epithelial cells are maintained in adult mice across multiple pregnancies, respond to ovarian hormones, and form organoids. However, no labeled epithelial cells are present in any oviductal or uterine epithelia when mesenchymal cell labeling was induced in adult mice. Organoids developed from mice labeled in adulthood were also negative for mesenchymal reporters. Collectively, our work found no definitive evidence of MET in the adult fallopian tube and uterine epithelium."	0
"32130911"	"Wss1 Promotes Replication Stress Tolerance by Degrading Histones.Timely completion of DNA replication is central to accurate cell division and to the maintenance of genomic stability. However, certain DNA-protein interactions can physically impede DNA replication fork progression. Cells remove or bypass these physical impediments by different mechanisms to preserve DNA macromolecule integrity and genome stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wss1, the DNA-protein crosslink repair protease, allows cells to tolerate hydroxyurea-induced replication stress, but the underlying mechanism by which Wss1 promotes this function has remained unknown. Here, we report that Wss1 provides cells tolerance to replication stress by directly degrading core histone subunits that non-specifically and non-covalently bind to single-stranded DNA. Unlike Wss1-dependent proteolysis of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks, proteolysis of histones does not require Cdc48 nor SUMO-binding activities. Wss1 thus acts as a multi-functional protease capable of targeting a broad range of covalent and non-covalent DNA-binding proteins to preserve genome stability during adverse conditions."	0
"32160548"	"ERM-Dependent Assembly of T Cell Receptor Signaling and Co-stimulatory Molecules on Microvilli prior to Activation.T cell surfaces are covered with microvilli, actin-rich and flexible protrusions. We use super-resolution microscopy to show that ≥90% of T cell receptor (TCR) complex molecules TCRαβ and TCRζ, as well as the co-receptor CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD2, reside on microvilli of resting human T cells. Furthermore, TCR proximal signaling molecules involved in the initial stages of the immune response, including the protein tyrosine kinase Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) and the key adaptor LAT (linker for activation of T cells), are also enriched on microvilli. Notably, phosphorylated proteins of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family colocalize with TCRαβ as well as with actin filaments, implying a role for one or more ERMs in linking the TCR complex to the actin cytoskeleton within microvilli. Our results establish microvilli as key signaling hubs, in which the TCR complex and its proximal signaling molecules and adaptors are preassembled prior to activation in an ERM-dependent manner, facilitating initial antigen sensing."	0

"32640215"	"Kinetic Heterogeneity of Cancer Cell Fractional Killing.Lethal drugs can induce incomplete cell death in a population of cancer cells, a phenomenon referred to as fractional killing. Here, we show that high-throughput population-level time-lapse imaging can be used to quantify fractional killing in response to hundreds of different drug treatments in parallel. We find that stable intermediate levels of fractional killing are uncommon, with many drug treatments resulting in complete or near-complete eradication of all cells, if given enough time. The kinetics of fractional killing over time vary substantially as a function of drug, drug dose, and genetic background. At the molecular level, the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of the kinetics of fractional killing in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli. These studies suggest that fractional killing is governed by diverse lethal stimulus-specific mechanisms."	0
"32697998"	"A Synthetic Likelihood Solution to the Silent Synapse Estimation Problem.Functional features of synaptic populations are typically inferred from random electrophysiological sampling of small subsets of synapses. Are these samples unbiased? Here, we develop a biophysically constrained statistical framework to address this question and apply it to assess the performance of a widely used method based on a failure-rate analysis to quantify the occurrence of silent (AMPAR-lacking) synapses. We simulate this method in silico and find that it is characterized by strong and systematic biases, poor reliability, and weak statistical power. Key conclusions are validated by whole-cell recordings from hippocampal neurons. To address these shortcomings, we develop a simulator of the experimental protocol and use it to compute a synthetic likelihood. By maximizing the likelihood, we infer silent synapse fraction with no bias, low variance, and superior statistical power over alternatives. Together, this generalizable approach highlights how a simulator of experimental methodologies can substantially improve the estimation of physiological properties."	0
"32661195"	"Spectroscopic evidence for direct flavin-flavin contact in a bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein.A remarkable charge transfer (CT) band is described in the bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein (Bf-ETF) from <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i> (<i>Rpa</i>ETF). <i>Rpa</i>ETF contains two FADs that play contrasting roles in electron bifurcation. The Bf-FAD accepts electrons pairwise from NADH, directs one to a lower-reduction midpoint potential (<i>E</i>°) carrier, and the other to the higher-<i>E</i>° electron transfer FAD (ET-FAD). Previous work noted that a CT band at 726 nm formed when ET-FAD was reduced and Bf-FAD was oxidized, suggesting that both flavins participate. However, existing crystal structures place them too far apart to interact directly. We present biochemical experiments addressing this conundrum and elucidating the nature of this CT species. We observed that <i>Rpa</i>ETF missing either FAD lacked the 726 nm band. Site-directed mutagenesis near either FAD produced altered yields of the CT species, supporting involvement of both flavins. The residue substitutions did not alter the absorption maximum of the signal, ruling out contributions from residue orbitals. Instead, we propose that the residue identities modulate the population of a protein conformation that brings the ET-flavin and Bf-flavin into direct contact, explaining the 726 nm band based on a CT complex of reduced ET-FAD and oxidized Bf-FAD. This is corroborated by persistence of the 726 nm species during gentle protein denaturation and simple density functional theory calculations of flavin dimers. Although such a CT complex has been demonstrated for free flavins, this is the first observation of such, to our knowledge, in an enzyme. Thus, Bf-ETFs may optimize electron transfer efficiency by enabling direct flavin-flavin contact."	0
"32354834"	"The spatial regulation of condensin activity in chromosome condensation.Condensin mediates chromosome condensation, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Prior to anaphase of budding yeast, the ribosomal DNA (RDN) condenses to a thin loop that is distinct from the rest of the chromosomes. We provide evidence that the establishment and maintenance of this RDN condensation requires the regulation of condensin by Cdc5p (polo) kinase. We show that Cdc5p is recruited to the site of condensin binding in the RDN by cohesin, a complex related to condensin. Cdc5p and cohesin prevent condensin from misfolding the RDN into an irreversibly decondensed state. From these and other observations, we propose that the spatial regulation of Cdc5p by cohesin modulates condensin activity to ensure proper RDN folding into a thin loop. This mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved, promoting the thinly condensed constrictions that occur at centromeres and RDN of mitotic chromosomes in plants and animals."	0
"32049017"	"Targeting Macrophage Histone H3 Modification as a Leishmania Strategy to Dampen the NF-κB/NLRP3-Mediated Inflammatory Response.Aberrant macrophage activation during intracellular infection generates immunopathologies that can cause severe human morbidity. A better understanding of immune subversion strategies and macrophage phenotypic and functional responses is necessary to design host-directed intervention strategies. Here, we uncover a fine-tuned transcriptional response that is induced in primary and lesional macrophages infected by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis and dampens NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Subversion is amastigote-specific and characterized by a decreased expression of activating and increased expression of de-activating components of these pro-inflammatory pathways, thus revealing a regulatory dichotomy that abrogates the anti-microbial response. Changes in transcript abundance correlate with histone H3K9/14 hypoacetylation and H3K4 hypo-trimethylation in infected primary and lesional macrophages at promoters of NF-κB-related, pro-inflammatory genes. Our results reveal a Leishmania immune subversion strategy targeting host cell epigenetic regulation to establish conditions beneficial for parasite survival and open avenues for host-directed, anti-microbial drug discovery."	0
"31300274"	"Nuclear TARBP2 Drives Oncogenic Dysregulation of RNA Splicing and Decay.Post-transcriptional regulation of RNA stability is a key step in gene expression control. We describe a regulatory program, mediated by the RNA binding protein TARBP2, that controls RNA stability in the nucleus. TARBP2 binding to pre-mRNAs results in increased intron retention, subsequently leading to targeted degradation of TARBP2-bound transcripts. This is mediated by TARBP2 recruitment of the m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation machinery to its target transcripts, where deposition of m<sup>6</sup>A marks influences the recruitment of splicing regulators, inhibiting efficient splicing. Interactions between TARBP2 and the nucleoprotein TPR then promote degradation of these TARBP2-bound transcripts by the nuclear exosome. Additionally, analysis of clinical gene expression datasets revealed a functional role for TARBP2 in lung cancer. Using xenograft mouse models, we find that TARBP2 affects tumor growth in the lung and that this is dependent on TARBP2-mediated destabilization of ABCA3 and FOXN3. Finally, we establish ZNF143 as an upstream regulator of TARBP2 expression."	0

However, their origin and biological purpose remain unclear. We show that these antisense lncRNA can be generated by R-loops that form when nascent transcript invades the DNA duplex behind elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Biochemically, R-loops act as intrinsic Pol II promoters to induce de novo RNA synthesis. Furthermore, their removal across the human genome by RNase H1 overexpression causes the selective reduction of antisense transcription. Consequently, we predict that R-loops act to facilitate the synthesis of many gene proximal antisense lncRNA. Not only are R-loops widely associated with DNA damage and repair, but we now show that they have the capacity to promote de novo transcript synthesis that may have aided the evolution of gene regulation."	0

Here, we identify Pvt1b, a p53-dependent isoform of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Pvt1, expressed 50 kb downstream of Myc, which becomes induced by DNA damage or oncogenic signaling and accumulates near its site of transcription. We show that production of the Pvt1b RNA is necessary and sufficient to suppress Myc transcription in cis without altering the chromatin organization of the locus. Inhibition of Pvt1b increases Myc levels and transcriptional activity and promotes cellular proliferation. Furthermore, Pvt1b loss accelerates tumor growth, but not tumor progression, in an autochthonous mouse model of lung cancer. These findings demonstrate that Pvt1b acts at the intersection of the p53 and Myc transcriptional networks to reinforce the anti-proliferative activities of p53."	1

Here, by analyzing <i>in vitro</i> helicase activity, dissociation of UPF1 from purified mRNPs, and transcriptome-wide UPF1 RNA binding, we present the mechanistic basis for inhibition of NMD by PTBP1. Unlike mechanisms of RNA stabilization that depend on direct competition for binding sites among protective RNA-binding proteins and decay factors, PTBP1 promotes displacement of UPF1 already bound to potential substrates. Our results show that PTBP1 directly exploits the tendency of UPF1 to release RNA upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. We further find that UPF1 sensitivity to PTBP1 is coordinated by a regulatory loop in domain 1B of UPF1. We propose that the UPF1 regulatory loop and protective proteins control kinetic proofreading of potential NMD substrates, presenting a new model for RNA helicase regulation and target selection in the NMD pathway."	0
"32354836"	"Distinct roles of BRCA2 in replication fork protection in response to hydroxyurea and DNA interstrand cross-links.DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are a form of DNA damage that requires the interplay of a number of repair proteins including those of the Fanconi anemia (FA) and the homologous recombination (HR) pathways. Pathogenic variants in the essential gene <i>BRCA2/FANCD1,</i> when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 function in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 recombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and RAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has been shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant nuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. Here, based on the analysis of <i>BRCA2</i> DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants (c.8488-1G>A and c.8524C>T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical FA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of DNA at ICLs. Cells carrying <i>BRCA2</i> DBD mutations are sensitive to ICL-inducing agents but resistant to HU treatment consistent with relatively high HR repair in these cells. BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN nuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the resection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate that unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 translocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not an integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of fork protection at different DNA lesions."	0
"32905763"	"OPG Production Matters Where It Happened.Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a circulating decoy receptor for RANKL, a multifunctional cytokine essential for the differentiation of tissue-specific cells in bone and immune systems such as osteoclasts, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), and intestinal microfold cells (M cells). However, it is unknown whether OPG functions only at the production site or circulates to other tissues acting in an endocrine fashion. Here we explore the cellular source of OPG by generating OPG-floxed mice and show that locally produced OPG, rather than circulating OPG, is crucial for bone and immune homeostasis. Deletion of OPG in osteoblastic cells leads to severe osteopenia without affecting serum OPG. Deletion of locally produced OPG increases mTEC and M cell numbers while retaining the normal serum OPG level. This study shows that OPG limits its functions within the tissue where it was produced, illuminating the importance of local regulation of the RANKL system."	0

We used CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer human cell lines expressing POLE tumor variants, with and without mismatch repair (MMR). Whole-exome sequencing of these cells after defined numbers of population doublings permitted analysis of nascent mutation accumulation. Unlike an exonuclease active site mutant that we previously characterized, POLE cancer mutants readily drive signature mutagenesis in the presence of functional MMR. Comparison of cell line and human patient data suggests that the relative abundance of mutation signatures partitions POLE tumors into distinct subgroups dependent on the nature of the POLE allele, its expression level, and MMR status.

We identify significant correlations between the transcriptome, host cell infiltrates, matrisome, vasculature, and tissue modulus of mouse and human TMEs, with several stromal and malignant targets in common. However, each model shows distinct differences and potential vulnerabilities that enabled us to test predictions about response to chemotherapy and an anti-IL-6 antibody.

Thus, pUL145 constitutes a viral DDB1-cullin-associated factor (vDCAF), which mimics cellular DCAFs to exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome system to impede antiviral immunity. Notably, the viral exploitation of the cullins can be targeted to restore the efficacy of the host immune response."	0
"32610137"	"Promiscuous Binding of Microprotein Mozart1 to γ-Tubulin Complex Mediates Specific Subcellular Targeting to Control Microtubule Array Formation.How γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a master template for microtubule nucleation, is spatially and temporally regulated for the assembly of new microtubule arrays remains unclear. Here, we report that an evolutionarily conserved microprotein, Mozart1 (Mzt1), regulates subcellular targeting and microtubule formation activity of γ-TuRC at different cell cycle stages. Crystal structures of protein complexes demonstrate that Mzt1 promiscuously interacts with the N-terminal domains of multiple γ-tubulin complex protein subunits in γ-TuRC via an intercalative binding mode. Genetic- and microscopy-based analyses show that promiscuous binding of Mzt1 in γ-TuRC controls specific subcellular localization of γ-TuRC to modulate microtubule nucleation and stabilization in fission yeast. Moreover, we find Mzt1-independent targeting of γ-TuRC to be crucial for mitotic spindle assembly, demonstrating the cell-cycle-dependent regulation and function of γ-TuRC. Our findings reveal a microprotein-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying microtubule cytoskeleton formation, whereby Mzt1 binding promiscuity confers localization specificity on the multi-protein complex γ-TuRC."	0
"32160535"	"The Synaptic Vesicle Priming Protein CAPS-1 Shapes the Adaptation of Sensory Evoked Responses in Mouse Visual Cortex.Short-term plasticity gates information transfer across neuronal synapses and is thought to be involved in fundamental brain processes, such as cortical gain control and sensory adaptation. Neurons employ synaptic vesicle priming proteins of the CAPS and Munc13 families to shape short-term plasticity in vitro, but the relevance of this phenomenon for information processing in the intact brain is unknown. By combining sensory stimulation with in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice, we show that genetic deletion of CAPS-1 in thalamic neurons results in more rapid adaptation of sensory-evoked subthreshold responses in layer 4 neurons of the primary visual cortex. Optogenetic experiments in acute brain slices further reveal that the enhanced adaptation is caused by more pronounced short-term synaptic depression. Our data indicate that neurons engage CAPS-family priming proteins to shape short-term plasticity for optimal sensory information transfer between thalamic and cortical neurons in the intact brain in vivo."	0
"32753671"	"Robust gene expression programs underlie recurrent cell states and phenotype switching in melanoma.Melanoma cells can switch between a melanocytic and a mesenchymal-like state. Scattered evidence indicates that additional intermediate state(s) may exist. Here, to search for such states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied 10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching. Taken together, these analyses indicate that an intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct and stable 'mixed' GRN rather than being a symbiotic heterogeneous mix of cells."	0
"32142684"	"Dynamic Regulation of Mitochondrial Import by the Ubiquitin System.Mitochondria import nearly their entire proteome from the cytoplasm by translocating precursor proteins through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. Here, we show dynamic regulation of mitochondrial import by the ubiquitin system. Acute pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of the mitochondrial deubiquitinase (DUB) USP30 triggers accumulation of Ub-substrates that are normally localized inside the mitochondria. Mitochondrial import of USP30 substrates is impaired in USP30 knockout (KO) cells, suggesting that deubiquitination promotes efficient import. Upstream of USP30, the E3 ligase March5 ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins whose eventual import depends on USP30. In USP30 KOs, exogenous March5 expression induces accumulation of unimported translocation intermediates that are degraded by the proteasomes. In USP30 KO mice, TOM subunits have reduced abundance across multiple tissues. Together these data highlight how protein import into a subcellular compartment can be regulated by ubiquitination and deubiquitination by E3 ligase and DUB machinery positioned at the gate."	0
"32348750"	"Molecular Basis of Zinc-Dependent Endocytosis of Human ZIP4 Transceptor.Nutrient transporters can be rapidly removed from the cell surface via substrate-stimulated endocytosis as a way to control nutrient influx, but the molecular underpinnings are not well understood. In this work, we focus on zinc-dependent endocytosis of human ZIP4 (hZIP4), a zinc transporter that is essential for dietary zinc uptake. Structure-guided mutagenesis and internalization assay reveal that hZIP4 per se acts as the exclusive zinc sensor, with the transport site's being responsible for zinc sensing. In an effort of seeking sorting signal, a scan of the longest cytosolic loop (L2) leads to identification of a conserved Leu-Gln-Leu motif that is essential for endocytosis. Partial proteolysis of purified hZIP4 demonstrates a structural coupling between the transport site and the L2 upon zinc binding, which supports a working model of how zinc ions at physiological concentration trigger a conformation-dependent endocytosis of the zinc transporter. This work provides a paradigm on post-translational regulation of nutrient transporters."	0

"32579935"	"Small Molecule Dysregulation of TEAD Lipidation Induces a Dominant-Negative Inhibition of Hippo Pathway Signaling.The transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors serves as the receptors for the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ, to upregulate the expression of multiple genes involved in cellular proliferation and survival. Recent work identified TEAD S-palmitoylation as critical for protein stability and activity as the lipid tail extends into a hydrophobic core of the protein. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a potent small molecule that binds the TEAD lipid pocket (LP) and disrupts TEAD S-palmitoylation. Using a variety of biochemical, structural, and cellular methods, we uncover that TEAD S-palmitoylation functions as a TEAD homeostatic protein level checkpoint and that dysregulation of this lipidation affects TEAD transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting the TEAD LP is a promising therapeutic strategy for modulating the Hippo pathway, showing tumor stasis in a mouse xenograft model."	0
"32075739"	"Physiological Tolerance to ssDNA Enables Strand Uncoupling during DNA Replication.It has been long assumed that normally leading strand synthesis must proceed coordinated with the lagging strand to prevent strand uncoupling and the pathological accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the cell, a dogma recently challenged by in vitro studies in prokaryotes. Here, we report that human DNA polymerases can function independently at each strand in vivo and that the resulting strand uncoupling is supported physiologically by a cellular tolerance to ssDNA. Active forks rapidly accumulate ssDNA at the lagging strand when POLA1 is inhibited without triggering a stress response, despite ssDNA formation being considered a hallmark of replication stress. Acute POLA1 inhibition causes a lethal RPA exhaustion, but cells can duplicate their DNA with limited POLA1 activity and exacerbated strand uncoupling as long as RPA molecules suffice to protect the elevated ssDNA. Although robust, this uncoupled mode of DNA replication is also an in-built weakness that can be targeted for cancer treatment."	0
"32160553"	"The FTLD Risk Factor TMEM106B Regulates the Transport of Lysosomes at the Axon Initial Segment of Motoneurons.Genetic variations in TMEM106B, coding for a lysosomal membrane protein, affect frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in GRN- (coding for progranulin) and C9orf72-expansion carriers and might play a role in aging. To determine the physiological function of TMEM106B, we generated TMEM106B-deficient mice. These mice develop proximal axonal swellings caused by drastically enlarged LAMP1-positive vacuoles, increased retrograde axonal transport of lysosomes, and accumulation of lipofuscin and autophagosomes. Giant vacuoles specifically accumulate at the distal end and within the axon initial segment, but not in peripheral nerves or at axon terminals, resulting in an impaired facial-nerve-dependent motor performance. These data implicate TMEM106B in mediating the axonal transport of LAMP1-positive organelles in motoneurons and axonal sorting at the initial segment. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how TMEM106B affects lysosomal proteolysis and degradative capacity in neurons."	0
"32640237"	"Single-Cell and Population Transcriptomics Reveal Pan-epithelial Remodeling in Type 2-High Asthma.The type 2 cytokine-high asthma endotype (T2H) is characterized by IL-13-driven mucus obstruction of the airways. To further investigate this incompletely understood pathobiology, we characterize IL-13 effects on human airway epithelial cell cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing, finding that IL-13 generates a distinctive transcriptional state for each cell type. Specifically, we discover a mucus secretory program induced by IL-13 in all cell types which converts both mucus and defense secretory cells into a metaplastic state with emergent mucin production and secretion, while leading to ER stress and cell death in ciliated cells. The IL-13-remodeled epithelium secretes a pathologic, mucin-imbalanced, and innate immunity-depleted proteome that arrests mucociliary motion. Signatures of IL-13-induced cellular remodeling are mirrored by transcriptional signatures characteristic of the nasal airway epithelium within T2H versus T2-low asthmatic children. Our results reveal the epithelium-wide scope of T2H asthma and present candidate therapeutic targets for restoring normal epithelial function."	0
"32439635"	"UAP56/DDX39B is a major cotranscriptional RNA-DNA helicase that unwinds harmful R loops genome-wide.Nonscheduled R loops represent a major source of DNA damage and replication stress. Cells have different ways to prevent R-loop accumulation. One mechanism relies on the conserved THO complex in association with cotranscriptional RNA processing factors including the RNA-dependent ATPase UAP56/DDX39B and histone modifiers such as the SIN3 deacetylase in humans. We investigated the function of UAP56/DDX39B in R-loop removal. We show that UAP56 depletion causes R-loop accumulation, R-loop-mediated genome instability, and replication fork stalling. We demonstrate an RNA-DNA helicase activity in UAP56 and show that its overexpression suppresses R loops and genome instability induced by depleting five different unrelated factors. UAP56/DDX39B localizes to active chromatin and prevents the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids over the entire genome. We propose that, in addition to its RNA processing role, UAP56/DDX39B is a key helicase required to eliminate harmful cotranscriptional RNA structures that otherwise would block transcription and replication."	0
"32937119"	"Structural Basis for Regulation of the Opposing (p)ppGpp Synthetase and Hydrolase within the Stringent Response Orchestrator Rel.The stringent response enables metabolic adaptation of bacteria under stress conditions and is governed by RelA/SpoT Homolog (RSH)-type enzymes. Long RSH-type enzymes encompass an N-terminal domain (NTD) harboring the second messenger nucleotide (p)ppGpp hydrolase and synthetase activity and a stress-perceiving and regulatory C-terminal domain (CTD). CTD-mediated binding of Rel to stalled ribosomes boosts (p)ppGpp synthesis. However, how the opposing activities of the NTD are controlled in the absence of stress was poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate on the RSH-type protein Rel that the critical regulative elements reside within the TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT) subdomain of the CTD, which associates to and represses the synthetase to concomitantly allow for activation of the hydrolase. Furthermore, we show that Rel forms homodimers, which appear to control the interaction with deacylated-tRNA, but not the enzymatic activity of Rel. Collectively, our study provides a detailed molecular view into the mechanism of stringent response repression in the absence of stress."	0
"32620552"	"Phosphorylation on Ser-359 of the α2 subunit in GABA type A receptors down-regulates their density at inhibitory synapses.GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) mediate fast synaptic inhibition and are trafficked to functionally diverse synapses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition. The MS data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange, with the data set identifier PXD019597."	1

Chromosome 3q26 copy number gain (CNG) is a genetic hallmark of LSCC present in >90% of tumors. We report that 3q26 CNGs occur early in LSCC tumorigenesis, persist during tumor progression, and drive coordinate overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2. Overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 in the context of Trp53 loss is sufficient to transform mouse lung basal stem cells into tumors with histological and genomic features of LSCC. Functionally, PRKCI and SOX2 collaborate to activate an extensive transcriptional program that enforces a lineage-restricted LSCC phenotype, whereas PRKCI and ECT2 collaborate to promote oncogenic growth. Gene signatures indicative of PKCι-SOX2 and PKCι-ECT2 signaling activity are enriched in the classical subtype of human LSCC and predict distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, the PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 oncogenes represent a multigenic driver of LSCC."	0
"32755593"	"The Dynamics of Transcriptional Activation by Hepatic Reprogramming Factors.Specific combinations of two transcription factors (Hnf4α plus Foxa1, Foxa2, or Foxa3) can induce direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic reprogramming are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Foxa protein family members and Hnf4α sequentially and cooperatively bind to chromatin to activate liver-specific gene expression. Although all Foxa proteins bind to and open regions of closed chromatin as pioneer factors, Foxa3 has the unique potential of transferring from the distal to proximal regions of the transcription start site of target genes, binding RNA polymerase II, and co-traversing target genes. These distinctive characteristics of Foxa3 are essential for inducing the hepatic fate in fibroblasts. Similar functional coupling of transcription factors to RNA polymerase II may occur in other contexts whereby transcriptional activation can induce cell differentiation."	0
"32433955"	"Optogenetic Activation of Striatopallidal Neurons Reveals Altered HCN Gating in DYT1 Dystonia.Firing activity of external globus pallidus (GPe) is crucial for motor control and is severely perturbed in dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions. Here, we show that GPe projection neurons exhibit a reduction of firing frequency and an irregular pattern in a DYT1 dystonia model. Optogenetic activation of the striatopallidal pathway fails to reset pacemaking activity of GPe neurons in mutant mice. Abnormal firing is paralleled by alterations in motor learning. We find that loss of dopamine D2 receptor-dependent inhibition causes increased GABA input at striatopallidal synapses, with subsequent downregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. Accordingly, enhancing in vivo HCN channel activity or blocking GABA release restores both the ability of striatopallidal inputs to pause ongoing GPe activity and motor coordination deficits. Our findings demonstrate an impaired striatopallidal connectivity, supporting the central role of GPe in motor control and, more importantly, identifying potential pharmacological targets for dystonia."	0

However, it remains largely unknown how mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) is established and stably propagated during cell division. In this study, we found that the proteins RYBP and YAF2 each specifically bind H2AK119ub1 to recruit the RYBP-PRC1 or YAF2-PRC1 complex to catalyse the ubiquitination of H2A on neighbouring nucleosomes through a positive-feedback model. Additionally, we demonstrated that histone H1-compacted chromatin enhances the distal propagation of H2AK119ub1, thereby reinforcing the inheritance of H2AK119ub1 during cell division. Moreover, we showed that either disruption of RYBP/YAF2-PRC1 activity or impairment of histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction resulted in a significant defect of the maintenance of H2AK119ub1. Therefore, our results suggest that histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction plays a critical role in the stable propagation of H2AK119ub1 by RYBP/YAF2-PRC1 during cell division."	0
"32160536"	"Retino-Cortical Mapping Ratio Predicts Columnar and Salt-and-Pepper Organization in Mammalian Visual Cortex.In the mammalian primary visual cortex, neural tuning to stimulus orientation is organized in either columnar or salt-and-pepper patterns across species. For decades, this sharp contrast has spawned fundamental questions about the origin of functional architectures in visual cortex. However, it is unknown whether these patterns reflect disparate developmental mechanisms across mammalian taxa or simply originate from variation of biological parameters under a universal development process. In this work, after the analysis of data from eight mammalian species, we show that cortical organization is predictable by a single factor, the retino-cortical mapping ratio. Groups of species with or without columnar clustering are distinguished by the feedforward sampling ratio, and model simulations with controlled mapping conditions reproduce both types of organization. Prediction from the Nyquist theorem explains this parametric division of the patterns with high accuracy. Our results imply that evolutionary variation of physical parameters may induce development of distinct functional circuitry."	0

The inflammasome assembled by NLRP3 has been predominantly studied in homogeneous cell populations in vitro, neglecting the influence of cellular interactions that occur in vivo. Here, we show that platelets boost the inflammasome capacity of human macrophages and neutrophils and are critical for IL-1 production by monocytes. Platelets license NLRP3 transcription, thereby enhancing ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activity, and IL-1β secretion. Platelets influence IL-1β production in vivo, and blood platelet counts correlate with plasmatic IL-1β levels in malaria. Furthermore, we reveal an enriched platelet gene signature among the highest-expressed transcripts in IL-1β-driven autoinflammatory diseases. The platelet effect is independent of cell-to-cell contact, platelet-derived lipid mediators, purines, nucleic acids, and a host of platelet cytokines, and it involves the triggering of calcium-sensing receptors on macrophages. Hence, platelets provide an additional layer of regulation of inflammasomes and IL-1-driven inflammation."	0

Promoting brown-like features in WAT has been an attractive therapeutic approach for obesity. However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p) catalyzes N-α-acetylation of nascent proteins, and overexpression of human Naa10p is linked to cancer development. Here, we report that both conventional and adipose-specific Naa10p deletions in mice result in increased energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and beige adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Naa10p acetylates the N terminus of Pgc1α, which prevents Pgc1α from interacting with Pparγ to activate key genes, such as Ucp1, involved in beige adipocyte function. Consistently, fat tissues of obese human individuals show higher NAA10 expression.

"31628042"	"PTPS Facilitates Compartmentalized LTBP1 S-Nitrosylation and Promotes Tumor Growth under Hypoxia.GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR) are sequentially responsible for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a known co-factor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The implication of BH4-biosynthesis process in tumorigenesis remains to be investigated. Here, we show that PTPS, which is highly expressed in early-stage colorectal cancer, is phosphorylated at Thr 58 by AMPK under hypoxia; this phosphorylation promotes PTPS binding to LTBP1 and subsequently drives iNOS-mediated LTBP1 S-nitrosylation through proximal-coupling BH4 production within the PTPS/iNOS/LTBP1 complex. In turn, LTBP1 S-nitrosylation results in proteasome-dependent LTBP1 protein degradation, revealing an inverse relationship between PTPS pT58 and LTBP1 stability. Physiologically, the repressive effect of PTPS on LTBP1 leads to impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and thereby maintains tumor cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LTBP1-TGF-β signaling by the BH4-biosynthesis pathway and highlight the specific requirement of PTPS for tumor growth."	1

NPCs have a limited lifespan and are depleted near the time of birth. Epigenetic factors are implicated in the maintenance of organ-restricted progenitors such as NPCs, but the chromatin-based mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, using a combination of gene targeting, chromatin profiling, and single-cell RNA analysis, we examined the role of the murine histone 3 Lys-27 (H3K27) methyltransferases EZH1 (enhancer of zeste 1) and EZH2 in NPC maintenance. We found that EZH2 expression correlates with NPC growth potential and that EZH2 is the dominant H3K27 methyltransferase in NPCs and epithelial descendants. Surprisingly, NPCs lacking H3K27 trimethylation maintained their progenitor state but cycled slowly, leading to a smaller NPC pool and formation of fewer nephrons. Unlike <i>Ezh2</i> loss of function, dual inactivation of <i>Ezh1</i> and <i>Ezh2</i> triggered overexpression of the transcriptional repressor Hes-related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1 (<i>Hey1</i>), down-regulation of <i>Six2</i>, and unscheduled activation of Wnt4-driven differentiation, resulting in early termination of nephrogenesis and severe renal dysgenesis. Double-mutant NPCs also overexpressed the SIX family member <i>Six1</i> However, in this context, SIX1 failed to maintain NPC stemness. At the chromatin level, EZH1 and EZH2 restricted accessibility to AP-1-binding motifs, and their absence promoted a regulatory landscape akin to differentiated and nonlineage cells. We conclude that EZH2 is required for NPC renewal potential and that tempering of the differentiation program requires cooperation of both EZH1 and EZH2."	0

Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction and concomitant metabolic reprogramming of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reduce the assembly and activity of the 26S proteasome. Both mitochondrial mutations in respiratory complex I and treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin impair 26S proteasome activity. Defective 26S assembly is reversible and can be overcome by supplementation of aspartate or pyruvate. This metabolic regulation of 26S activity involves specific regulation of proteasome assembly factors via the mTORC1 pathway. Of note, reducing 26S activity by metformin confers increased resistance toward the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is reversible upon pyruvate supplementation.

We report the structure of vesicular stomatitis virus L in complex with its P cofactor determined by electron cryomicroscopy at 3.0 Å resolution, enabling us to visualize bound segments of P. The contacts of three P segments with multiple L domains show how P induces a closed, compact, initiation-competent conformation. Binding of P to L positions its N-terminal domain adjacent to a putative RNA exit channel for efficient encapsidation of newly synthesized genomes with the nucleoprotein and orients its C-terminal domain to interact with an RNP template.

Disruption of autophagy in CySCs and early cyst cells (CCs) by the depletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes reduced early CC numbers and affected CC function, resembling decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling.

We further established that protein aggresome-a collection of endogenous protein aggregates-is an important indicator of bacterial dormancy depth, whose formation is promoted by decreased cellular ATP level.

We revealed that the ability to recruit functional DnaK-ClpB machineries, which facilitate protein disaggregation in an ATP-dependent manner, determines the lag time for bacterial regrowth. Better understanding of the key factors regulating bacterial regrowth after surviving antibiotic attack could lead to new therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial antibiotic tolerance."	0

Two-dimensional gel analysis reveals that replication of telomeres is severely impaired and correlates with an accumulation of replication intermediates that arises from stalled and collapsed forks. In the absence of telomerase, Rad51, Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, and its co-factor CtIP<sup>Ctp1</sup> become critical to maintain telomeres, indicating that homologous recombination processes these intermediates to facilitate fork restart.

Here, we used a mutant version of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS (TFIIS<sub>mut</sub>), aiming to specifically induce increased levels of RNAPII pausing, arrest, and/or backtracking in human cells. Indeed, TFIIS<sub>mut</sub> expression results in slower elongation rates, relative depletion of polymerases from the end of genes, and increased levels of stopped RNAPII; it affects mRNA splicing and termination as well. Remarkably, TFIIS<sub>mut</sub> expression also dramatically increases R-loops, which may form at the anterior end of backtracked RNAPII and trigger genome instability, including DNA strand breaks. These results shed light on the relationship between transcription stress and R-loops and suggest that different classes of R-loops may exist, potentially with distinct consequences for genome stability."	0
"32814053"	"Interactome Mapping Provides a Network of Neurodegenerative Disease Proteins and Uncovers Widespread Protein Aggregation in Affected Brains.Interactome maps are valuable resources to elucidate protein function and disease mechanisms. Here, we report on an interactome map that focuses on neurodegenerative disease (ND), connects ∼5,000 human proteins via ∼30,000 candidate interactions and is generated by systematic yeast two-hybrid interaction screening of ∼500 ND-related proteins and integration of literature interactions. This network reveals interconnectivity across diseases and links many known ND-causing proteins, such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and ATXN1, to a host of proteins previously unrelated to NDs. It facilitates the identification of interacting proteins that significantly influence mutant TDP-43 and HTT toxicity in transgenic flies, as well as of ARF-GEP<sub>100</sub> that controls misfolding and aggregation of multiple ND-causing proteins in experimental model systems. Furthermore, it enables the prediction of ND-specific subnetworks and the identification of proteins, such as ATXN1 and MKL1, that are abnormally aggregated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting widespread protein aggregation in NDs."	0
"32603710"	"The Histone Chaperone FACT Induces Cas9 Multi-turnover Behavior and Modifies Genome Manipulation in Human Cells.Cas9 is a prokaryotic RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that binds substrates tightly in vitro but turns over rapidly when used to manipulate genomes in eukaryotic cells. Little is known about the factors responsible for dislodging Cas9 or how they influence genome engineering. Unbiased detection through proximity labeling of transient protein interactions in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extract identified the dimeric histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) as an interactor of substrate-bound Cas9. FACT is both necessary and sufficient to displace dCas9, and FACT immunodepletion converts Cas9's activity from multi-turnover to single turnover. In human cells, FACT depletion extends dCas9 residence times, delays genome editing, and alters the balance between indel formation and homology-directed repair. FACT knockdown also increases epigenetic marking by dCas9-based transcriptional effectors with a concomitant enhancement of transcriptional modulation. FACT thus shapes the intrinsic cellular response to Cas9-based genome manipulation most likely by determining Cas9 residence times."	0
"31784360"	"MeCP2 Represses Enhancers through Chromosome Topology-Associated DNA Methylation.The genomes of mammalian neurons contain uniquely high levels of non-CG DNA methylation that can be bound by the Rett syndrome protein, MeCP2, to regulate gene expression. How patterns of non-CG methylation are established in neurons and the mechanism by which this methylation works with MeCP2 to control gene expression is unclear. Here, we find that genes repressed by MeCP2 are often located within megabase-scale regions of high non-CG methylation that correspond with topologically associating domains of chromatin folding. MeCP2 represses enhancers found in these domains that are enriched for non-CG and CG methylation, with the strongest repression occurring for enhancers located within MeCP2-repressed genes. These alterations in enhancer activity provide a mechanism for how MeCP2 disruption in disease can lead to widespread changes in gene expression. Hence, we find that DNA topology can shape non-CG DNA methylation across the genome to dictate MeCP2-mediated enhancer regulation in the brain."	0

To explore DNA modifications that could influence visual function with age, we perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of purified mouse rod photoreceptors at four ages and identify 2,054 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We detect many DMRs during early stages of aging and in rod regulatory regions, and some of these cluster at chromosomal hotspots, especially on chromosome 10, which includes a longevity interactome. Integration of methylome to age-related transcriptome changes, chromatin signatures, and first-order protein-protein interactions uncover an enrichment of DMRs in altered pathways that are associated with rod function, aging, and energy metabolism. In concordance, we detect reduced basal mitochondrial respiration and increased fatty acid dependency with retinal age in ex vivo assays. Our study reveals age-dependent genomic and chromatin features susceptible to DNA methylation changes in rod photoreceptors and identifies a link between DNA methylation and energy metabolism in aging."	0

However, most patients are still not cured, underscoring the need for improved treatments and the possible development of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for improved immunotherapy. We previously showed that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/β is a central regulator of PD-1 expression, where GSK-3 inhibition down-regulates PD-1 and enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> cytolytic T cell (CTL) function, reducing viral infections and tumor growth. Here, we demonstrate that GSK-3 also negatively regulates Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 (LAG-3) expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. GSK-3 SMIs are more effective than LAG-3 blockade alone in suppressing B16 melanoma growth, while their combination resulted in enhanced tumor clearance. This was linked to increased expression of the transcription factor, Tbet, which bound the LAG-3 promoter, inhibiting its transcription, and to increased granzyme B and interferon-γ1 expression. Overall, we describe a small molecule approach to inhibit LAG-3, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity."	1

We develop an inducible mouse model for the sequential ablation of UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown and brite/beige adipocytes in adult mice. We demonstrate that activated brown adipocytes can increase systemic energy expenditure (EE) by 30%, while the contribution of brite/beige UCP1<sup>+</sup> cells is <5%. Notably, UCP1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes do not contribute to circulating FGF21 levels, either at room temperature or after cold exposure. We demonstrate that the FGF21-mediated effects on EE and glucose homeostasis are partially dependent on the presence of UCP1<sup>+</sup> cells, while the effect on weight loss is not. In conclusion, acute UCP1<sup>+</sup> cell deletion may be a useful model to study the impact of brown and brite/beige adipocytes on metabolism."	0

"32187546"	"β-Amyloid Clustering around ASC Fibrils Boosts Its Toxicity in Microglia.Alzheimer's disease is the world's most common neurodegenerative disorder. It is associated with neuroinflammation involving activation of microglia by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits. Based on previous studies showing apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) binding and cross-seeding extracellular Aβ, we investigate the propagation of ASC between primary microglia and the effects of ASC-Aβ composites on microglial inflammasomes and function. Indeed, ASC released by a pyroptotic cell can be functionally built into the neighboring microglia NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3) inflammasome. Compared with protein-only application, exposure to ASC-Aβ composites amplifies the proinflammatory response, resulting in pyroptotic cell death, setting free functional ASC and inducing a feedforward stimulating vicious cycle. Clustering around ASC fibrils also compromises clearance of Aβ by microglia. Together, these data enable a closer look at the turning point from acute to chronic Aβ-related neuroinflammation through formation of ASC-Aβ composites."	0
"30795893"	"Microscopy-Based Chromosome Conformation Capture Enables Simultaneous Visualization of Genome Organization and Transcription in Intact Organisms.Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized in multiple scales, from nucleosomes to chromosome territories. Recently, genome-wide methods identified an intermediate level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), that play key roles in transcriptional regulation. However, these methods cannot directly examine the interplay between transcriptional activation and chromosome architecture while maintaining spatial information. Here we present a multiplexed, sequential imaging approach (Hi-M) that permits simultaneous detection of chromosome organization and transcription in single nuclei. This allowed us to unveil the changes in 3D chromatin organization occurring upon transcriptional activation and homologous chromosome unpairing during awakening of the zygotic genome in intact Drosophila embryos. Excitingly, the ability of Hi-M to explore the multi-scale chromosome architecture with spatial resolution at different stages of development or during the cell cycle will be key to understanding the mechanisms and consequences of the 4D organization of the genome."	0

However, the glycosphingolipid synthases required for production of these ceramides have not been well-characterized. Here, we report the identification and characterization of glucuronosylceramide synthase (ceramide UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [Cer-GlcAT]) in Z<i>ymomonas mobilis</i>, a Gram-negative bacterium whose cellular membranes contain glucuronosylceramide. On comparing the gene sequences that encode the diacylglycerol GlcAT in bacteria and plants, we found a homologous gene that is widely distributed in the order <i>Sphingomonadales</i> in the <i>Z. mobilis</i> genome. We first cloned the gene and expressed it in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, followed by protein purification using nickel-Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Using the highly enriched enzyme, we observed that it has high glycosyltransferase activity with UDP-glucuronic acid and ceramide as sugar donor and acceptor substrate, respectively. Cer-GlcAT deletion resulted in a loss of glucuronosylceramide and increased the levels of ceramide phosphoglycerol, which was expressed in WT cells only at very low levels. Furthermore, we found sequences homologous to Cer-GlcAT in <i>Sphingobium yanoikuyae</i> and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, which have been reported to produce glucuronosylceramide and α-galactosylceramide, respectively. We expressed the two homologs of the <i>cer-glcat</i> gene in <i>E. coli</i> and found that each gene encodes Cer-GlcAT and Cer-galactosyltransferase, respectively. These results contribute to the understanding of the roles of bacterial glycosphingolipids in host-bacteria interactions and the function of bacterial glycosphingolipids in bacterial physiology."	0
"32719005"	"Structure of a collagen VI α3 chain VWA domain array: adaptability and functional implications of myopathy causing mutations.Collagen VI is a ubiquitous heterotrimeric protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that plays an essential role in the proper maintenance of skeletal muscle. Mutations in collagen VI lead to a spectrum of congenital myopathies, from the mild Bethlem myopathy to the severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Collagen VI contains only a short triple helix and consists primarily of von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains, protein-protein interaction modules found in a range of ECM proteins. Disease-causing mutations occur commonly in the VWA domains, and the second VWA domain of the α3 chain, the N2 domain, harbors several such mutations. Here, we investigate structure-function relationships of the N2 mutations to shed light on their possible myopathy mechanisms. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of N2, combined with monitoring secretion efficiency in cell culture of selected N2 single-domain mutants, finding that mutations located within the central core of the domain severely affect secretion efficiency. In longer α3 chain constructs, spanning N6-N3, small-angle X-ray scattering demonstrates that the tandem VWA array has a modular architecture and samples multiple conformations in solution. Single-particle EM confirmed the presence of multiple conformations. Structural adaptability appears intrinsic to the VWA domain region of collagen VI α3 and has implications for binding interactions and modulating stiffness within the ECM."	0
"32665399"	"Glycan analysis of human neutrophil granules implicates a maturation-dependent glycosylation machinery.Protein glycosylation is essential to trafficking and immune functions of human neutrophils. During granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, distinct neutrophil granules are successively formed. Distinct receptors and effector proteins, many of which are glycosylated, are targeted to each type of granule according to their time of expression, a process called ""targeting by timing."" Therefore, these granules are time capsules reflecting different times of maturation that can be used to understand the glycosylation process during granulopoiesis. Herein, neutrophil subcellular granules were fractionated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and <i>N</i>- and <i>O</i>-glycans present in each compartment were analyzed by LC-MS. We found abundant paucimannosidic <i>N</i>-glycans and lack of <i>O</i>-glycans in the early-formed azurophil granules, whereas the later-formed specific and gelatinase granules and secretory vesicles contained complex <i>N-</i> and <i>O-</i>glycans with remarkably elongated <i>N</i>-acetyllactosamine repeats with Lewis epitopes. Immunoblotting and histochemical analysis confirmed the expression of Lewis X and sialyl-Lewis X in the intracellular granules and on the cell surface, respectively. Many glycans identified are unique to neutrophils, and their complexity increased progressively from azurophil granules to specific granules and then to gelatinase granules, suggesting temporal changes in the glycosylation machinery indicative of ""glycosylation by timing"" during granulopoiesis. In summary, this comprehensive neutrophil granule glycome map, the first of its kind, highlights novel granule-specific glycosylation features and is a crucial first step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating protein glycosylation during neutrophil granulopoiesis and a more detailed understanding of neutrophil biology and function."	0
"32023464"	"Heterogeneity of Satellite Cells Implicates DELTA1/NOTCH2 Signaling in Self-Renewal.How satellite cells and their progenitors balance differentiation and self-renewal to achieve sustainable tissue regeneration is not well understood. A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty of studying this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identify the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity of satellite cells, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression, during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies, we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool. These findings have implications for therapeutic control of muscle regeneration."	0

Epa family members are lectins with binding pockets containing several conserved and variable structural hot spots, which were implicated in mediating functional diversity. In this study, we have performed an elaborate structure-based mutational analysis of numerous Epa paralogs to generally determine the role of diverse structural hot spots in conferring host cell binding and ligand binding specificity. Our study reveals that several conserved structural motifs contribute to efficient host cell binding. Moreover, our directed motif exchange experiments reveal that the variable loop CBL2 is key for programming ligand binding specificity, albeit with limited predictability. In contrast, we find that the variable loop L1 affects host cell binding without significantly influencing the specificity of ligand binding. Our data strongly suggest that variation of numerous structural hot spots in the ligand binding pocket of Epa proteins is a main driver of their functional diversification and evolution."	0

Yet the protein structure domains that allow TFs to target nucleosomal DNA remain unexplored. We screened diverse TFs for binding to nucleosomes containing motif-enriched sequences targeted by pioneer factors in vivo. FOXA1, OCT4, ASCL1/E12α, PU1, CEBPα, and ZELDA display a range of nucleosome binding affinities that correlate with their cell reprogramming potential. We further screened 593 full-length human TFs on protein microarrays against different nucleosome sequences, followed by confirmation in solution, to distinguish among factors that bound nucleosomes, such as the neuronal AP-2α/β/γ, versus factors that only bound free DNA. Structural comparisons of DNA binding domains revealed that efficient nucleosome binders use short anchoring α helices to bind DNA, whereas weak nucleosome binders use unstructured regions and/or β sheets. Thus, specific modes of DNA interaction allow nucleosome scanning that confers pioneer activity to transcription factors."	0
"32521271"	"TLR7 Sensing by Neutrophils Is Critical for the Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, where they kill invading pathogens. However, they may also act as early temporary shelters, favoring subsequent pathogen dissemination in the host. We find that TLR7 sensing of the protozoan Leishmania parasite in neutrophils is essential for early parasite load regulation. Neutrophil effector functions, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, are decreased in the absence of TLR7, resulting in higher parasite load and selective parasite replication in Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils. Leishmania-infected Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> mice develop a chronic unhealing lesion, despite Th1 cell differentiation, and we show that Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils alone mediate this effect. Conversely, topical treatment with a TLR7 agonist early in infection induces smaller lesion development than in untreated mice. Collectively, these findings highlight that parasite TLR7 triggering in neutrophils regulates early innate functions with major consequences on subsequent disease evolution, opening avenues for possible treatment strategies."	0
"32579944"	"Analysis of Genome Architecture during SCNT Reveals a Role of Cohesin in Impeding Minor ZGA.Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can reprogram a somatic nucleus to a totipotent state. However, the re-organization of 3D chromatin structure in this process remains poorly understood. Using low-input Hi-C, we revealed that, during SCNT, the transferred nucleus first enters a mitotic-like state (premature chromatin condensation). Unlike fertilized embryos, SCNT embryos show stronger topologically associating domains (TADs) at the 1-cell stage. TADs become weaker at the 2-cell stage, followed by gradual consolidation. Compartments A/B are markedly weak in 1-cell SCNT embryos and become increasingly strengthened afterward. By the 8-cell stage, somatic chromatin architecture is largely reset to embryonic patterns. Unexpectedly, we found cohesin represses minor zygotic genome activation (ZGA) genes (2-cell-specific genes) in pluripotent and differentiated cells, and pre-depleting cohesin in donor cells facilitates minor ZGA and SCNT. These data reveal multi-step reprogramming of 3D chromatin architecture during SCNT and support dual roles of cohesin in TAD formation and minor ZGA repression."	0

"32579942"	"Phenotypic Screen with TSC-Deficient Neurons Reveals Heat-Shock Machinery as a Druggable Pathway for mTORC1 and Reduced Cilia.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder that leads to elevated mechanistic targeting of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. Cilia can be affected by mTORC1 signaling, and ciliary deficits are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine whether neuronal cilia are affected in TSC. We show that cortical tubers from TSC patients and mutant mouse brains have fewer cilia. Using high-content image-based assays, we demonstrate that mTORC1 activity inversely correlates with ciliation in TSC1/2-deficient neurons. To investigate the mechanistic relationship between mTORC1 and cilia, we perform a phenotypic screen for mTORC1 inhibitors with TSC1/2-deficient neurons. We identify inhibitors of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) that suppress mTORC1 through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 rescues ciliation through downregulation of Hsp27. Our study uncovers the heat-shock machinery as a druggable signaling node to restore mTORC1 activity and cilia due to loss of TSC1/2, and it provides broadly applicable platforms for studying TSC-related neuronal dysfunction."	0

Here, we describe a mechanism of FBXL5 regulation involving its interaction with the cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex composed of MMS19, FAM96B, and CIAO1. We demonstrate that the CIA-targeting complex promotes the ability of FBXL5 to degrade IRPs. In addition, the FBXL5-CIA-targeting complex interaction is regulated by oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tension displaying a robust association in 21% O<sub>2</sub> that is severely diminished in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and contributes to O<sub>2</sub>-dependent regulation of IRP degradation.

However, the scope of RNA localization in bacteria remained unknown. Here, we report the distribution of the E. coli transcriptome between the membrane, cytoplasm, and poles by combining cell fractionation with deep-sequencing (Rloc-seq). Our results reveal asymmetric RNA distribution on a transcriptome-wide scale, significantly correlating with proteome localization and prevalence of translation-independent RNA localization. The poles are enriched with stress-related mRNAs and small RNAs, the latter becoming further enriched upon stress in an Hfq-dependent manner. Genome organization may play a role in localizing membrane protein-encoding transcripts.

Two features of the nascent transcript correlated with RNAPI distribution: folding energy and GC content in the transcription bubble. In vitro experiments confirmed that strong RNA structures close to the polymerase promote forward translocation and limit backtracking, whereas high GC in the transcription bubble slows elongation. A mathematical model for RNAPI elongation confirmed the importance of nascent RNA folding in transcription. RNAPI from S. pombe was similarly sensitive to transcript folding, as were S. cerevisiae RNAPII and RNAPIII. For RNAPII, unstructured RNA, which favors slowed elongation, was associated with faster cotranscriptional splicing and proximal splice site use, indicating regulatory significance for transcript folding."	0

We detect circadian rhythms both in vivo with transcriptional profiling and ex vivo by bioluminescence. High-resolution structural analysis of embryonic explants reveals that global or local clock disruption results in defects that resemble human congenital abnormalities of the kidney. The onset of fetal rhythms strongly correlates with the timing of a distinct transition in branching and growth rates during a gestational window of high fetal growth demands.

"30595434"	"Noncanonical Modulation of the eIF2 Pathway Controls an Increase in Local Translation during Neural Wiring.Local translation is rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but its control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the extracellular cue Sema3A induces an initial burst in local translation that precisely controls phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α via the unfolded protein response (UPR) kinase PERK. Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers. Finally, we show that PERK signaling is needed for directional axon migration and visual pathway development in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a noncanonical eIF2 signaling pathway that controls selective changes in axon translation and is required for neural wiring."	1
"30853401"	"Spatiotemporal Control of ULK1 Activation by NDP52 and TBK1 during Selective Autophagy.Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis."	1
"32187540"	"Dead Cells Induce Innate Anergy via Mertk after Acute Viral Infection.Infections can result in a temporarily restricted unresponsiveness of the innate immune response, thereby limiting pathogen control. Mechanisms of such unresponsiveness are well studied in lipopolysaccharide tolerance; however, whether mechanisms of tolerance limit innate immunity during virus infection remains unknown. Here, we find that infection with the highly cytopathic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) leads to innate anergy for several days. Innate anergy is associated with induction of apoptotic cells, which activates the Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) receptor Mertk and induces high levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Lack of Mertk in Mertk<sup>-/-</sup> mice prevents induction of IL-10 and TGF-β, resulting in abrogation of innate anergy. Innate anergy is associated with enhanced VSV replication and poor survival after infection. Mechanistically, Mertk signaling upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3. Dexamethasone treatment upregulates Mertk and enhances innate anergy in a Mertk-dependent manner. In conclusion, we identify Mertk as one major regulator of innate tolerance during infection with VSV."	0

In classical PRR, PCNA monoubiquitination recruits translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases that can replicate through lesions. We find that PRR responds to DNA replication stress that does not cause base lesions. Rad5 forms nuclear foci during normal S phase and after exposure to types of replication stress where DNA base lesions are likely absent. Rad5 binds to the sites of stressed DNA replication forks, where it recruits TLS polymerases to repair single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps, preventing mitotic defects and chromosome breaks. In contrast to the prevailing view of PRR, our data indicate that Rad5 promotes both mutagenic and error-free repair of undamaged ssDNA that arises during physiological and exogenous replication stress."	0
"31919192"	"Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 degradation regulates kinetochore composition in meiosis.The kinetochore complex is a conserved machinery that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules. During meiosis, the kinetochore is restructured to accommodate a specialized chromosome segregation pattern. In budding yeast, meiotic kinetochore remodeling is mediated by the temporal changes in the abundance of a single subunit called Ndc80. We previously described the regulatory events that control the timely synthesis of Ndc80. Here, we report that Ndc80 turnover is also tightly regulated in meiosis: Ndc80 degradation is active in meiotic prophase, but not in metaphase I. Ndc80 degradation depends on the ubiquitin ligase APC<sup>Ama1</sup> and is mediated by the proteasome. Importantly, Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation, a mark that has been previously implicated in correcting erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, is essential for Ndc80 degradation in a microtubule-independent manner. The N terminus of Ndc80, including a 27-residue sequence and Aurora B phosphorylation sites, is both necessary and sufficient for kinetochore protein degradation. Finally, defects in Ndc80 turnover predispose meiotic cells to chromosome mis-segregation. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which meiotic cells modulate their kinetochore composition through regulated Ndc80 degradation, and demonstrates that Aurora B-dependent regulation of kinetochores extends beyond altering microtubule attachments."	1

Here, we employ a fusion compound of the cytokine LIGHT and a vascular targeting peptide (LIGHT-VTP) that homes to angiogenic blood vessels in primary tumors. We show in primary mouse lung cancer that normalization of tumor vasculature by LIGHT-VTP prevents cancer cell intravasation. Further, LIGHT-VTP efficiently targets pathological blood vessels in the pre-metastatic niche, reducing vascular hyper-permeability and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thus blocking metastatic lung colonization. Moreover, we demonstrate that mouse and human metastatic melanoma deposits are targetable by VTP. In overt melanoma metastases, LIGHT-VTP normalizes intra-metastatic blood vessels and increases GrzB<sup>+</sup> effector T cells. Successful treatment induces high endothelial venules (HEVs) and lymphocyte clusters, which sensitize refractory lung metastases to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.

Germline null and adipocyte-specific conditional null mice show a light- and Opn3-dependent deficit in thermogenesis and become hypothermic upon cold exposure. We show that stimulating mouse adipocytes with blue light enhances the lipolysis response and, in particular, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase. This response is Opn3 dependent.

Despite the public availability of high-quality DNase-seq data from hundreds of samples, a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for the locations of genomic footprints is lacking. Here, we develop a scalable footprinting workflow using two state-of-the-art algorithms: Wellington and HINT. We apply our workflow to detect footprints in 192 ENCODE DNase-seq experiments and predict the genomic occupancy of 1,515 human TFs in 27 human tissues. We validate that these footprints overlap true-positive TF binding sites from ChIP-seq. We demonstrate that the locations, depth, and tissue specificity of footprints predict effects of genetic variants on gene expression and capture a substantial proportion of genetic risk for complex traits."	0
"30704899"	"Pacer Is a Mediator of mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 Signaling in Regulation of Autophagosome Maturation and Lipid Metabolism.mTORC1 and GSK3 play critical roles in early stages of (macro)autophagy, but how they regulate late steps of autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 signaling converge to modulate autophagosome maturation through Pacer, an autophagy regulator that was identified in our recent study. Hepatocyte-specific Pacer knockout in mice results in impaired autophagy flux, glycogen and lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates Pacer at serine157 to disrupt the association of Pacer with Stx17 and the HOPS complex and thus abolishes Pacer-mediated autophagosome maturation. Importantly, dephosphorylation of Pacer under nutrient-deprived conditions promotes TIP60-mediated Pacer acetylation, which facilitates HOPS complex recruitment and is required for autophagosome maturation and lipid droplet clearance. This work not only identifies Pacer as a regulator in hepatic autophagy and liver homeostasis in vivo but also reveals a signal integration mechanism involved in late stages of autophagy and lipid metabolism."	1

The generated cA<sub>n</sub> second messenger in turn targets the CARF domain of trans-acting RNase Csm6, triggering its HEPN domain-based RNase activity. We have undertaken cryo-EM studies on multi-subunit Thermococcus onnurineus Csm effector ternary complexes, as well as X-ray studies on Csm1-Csm4 cassette, both bound to substrate (AMPPNP), intermediates (pppA<sub>n</sub>), and products (cA<sub>n</sub>), to decipher mechanistic aspects of cA<sub>n</sub> formation and release. A network of intermolecular hydrogen bond alignments accounts for the observed adenosine specificity, with ligand positioning dictating formation of linear pppA<sub>n</sub> intermediates and subsequent cA<sub>n</sub> formation by cyclization. We combine our structural results with published functional studies to highlight mechanistic insights into the role of the Csm effector complex in mediating the cA<sub>n</sub> signaling pathway."	0
"30735654"	"R-Loops as Cellular Regulators and Genomic Threats.During transcription, the nascent RNA strand can base pair with its template DNA, displacing the non-template strand as ssDNA and forming a structure called an R-loop. R-loops are common across many domains of life and cause DNA damage in certain contexts. In this review, we summarize recent results implicating R-loops as important regulators of cellular processes such as transcription termination, gene regulation, and DNA repair. We also highlight recent work suggesting that R-loops can be problematic to cells as blocks to efficient transcription and replication that trigger the DNA damage response. Finally, we discuss how R-loops may contribute to cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory diseases and compare the available next-generation sequencing-based approaches to map R-loops genome wide."	0
"31805522"	"Fork pausing complex engages topoisomerases at the replisome.Replication forks temporarily or terminally pause at hundreds of hard-to-replicate regions around the genome. A conserved pair of budding yeast replisome components Tof1-Csm3 (fission yeast Swi1-Swi3 and human TIMELESS-TIPIN) act as a ""molecular brake"" and promote fork slowdown at proteinaceous replication fork barriers (RFBs), while the accessory helicase Rrm3 assists the replisome in removing protein obstacles. Here we show that the Tof1-Csm3 complex promotes fork pausing independently of Rrm3 helicase by recruiting topoisomerase I (Top1) to the replisome. Topoisomerase II (Top2) partially compensates for the pausing decrease in cells when Top1 is lost from the replisome. The C terminus of Tof1 is specifically required for Top1 recruitment to the replisome and fork pausing but not for DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) activation. We propose that forks pause at proteinaceous RFBs through a ""sTOP"" mechanism (""slowing down with topoisomerases I-II""), which we show also contributes to protecting cells from topoisomerase-blocking agents."	0
"31375262"	"Heterozygous Mutations in SMARCA2 Reprogram the Enhancer Landscape by Global Retargeting of SMARCA4.Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complexes associated with an ATPase (either SMARCA4 or SMARCA2). Heterozygous mutations in the SMARCA2 ATPase cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), an intellectual disability syndrome associated with delayed speech onset. We engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to carry NCBRS-associated heterozygous SMARCA2 K755R or R1159Q mutations. While SMARCA2 mutant hESCs were phenotypically normal, differentiation to neural progenitors cells (NPCs) was severely impaired. We find that SMARCA2 mutations cause enhancer reorganization with loss of SOX3-dependent neural enhancers and prominent emergence of astrocyte-specific de novo enhancers. Changes in chromatin accessibility at enhancers were associated with an increase in SMARCA2 binding and retargeting of SMARCA4. We show that the AP-1 family member FRA2 is aberrantly overexpressed in SMARCA2 mutant NPCs, where it functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers. Together, our results demonstrate that SMARCA2 mutations cause impaired differentiation through enhancer reprogramming via inappropriate targeting of SMARCA4."	0

While heterogeneity between individual patients is known to affect the efficacy of cancer therapy, most personalized treatment approaches do not account for intratumour heterogeneity. We addressed this issue by studying the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas by single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptome-informed flow cytometry. We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subpopulations and compared their drug-response and genomic profiles. Malignant subpopulations from the same patient responded strikingly differently to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subpopulation-specific drug sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-malignant cells, whose gene-expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the frequencies of T-cell subsets varied significantly between the donors. Our data provide insights into the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas and highlight the relevance of intratumour heterogeneity for personalized cancer therapy."	0
"31914391"	"SETDB1-Mediated Cell Fate Transition between 2C-Like and Pluripotent States.Known as a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, SETDB1 is essential for embryonic development and pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) establishment. However, its function in pluripotency regulation remains elusive. In this study, we find that under the ""ground state"" of pluripotency with two inhibitors (2i) of the MEK and GSK3 pathways, Setdb1-knockout fails to induce trophectoderm (TE) differentiation as in serum/LIF (SL), indicating that TE fate restriction is not the direct target of SETDB1. In both conditions, Setdb1-knockout activates a group of genes targeted by SETDB1-mediated H3K9 methylation, including Dux. Notably, Dux is indispensable for the reactivation of 2C-like state genes upon Setdb1 deficiency, delineating the mechanistic role of SETDB1 in totipotency restriction. Furthermore, Setdb1-null ESCs maintain pluripotent marker (e.g., Nanog) expression in the 2i condition. This ""ground state"" Setdb1-null population undergoes rapid cell death by activating Ripk3 and, subsequently, RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. These results reveal the essential role of Setdb1 between totipotency and pluripotency transition."	0
"32610121"	"Adipocyte-Derived Versican and Macrophage-Derived Biglycan Control Adipose Tissue Inflammation in Obesity.Obesity is characterized by adipose tissue inflammation. Because proteoglycans regulate inflammation, here we investigate their role in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. We find that adipose tissue versican and biglycan increase in obesity. Versican is produced mainly by adipocytes and biglycan by adipose tissue macrophages. Both proteoglycans are also present in adipose tissue from obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Deletion of adipocyte-specific versican or macrophage-specific biglycan in mice reduces macrophage accumulation and chemokine and cytokine expression, although only adipocyte-specific versican deletion leads to sustained improvement in glucose tolerance. Macrophage-derived biglycan activates inflammatory genes in adipocytes. Versican expression increases in cultured adipocytes exposed to excess glucose, and adipocyte-conditioned medium stimulates inflammation in resident peritoneal macrophages, in part because of a versican breakdown product, versikine. These findings provide insights into the role of adipocyte- and macrophage-derived proteoglycans in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity."	0
"30853402"	"The Cargo Receptor NDP52 Initiates Selective Autophagy by Recruiting the ULK Complex to Cytosol-Invading Bacteria.Xenophagy, a selective autophagy pathway that protects the cytosol against bacterial invasion, relies on cargo receptors that juxtapose bacteria and phagophore membranes. Whether phagophores are recruited from a constitutive pool or are generated de novo at prospective cargo remains unknown. Phagophore formation in situ would require recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery to prospective cargo. Here, we show that, essential for anti-bacterial autophagy, the cargo receptor NDP52 forms a trimeric complex with FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1, which are subunits of the autophagy-initiating ULK and the TBK1 kinase complex, respectively. FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1 are each recruited independently to bacteria via NDP52, as revealed by selective point mutations in their respective binding sites, but only in their combined presence does xenophagy proceed. Such recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery by NDP52 reveals how detection of cargo-associated ""eat me"" signals, induction of autophagy, and juxtaposition of cargo and phagophores are integrated in higher eukaryotes."	1
"32499403"	"Dynamic regulation of histone modifications and long-range chromosomal interactions during postmitotic transcriptional reactivation.During mitosis, transcription of genomic DNA is dramatically reduced, before it is reactivated during nuclear reformation in anaphase/telophase. Many aspects of the underlying principles that mediate transcriptional memory and reactivation in the daughter cells remain unclear. Here, we used ChIP-seq on synchronized cells at different stages after mitosis to generate genome-wide maps of histone modifications. Combined with EU-RNA-seq and Hi-C analyses, we found that during prometaphase, promoters, enhancers, and insulators retain H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, while losing H3K27ac. Enhancers globally retaining mitotic H3K4me1 or locally retaining mitotic H3K27ac are associated with cell type-specific genes and their transcription factors for rapid transcriptional activation. As cells exit mitosis, promoters regain H3K27ac, which correlates with transcriptional reactivation. Insulators also gain H3K27ac and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in anaphase/telophase. This increase of H3K27ac in anaphase/telophase is required for posttranscriptional activation and may play a role in the establishment of topologically associating domains (TADs). Together, our results suggest that the genome is reorganized in a sequential order, in which histone methylations occur first in prometaphase, histone acetylation, and CTCF in anaphase/telophase, transcription in cytokinesis, and long-range chromatin interactions in early G1. We thus provide insights into the histone modification landscape that allows faithful reestablishment of the transcriptional program and TADs during cell division."	0
"32877682"	"Heterogeneity of Antiviral Responses in the Upper Respiratory Tract Mediates Differential Non-lytic Clearance of Influenza Viruses.Influenza viruses initiate infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT), but early viral tropism and the importance of cell-type-specific antiviral responses in this tissue remain incompletely understood. By infecting transgenic lox-stop-lox reporter mice with a Cre-recombinase-expressing influenza B virus, we identify olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as a major viral cell target in the URT. These cells become infected, then eliminate the virus and survive in the host post-resolution of infection. OSN responses to infection are characterized by a strong induction of interferon-stimulated genes and more rapid clearance of viral protein relative to other cells in the epithelium. We speculate that this cell-type-specific response likely serves to protect the central nervous system from infection. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of evaluating antiviral responses across different cell types, even those within the same tissue, to more fully understand the mechanisms of viral disease."	0
"31178353"	"3' Uridylation Confers miRNAs with Non-canonical Target Repertoires.Many microRNAs (miRNAs) exist alongside abundant miRNA isoforms (isomiRs), most of which arise from post-maturation sequence modifications such as 3' uridylation. However, the ways in which these sequence modifications affect miRNA function remain poorly understood. Here, using human miR-27a in cell lines as a model, we discovered that a nonfunctional target site unable to base-pair extensively with the miRNA seed sequence can regain function when an upstream adenosine is able to base-pair with a post-transcriptionally added uridine in the miR-27a tail. This tail-U-mediated repression (TUMR) is abolished in cells lacking the uridylation enzymes TUT4 and TUT7, indicating that uridylation alters miRNA function by modulating target recognition. We identified a set of non-canonical targets in human cells that are specifically regulated by uridylated miR-27a. We provide evidence that TUMR expands the targets of other endogenous miRNAs. Our study reveals a function of uridylated isomiRs in regulating non-canonical miRNA targets."	0

Here we apply this approach to the brain and successfully repair a guanosine-to-adenosine mutation in methyl CpG binding protein 2 RNA that causes the neurodevelopmental disease Rett syndrome. Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2<sup>317G>A</sup> mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less. This study demonstrates that programmable RNA editing can be utilized to repair mutations in mouse models of neurological disease."	0
"32187555"	"Cancer Cells Resist Mechanical Destruction in Circulation via RhoA/Actomyosin-Dependent Mechano-Adaptation.During metastasis, cancer cells are exposed to potentially destructive hemodynamic forces including fluid shear stress (FSS) while en route to distant sites. However, prior work indicates that cancer cells are more resistant to brief pulses of high-level FSS in vitro relative to non-transformed epithelial cells. Herein, we identify a mechano-adaptive mechanism of FSS resistance in cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that cancer cells activate RhoA in response to FSS, which protects them from FSS-induced plasma membrane damage. We show that cancer cells freshly isolated from mouse and human tumors are resistant to FSS, that formin and myosin II activity protects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from destruction, and that short-term inhibition of myosin II delays metastasis in mouse models. Collectively, our data indicate that viable CTCs actively resist destruction by hemodynamic forces and are likely to be more mechanically robust than is commonly thought."	0

"30846318"	"Probing the Global Cellular Responses to Lipotoxicity Caused by Saturated Fatty Acids.Excessive levels of saturated fatty acids are toxic to cells, although the basis for this lipotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity."	0
"30905508"	"Cut-and-Run: A Distinct Mechanism by which V(D)J Recombination Causes Genome Instability.V(D)J recombination is essential to generate antigen receptor diversity but is also a potent cause of genome instability. Many chromosome alterations that result from aberrant V(D)J recombination involve breaks at single recombination signal sequences (RSSs). A long-standing question, however, is how such breaks occur. Here, we show that the genomic DNA that is excised during recombination, the excised signal circle (ESC), forms a complex with the recombinase proteins to efficiently catalyze breaks at single RSSs both in vitro and in vivo. Following cutting, the RSS is released while the ESC-recombinase complex remains intact to potentially trigger breaks at further RSSs. Consistent with this, chromosome breaks at RSSs increase markedly in the presence of the ESC. Notably, these breaks co-localize with those found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and occur at key cancer driver genes. We have named this reaction ""cut-and-run"" and suggest that it could be a significant cause of lymphocyte genome instability."	0
"32492417"	"Epigenetic Reprogramming of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Deregulates Glucose Metabolism and Facilitates Progression of Breast Cancer.The mechanistic contributions of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in breast cancer progression remain to be fully understood. While altered glucose metabolism in CAFs could fuel cancer cells, how such metabolic reprogramming emerges and is sustained needs further investigation. Studying fibroblasts isolated from patients with benign breast tissues and breast cancer, in conjunction with multiple animal models, we demonstrate that CAFs exhibit a metabolic shift toward lactate and pyruvate production and fuel biosynthetic pathways of cancer cells. The depletion or suppression of the lactate production of CAFs alter the tumor metabolic profile and impede tumor growth. The glycolytic phenotype of the CAFs is in part sustained through epigenetic reprogramming of HIF-1α and glycolytic enzymes. Hypoxia induces epigenetic reprogramming of normal fibroblasts, resulting in a pro-glycolytic, CAF-like transcriptome. Our findings suggest that the glucose metabolism of CAFs evolves during tumor progression, and their breast cancer-promoting phenotype is partly mediated by oxygen-dependent epigenetic modifications."	0
"30952515"	"Interleukin-1β Induces mtDNA Release to Activate Innate Immune Signaling via cGAS-STING.Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammation and is produced in response to a wide range of stimuli. During infection, IL-1β production occurs in parallel with the onset of innate antimicrobial defenses, but the contribution of IL-1β signaling to cell-intrinsic immunity is not defined. Here, we report that exogenous IL-1β induces interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation in human myeloid, fibroblast, and epithelial cells. IRF3 activation by IL-1β is dependent upon the DNA-sensing pathway adaptor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), through the recognition of cytosolic mtDNA by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS). IL-1β treatment results in interferon (IFN) production and activation of IFN signaling to direct a potent innate immune response that restricts dengue virus infection. This study identifies a new function for IL-1β in the onset or enhancement of cell-intrinsic immunity, with important implications for cGAS-STING in integrating inflammatory and microbial cues for host defense."	1

This requires a high degree of morphological and therefore cytoskeletal plasticity. Here, we use the exceptional genetics and in vivo imaging of Drosophila embryos to study macrophage phagocytic versatility during apoptotic corpse clearance. We find that macrophage phagocytosis is highly robust, arising from their possession of two distinct modes of engulfment that utilize exclusive suites of actin-regulatory proteins. ""Lamellipodial phagocytosis"" is Arp2/3-complex-dependent and allows cells to migrate toward and envelop apoptotic corpses. Alternatively, Diaphanous and Ena drive filopodial phagocytosis to reach out and draw in debris.

"31677973"	"The Nuclear Matrix Protein SAFB Cooperates with Major Satellite RNAs to Stabilize Heterochromatin Architecture Partially through Phase Separation.Interphase chromatin is hierarchically organized into higher-order architectures that are essential for gene functions, yet the biomolecules that regulate these 3D architectures remain poorly understood. Here, we show that scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB), a nuclear matrix (NM)-associated protein with RNA-binding functions, modulates chromatin condensation and stabilizes heterochromatin foci in mouse cells. SAFB interacts via its R/G-rich region with heterochromatin-associated repeat transcripts such as major satellite RNAs, which promote the phase separation driven by SAFB. Depletion of SAFB leads to changes in 3D genome organization, including an increase in interchromosomal interactions adjacent to pericentromeric heterochromatin and a decrease in genomic compartmentalization, which could result from the decondensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Collectively, we reveal the integrated roles of NM-associated proteins and repeat RNAs in the 3D organization of heterochromatin, which may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of nuclear architecture organization."	0
"32571876"	"5'-UTR recruitment of the translation initiation factor eIF4GI or DAP5 drives cap-independent translation of a subset of human mRNAs.During unfavorable conditions (<i>e.g.</i> tumor hypoxia or viral infection), canonical, cap-dependent mRNA translation is suppressed in human cells. Nonetheless, a subset of physiologically important mRNAs (<i>e.g.</i> hypoxia-inducible factor 1α [HIF-1α], fibroblast growth factor 9 [FGF-9], and p53) is still translated by an unknown, cap-independent mechanism. Additionally, expression levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) and of its homolog, death-associated protein 5 (DAP5), are elevated. By examining the 5' UTRs of HIF-1α, FGF-9, and p53 mRNAs and using fluorescence anisotropy binding studies, luciferase reporter-based <i>in vitro</i> translation assays, and mutational analyses, we demonstrate here that eIF4GI and DAP5 specifically bind to the 5' UTRs of these cap-independently translated mRNAs. Surprisingly, we found that the eIF4E-binding domain of eIF4GI increases not only the binding affinity but also the selectivity among these mRNAs. We further demonstrate that the affinities of eIF4GI and DAP5 binding to these 5' UTRs correlate with the efficiency with which these factors drive cap-independent translation of these mRNAs. Integrating the results of our binding and translation assays, we conclude that eIF4GI or DAP5 is critical for recruitment of a specific subset of mRNAs to the ribosome, providing mechanistic insight into their cap-independent translation."	0
"32937136"	"PRC2 Acts as a Critical Timer That Drives Oligodendrocyte Fate over Astrocyte Identity by Repressing the Notch Pathway.PRC2 creates the repressive mark histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation. Although PRC2 is involved in various biological processes, its role in glial development remains ambiguous. Here, we show that PRC2 is required for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, but not for OL precursor formation. PRC2-deficient OL lineage cells differentiate into OL precursors, but they fail to trigger the molecular program for myelination, highlighting that PRC2 is essential for directing the differentiation timing of OL precursors. PRC2 null OL lineage cells aberrantly induce Notch pathway genes and acquire astrocytic features. The repression of the Notch pathway restores the myelination program and inhibits abnormal astrocytic differentiation in the PRC2-deficient OL lineage, indicating that Notch is a major target of PRC2. Altogether, our studies propose a specific action of PRC2 as a novel gatekeeper that determines the glial fate choice and the timing of OL lineage progression and myelination by impinging on the Notch pathway."	0

These Fds are thought to redirect the energy harvested from light to phage-encoded oxidoreductases that enhance viral fitness, but it is unclear how the biophysical properties and partner specificities of phage Fds relate to those of photosynthetic organisms. Here, results of a bioinformatics analysis using a sequence similarity network revealed that phage Fds are most closely related to cyanobacterial Fds that transfer electrons from photosystems to oxidoreductases involved in nutrient assimilation. Structural analysis of myovirus P-SSM2 Fd (pssm2-Fd), which infects the cyanobacterium <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i>, revealed high levels of similarity to cyanobacterial Fds (root mean square deviations of ≤0.5 Å). Additionally, pssm2-Fd exhibited a low midpoint reduction potential (-336 mV <i>versus</i> a standard hydrogen electrode), similar to other photosynthetic Fds, although it had lower thermostability (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i> = 28 °C) than did many other Fds. When expressed in an <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain deficient in sulfite assimilation, pssm2-Fd complemented bacterial growth when coexpressed with a <i>P. marinus</i> sulfite reductase, revealing that pssm2-Fd can transfer electrons to a host protein involved in nutrient assimilation. The high levels of structural similarity with cyanobacterial Fds and reactivity with a host sulfite reductase suggest that phage Fds evolved to transfer electrons to cyanobacterially encoded oxidoreductases."	0

However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival. These results reveal that precise regulation of UHRF1 acetylation is required to maintain DNA methylation during cell division and control cell survival."	1

"31940486"	"Vesicle Shrinking and Enlargement Play Opposing Roles in the Release of Exocytotic Contents.For decades, two fusion modes were thought to control hormone and transmitter release essential to life; one facilitates release via fusion pore dilation and flattening (full collapse), and the other limits release by closing a narrow fusion pore (kiss-and-run). Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to visualize fusion modes of dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells, we find that facilitation of release is mediated not by full collapse but by shrink fusion, in which the Ω-profile generated by vesicle fusion shrinks but maintains a large non-dilating pore. We discover that the physiological osmotic pressure of a cell squeezes, but does not dilate, the Ω-profile, which explains why shrink fusion prevails over full collapse. Instead of kiss-and-run, enlarge fusion, in which Ω-profiles grow while maintaining a narrow pore, slows down release. Shrink and enlarge fusion may thus account for diverse hormone and transmitter release kinetics observed in secretory cells, previously interpreted within the full-collapse/kiss-and-run framework."	0

Furthermore, we show that these spared RGCs are electrophysiologically functional and thus still have potential value for the function and regeneration of the retina. Finally, we demonstrate that the death of RGCs depends on a combination of both an injury to the neurons and the presence of reactive astrocytes, suggesting a model that may explain why reactive astrocytes are toxic only in some circumstances. Altogether, these findings highlight reactive astrocytes as drivers of RGC death in a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the eye."	0

"30598363"	"RIPK1 and Caspase-8 Ensure Chromosome Stability Independently of Their Role in Cell Death and Inflammation.Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 functions as a key mediator of tissue homeostasis via formation of Caspase-8 activating ripoptosome complexes, positively and negatively regulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation. Here, we report an unanticipated cell-death- and inflammation-independent function of RIPK1 and Caspase-8, promoting faithful chromosome alignment in mitosis and thereby ensuring genome stability. We find that ripoptosome complexes progressively form as cells enter mitosis, peaking at metaphase and disassembling as cells exit mitosis. Genetic deletion and mitosis-specific inhibition of Ripk1 or Caspase-8 results in chromosome alignment defects independently of MLKL. We found that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited into mitotic ripoptosomes, where PLK1's activity is controlled via RIPK1-dependent recruitment and Caspase-8-mediated cleavage. A fine balance of ripoptosome assembly is required as deregulated ripoptosome activity modulates PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as BUBR1. Our data suggest that ripoptosome-mediated regulation of PLK1 contributes to faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis."	1

"32521279"	"Rrp6 Moonlights in an RNA Exosome-Independent Manner to Promote Cell Survival and Gene Expression during Stress.The nuclear RNA exosome is essential for RNA processing and degradation. Here, we show that the exosome nuclear-specific subunit Rrp6p promotes cell survival during heat stress through the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, independently of its catalytic activity or association with the core exosome. Rrp6p exhibits negative genetic interactions with the Slt2/Mpk1p or Paf1p elongation factors required for expression of CWI genes during stress. Overexpression of Rrp6p or of its catalytically inactive or exosome-independent mutants can partially rescue the growth defect of the mpk1Δ mutant and stimulates expression of the Mpk1p target gene FKS2. The rrp6Δ and mpk1Δ mutants show similarities in deficient expression of CWI genes during heat shock, and overexpression of the CWI gene HSP150 can rescue the stress-induced lethality of the mpk1Δrp6Δ mutant. These results demonstrate that Rrp6p moonlights independently from the exosome to ensure proper expression of CWI genes and to promote cell survival during stress."	0

The role of BRD4 in cancer has been attributed mainly to the abundant long isoform (BRD4-L). Here we show, by isoform-specific knockdown and endogenous protein detection, along with transgene expression, the less abundant BRD4 short isoform (BRD4-S) is oncogenic while BRD4-L is tumor-suppressive in breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, as well as mammary tumor formation and metastasis. Through integrated RNA-seq, genome-wide ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN association profiling, we identify the Engrailed-1 (EN1) homeobox transcription factor as a key BRD4-S coregulator, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer. BRD4-S and EN1 comodulate the extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated matrisome network, including type II cystatin gene cluster, mucin 5, and cathepsin loci, via enhancer regulation of cancer-associated genes and pathways. Our work highlights the importance of targeted therapies for the oncogenic, but not tumor-suppressive, activity of BRD4."	0
"30922844"	"A Role for Chromatin Remodeling in Cohesin Loading onto Chromosomes.Cohesin is a conserved, ring-shaped protein complex that topologically embraces DNA. Its central role in genome organization includes functions in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Cohesin loading onto chromosomes requires the Scc2-Scc4 cohesin loader, whose presence on chromatin in budding yeast depends on the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. Here we reveal a dual role of RSC in cohesin loading. RSC acts as a chromatin receptor that recruits Scc2-Scc4 by a direct protein interaction independent of chromatin remodeling. In addition, chromatin remodeling is required to generate a nucleosome-free region that is the substrate for cohesin loading. An engineered cohesin loading module can be created by fusing the Scc2 C terminus to RSC or to other chromatin remodelers, but not to unrelated DNA binding proteins. These observations demonstrate the importance of nucleosome-free DNA for cohesin loading and provide insight into how cohesin accesses DNA during its varied chromosomal activities."	0

The contribution of astrocytic lactate to neuronal bioenergetics and the mechanisms of astrocytic lactate production are incompletely understood. Through in vivo<sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, <sup>13</sup>C glucose mass spectroscopy, and electroencephalographic and molecular studies, here we show that the energy sensor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates neuronal survival in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Ampk-null mice are deficient in brain lactate and are seizure prone. Ampk deletion in astroglia, but not neurons, causes neuronal loss in both mammalian and fly brains. Mechanistically, astrocytic AMPK phosphorylated and destabilized thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), enabling expression and surface translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT1, glucose uptake, and lactate production. Ampk loss in astrocytes causes TXNIP hyperstability, GLUT1 misregulation, inadequate glucose metabolism, and neuronal loss."	0
"32868902"	"Lipid peroxidation regulates long-range wound detection through 5-lipoxygenase in zebrafish.Rapid wound detection by distant leukocytes is essential for antimicrobial defence and post-infection survival<sup>1</sup>. The reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide and the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid are among the earliest known mediators of this process<sup>2-4</sup>. It is unknown whether or how these highly conserved cues collaborate to achieve wound detection over distances of several hundreds of micrometres within a few minutes. To investigate this, we locally applied arachidonic acid and skin-permeable peroxide by micropipette perfusion to unwounded zebrafish tail fins. As in wounds, arachidonic acid rapidly attracted leukocytes through dual oxidase (Duox) and 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5a). Peroxide promoted chemotaxis to arachidonic acid without being chemotactic on its own. Intravital biosensor imaging showed that wound peroxide and arachidonic acid converged on half-millimetre-long lipid peroxidation gradients that promoted leukocyte attraction. Our data suggest that lipid peroxidation functions as a spatial redox relay that enables long-range detection of early wound cues by immune cells, outlining a beneficial role for this otherwise toxic process."	0
"31076285"	"The RNA-Binding ATPase, Armitage, Couples piRNA Amplification in Nuage to Phased piRNA Production on Mitochondria.PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons in Drosophila ovaries, ensuring female fertility. Two coupled pathways generate germline piRNAs: the ping-pong cycle, in which the PIWI proteins Aubergine and Ago3 increase the abundance of pre-existing piRNAs, and the phased piRNA pathway, which generates strings of tail-to-head piRNAs, one after another. Proteins acting in the ping-pong cycle localize to nuage, whereas phased piRNA production requires Zucchini, an endonuclease on the mitochondrial surface. Here, we report that Armitage (Armi), an RNA-binding ATPase localized to both nuage and mitochondria, links the ping-pong cycle to the phased piRNA pathway. Mutations that block phased piRNA production deplete Armi from nuage. Armi ATPase mutants cannot support phased piRNA production and inappropriately bind mRNA instead of piRNA precursors. We propose that Armi shuttles between nuage and mitochondria, feeding precursor piRNAs generated by Ago3 cleavage into the Zucchini-dependent production of Aubergine- and Piwi-bound piRNAs on the mitochondrial surface."	0

In-depth understanding of the SFTSV-induced pathogenesis mechanism is critical for developing effective anti-SFTS therapeutics. Here, we report transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from SFTS patients. We observe a strong correlation between inflammatory responses and disease progression and fatal outcome. Quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV infection confirms the induction of inflammation and further reveals virus-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, SFTSV infection triggers BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK) upregulation and BAK/BCL2-associated X (BAX) activation, leading to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidization and subsequent cytosolic release. The cytosolic mtDNA binds and triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, the BAK expression level correlates with SFTS disease progression and fatal outcome. These findings provide insights into the clinical features and molecular underpinnings of severe SFTS, which may aid in patient care and therapeutic design, and may also be conserved during infection by other highly pathogenic viruses."	0

We establish 2,135 hESC lines, representing three clones each of 714 doxycycline (Dox)-inducible genes including 481 TFs, and obtain 26,998 microscopic cell images and 2,174 transcriptome datasets-RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarrays-48 h after the presence or absence of Dox. Interestingly, the expression of essentially all the genes, including genes located in heterochromatin regions, are perturbed by these TFs.

"32464092"	"Sequence-Independent Self-Assembly of Germ Granule mRNAs into Homotypic Clusters.mRNAs enriched in membraneless condensates provide functional compartmentalization within cells. The mechanisms that recruit transcripts to condensates are under intense study; however, how mRNAs organize once they reach a granule remains poorly understood. Here, we report on a self-sorting mechanism by which multiple mRNAs derived from the same gene assemble into discrete homotypic clusters. We demonstrate that in vivo mRNA localization to granules and self-assembly within granules are governed by different mRNA features: localization is encoded by specific RNA regions, whereas self-assembly involves the entire mRNA, does not involve sequence-specific, ordered intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions, and is thus RNA sequence independent. We propose that the ability of mRNAs to self-sort into homotypic assemblies is an inherent property of an messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) that is augmented under conditions that increase RNA concentration, such as upon enrichment in RNA-protein granules, a process that appears conserved in diverse cellular contexts and organisms."	0
"32032532"	"Regulation of Cohesin-Mediated Chromosome Folding by Eco1 and Other Partners.Cohesin, a member of the SMC complex family, holds sister chromatids together but also shapes chromosomes by promoting the formation of long-range intra-chromatid loops, a process proposed to be mediated by DNA loop extrusion. Here we describe the roles of three cohesin partners, Pds5, Wpl1, and Eco1, in loop formation along either unreplicated or mitotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. Pds5 limits the size of DNA loops via two different pathways: the canonical Wpl1-mediated releasing activity and an Eco1-dependent mechanism. In the absence of Pds5, the main barrier to DNA loop expansion appears to be the centromere. Our data also show that Eco1 acetyl-transferase inhibits the translocase activity that powers loop formation and contributes to the positioning of loops through a mechanism that is distinguishable from its role in cohesion establishment. This study reveals that the mechanisms regulating cohesin-dependent chromatin loops are conserved among eukaryotes while promoting different functions."	0

We have determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of complete Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA transcription elongation complexes, comprising RNA polymerase; DNA; RNA bearing an N-utilization-site-like anti-termination element; Nus factors A, B, E, and G; inositol mono-phosphatase SuhB; and ribosomal protein S4. Our structures and structure-informed functional analyses show that fast transcription and anti-termination involve suppression of NusA-stabilized pausing, enhancement of NusG-mediated anti-backtracking, sequestration of the NusG C-terminal domain from termination factor ρ, and the ρ blockade. Strikingly, the factors form a composite RNA chaperone around the RNA polymerase RNA-exit tunnel, which supports co-transcriptional RNA folding and annealing of distal RNA regions. Our work reveals a polymerase/chaperone machine required for biosynthesis of functional ribosomes."	0
"32513871"	"CRISPR type II-A subgroups exhibit phylogenetically distinct mechanisms for prespacer insertion.CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes against foreign nucleic acids. Prokaryotes gain immunity by acquiring short pieces of the invading nucleic acid termed prespacers and inserting them into their CRISPR array. In type II-A systems, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins insert prespacers always at the leader-repeat junction of the CRISPR array. Among type II-A CRISPR systems, three distinct groups (G1, G2, and G3) exist according to the extent of DNA sequence conservation at the 3' end of the leader. However, the mechanisms by which these conserved motifs interact with their cognate Cas1 and Cas2 proteins remain unclear. Here, we performed <i>in vitro</i> integration assays, finding that for G1 and G2, the insertion site is recognized through defined mechanisms, at least in members examined to date, whereas G3 exhibits no sequence-specific insertion. G1 first recognized a 12-bp sequence at the leader-repeat junction and performed leader-side insertion before proceeding to spacer-side insertion. G2 recognized the full repeat sequence and could perform independent leader-side or spacer-side insertions, although the leader-side insertion was faster than spacer-side. The prespacer morphology requirements for Cas1-Cas2 varied, with G1 stringently requiring a 5-nucleotide 3' overhang and G2 being able to insert many forms of prespacers with variable efficiencies. These results highlight the intricacy of protein-DNA sequence interactions within the seemingly similar type II-A integration complexes and provide mechanistic insights into prespacer insertion. These interactions can be fine-tuned to expand the Cas1-Cas2 toolset for inserting small DNAs into diverse DNA targets."	0
"32697996"	"The lncRNA Growth Arrest Specific 5 Regulates Cell Survival via Distinct Structural Modules with Independent Functions.There is increasing evidence that the architecture of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)-just like that of proteins-is hierarchically organized into independently folding sub-modules with distinct functions. Studies characterizing the cellular activities of such modules, however, are rare. The lncRNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) is a key regulator of cell survival in response to stress and nutrient availability. We use SHAPE-MaP to probe the structure of GAS5 and identify three separate structural modules that act independently in leukemic T cells. The 5' terminal module with low secondary structure content affects basal survival and slows the cell cycle, whereas the highly structured core module mediates the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition on cell growth. These results highlight the central role of GAS5 in regulating cell survival and reveal how a single lncRNA transcript utilizes a modular structure-function relationship to respond to a variety of cellular stresses under various cellular conditions."	0

Administration of fluorescently labeled HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers displayed on liposomes enables visualization of targeted cells and tissues. Both s.c. and i.m. routes induce efficient immune cell infiltration, activation, and antigen uptake, functions that are tightly restricted to the skin and muscle, respectively. Antigen is also transported to different lymph nodes depending on route. However, these early differences do not translate into significant differences in the magnitude or quality of antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses over time. Thus, although some distinct immunological differences are noted, the choice of route may instead be motivated by clinical practicality."	0
"32783944"	"Single-Cell Profiling Shows Murine Forebrain Neural Stem Cells Reacquire a Developmental State when Activated for Adult Neurogenesis.The transitions from developing to adult quiescent and activated neural stem cells (NSCs) are not well understood. Here, we use single-cell transcriptional profiling and lineage tracing to characterize these transitions in the murine forebrain. We show that the two forebrain NSC parental populations, embryonic cortex and ganglionic eminence radial precursors (RPs), are highly similar even though they make glutamatergic versus gabaergic neurons. Both RP populations progress linearly to transition from a highly active embryonic to a dormant adult stem cell state that still shares many similarities with embryonic RPs. When adult NSCs of either embryonic origin become reactivated to make gabaergic neurons, they acquire a developing ganglionic eminence RP-like identity. Thus, transitions from embryonic RPs to adult NSCs and back to neuronal progenitors do not involve fundamental changes in cell identity, but rather reflect conversions between activated and dormant NSC states that may be determined by the niche environment."	0

The first step combines enhancement of ACTIVIN/NODAL and WNT and inhibition of BMP pathways. By day 5 of differentiation, hPSC-derived cells express notochordal cell characteristic genes. After activating the TGF-β pathway for an additional 15 days, qPCR, immunostaining, and transcriptome data show that a wide array of NP markers are expressed. Transcriptomically, the in vitro-derived cells become more like in vivo adolescent human NP cells, driven by a set of influential genes enriched with motifs bound by BRACHYURY and FOXA2, consistent with an NP cell-like identity.

"31442424"	"Non-canonical mTORC2 Signaling Regulates Brown Adipocyte Lipid Catabolism through SIRT6-FoxO1.mTORC2 controls glucose and lipid metabolism, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that conditionally deleting the essential mTORC2 subunit Rictor in murine brown adipocytes inhibits de novo lipid synthesis, promotes lipid catabolism and thermogenesis, and protects against diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. AKT kinases are the canonical mTORC2 substrates; however, deleting Rictor in brown adipocytes appears to drive lipid catabolism by promoting FoxO1 deacetylation independently of AKT, and in a pathway distinct from its positive role in anabolic lipid synthesis. This facilitates FoxO1 nuclear retention, enhances lipid uptake and lipolysis, and potentiates UCP1 expression. We provide evidence that SIRT6 is the FoxO1 deacetylase suppressed by mTORC2 and show an endogenous interaction between SIRT6 and mTORC2 in both mouse and human cells. Our findings suggest a new paradigm of mTORC2 function filling an important gap in our understanding of this more mysterious mTOR complex."	0
"32023452"	"Bookmarking by Non-pioneer Transcription Factors during Liver Development Establishes Competence for Future Gene Activation.Transcription factor binding to enhancer and promoter regions critical for homeostatic adult gene activation is established during development. To understand how cell-specific gene expression patterns are generated, we study the developmental timing of association of two prominent hepatic transcription factors with gene regulatory regions. Most individual binding events display extraordinarily high temporal variations during liver development. Early and persistent binding is necessary, but not sufficient, for gene activation. Stable gene expression patterns are the result of combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors, which mark regulatory regions long before activation and promote progressive broadening of active chromatin domains. Both temporally stable and dynamic, short-lived binding events contribute to the developmental maturation of active promoter configurations. The results reveal a developmental bookmarking function of master regulators and illuminate remarkable parallels between the principles employed for gene activation during development, during evolution, and upon mitotic exit."	0

Despite the pleiotropic functions of St18, little is known about its roles in macrophages. Here, we report that myeloid St18 is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A. Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation. Mechanistically, St18 directly binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A. Using mouse genetic and pharmacological models, we reveal myeloid St18 as a critical septic death protector."	1
"32313104"	"Overcoming Wnt-β-catenin dependent anticancer therapy resistance in leukaemia stem cells.Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) underlie cancer therapy resistance but targeting these cells remains difficult. The Wnt-β-catenin and PI3K-Akt pathways cooperate to promote tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. In a mouse model in which both pathways are activated in stem and progenitor cells, LSCs expanded under chemotherapy-induced stress. Since Akt can activate β-catenin, inhibiting this interaction might target therapy-resistant LSCs. High-throughput screening identified doxorubicin (DXR) as an inhibitor of the Akt-β-catenin interaction at low doses. Here we repurposed DXR as a targeted inhibitor rather than a broadly cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted DXR reduced Akt-activated β-catenin levels in chemoresistant LSCs and reduced LSC tumorigenic activity. Mechanistically, β-catenin binds multiple immune-checkpoint gene loci, and targeted DXR treatment inhibited expression of multiple immune checkpoints specifically in LSCs, including PD-L1, TIM3 and CD24. Overall, LSCs exhibit distinct properties of immune resistance that are reduced by inhibiting Akt-activated β-catenin. These findings suggest a strategy for overcoming cancer therapy resistance and immune escape."	0

We used HiCorr to compare the high-resolution maps of chromatin interactions from 10 tissue or cell types with a focus on neurogenesis and brain tissues. We found that dynamic chromatin loops are better hallmarks for cellular differentiation than compartment switching. HiCorr allowed direct observation of cell-type- and differentiation-specific E-P aggregates spanning large neighborhoods, suggesting a mechanism that stabilizes enhancer contacts during development.

Heterochromatin constituents correlated with the lowest mobility chromatin, whereas transcription factors varied widely with regard to their respective mobility with low- or high-mobility chromatin. Pioneer transcription factors, which bind nucleosomes, can access the low-mobility chromatin domains, whereas weak or non-nucleosome binding factors are excluded from the domains and enriched in higher mobility domains. Nonspecific DNA and nucleosome binding accounted for most of the low mobility of strong nucleosome interactor FOXA1. Our analysis shows how the parameters of the mobility of chromatin-bound factors, but not their diffusion behaviors or SMT-residence times within chromatin, distinguish functional characteristics of different chromatin-interacting proteins."	0
"32160538"	"Genomic Repeats Categorize Genes with Distinct Functions for Orchestrated Regulation.Repetitive elements are abundantly distributed in mammalian genomes. Here, we reveal a striking association between repeat subtypes and gene function. SINE, L1, and low-complexity repeats demarcate distinct functional categories of genes and may dictate the time and level of gene expression by providing binding sites for different regulatory proteins. Importantly, imaging and sequencing analysis show that L1 repeats sequester a large set of genes with specialized functions in nucleolus- and lamina-associated inactive domains that are depleted of SINE repeats. In addition, L1 transcripts bind extensively to its DNA in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Depletion of L1 RNA in ESCs leads to relocation of L1-enriched chromosomal segments from inactive domains to the nuclear interior and de-repression of L1-associated genes. These results demonstrate a role of L1 DNA and RNA in gene silencing and suggest a general theme of genomic repeats in orchestrating the function, regulation, and expression of their host genes."	0

"32330457"	"Threonine ADP-Ribosylation of Ubiquitin by a Bacterial Effector Family Blocks Host Ubiquitination.Ubiquitination is essential for numerous eukaryotic cellular processes. Here, we show that the type III effector CteC from Chromobacterium violaceum functions as an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase that specifically modifies ubiquitin via threonine ADP-ribosylation on residue T66. The covalent modification prevents the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, which inhibits subsequent ubiquitin activation by E2 and E3 enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade and leads to the shutdown of polyubiquitin synthesis in host cells. This unique modification also causes dysfunction of polyubiquitin chains in cells, thereby blocking host ubiquitin signaling. The disruption of host ubiquitination by CteC plays a crucial role in C. violaceum colonization in mice during infection. CteC represents a family of effector proteins in pathogens of hosts from different kingdoms. All the members of this family specifically ADP-ribosylate ubiquitin. The action of CteC reveals a new mechanism for interfering with host ubiquitination by pathogens."	0

To better understand this process, we investigated native assembly intermediates of the mitoribosomal large subunit from the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei using cryo-electron microscopy. We identify 28 assembly factors, 6 of which are homologous to bacterial and eukaryotic ribosome assembly factors. They interact with the partially folded rRNA by specifically recognizing functionally important regions such as the peptidyltransferase center. The architectural and compositional comparison of the assembly intermediates indicates a stepwise modular assembly process, during which the rRNA folds toward its mature state. During the process, several conserved GTPases and a helicase form highly intertwined interaction networks that stabilize distinct assembly intermediates.

The binding of YAP1/TEAD4 to ERα-bound enhancers is augmented upon E<sub>2</sub> stimulation and is required for the induction of E<sub>2</sub>/ERα target genes and E<sub>2</sub>-induced oncogenic cell growth. Furthermore, their enhancer binding is a prerequisite for enhancer activation marked by eRNA transcription and for the recruitment of the enhancer activation machinery component MED1. The binding of TEAD4 on active ERE-containing enhancers is independent of its DNA-binding behavior, and instead, occurs through protein-tethering trans-binding. Our data reveal a non-canonical function of YAP1 and TEAD4 as ERα cofactors in regulating cancer growth, highlighting the potential of YAP/TEAD as possible actionable drug targets for ERα<sup>+</sup> breast cancer."	0
"32049012"	"HILPDA Uncouples Lipid Droplet Accumulation in Adipose Tissue Macrophages from Inflammation and Metabolic Dysregulation.Obesity leads to a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation that features the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in adipose tissue. Here, we determined the role of macrophage lipid-droplet accumulation in the development of obesity-induced adipose-tissue inflammation, using mice with myeloid-specific deficiency of the lipid-inducible HILPDA protein. HILPDA deficiency markedly reduced intracellular lipid levels and accumulation of fluorescently labeled fatty acids. Decreased lipid storage in HILPDA-deficient macrophages can be rescued by inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and is associated with increased oxidative metabolism. In diet-induced obese mice, HILPDA deficiency does not alter inflammatory and metabolic parameters, despite markedly reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages. Overall, we find that HILPDA is a lipid-inducible, physiological inhibitor of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in macrophages and uncouples lipid storage in adipose tissue macrophages from inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Our data question the contribution of lipid droplet accumulation in adipose tissue macrophages in obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic dysregulation."	0
"32402283"	"A Biomarker for Predicting Responsiveness to Stem Cell Therapy Based on Mechanism-of-Action: Evidence from Cerebral Injury.To date, no stem cell therapy has been directed to specific recipients-and, conversely, withheld from others-based on a clinical or molecular profile congruent with that cell's therapeutic mechanism-of-action (MOA) for that condition. We address this challenge preclinically with a prototypical scenario: human neural stem cells (hNSCs) against perinatal/neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII). We demonstrate that a clinically translatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) algorithm, hierarchical region splitting, provides a rigorous, expeditious, prospective, noninvasive ""biomarker"" for identifying subjects with lesions bearing a molecular profile indicative of responsiveness to hNSCs' neuroprotective MOA. Implanted hNSCs improve lesional, motor, and/or cognitive outcomes only when there is an MRI-measurable penumbra that can be forestalled from evolving into necrotic core; the core never improves. Unlike the core, a penumbra is characterized by a molecular profile associated with salvageability. Hence, only lesions characterized by penumbral > core volumes should be treated with cells, making such measurements arguably a regenerative medicine selection biomarker."	0

Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological advancements. Here we modified yeast translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adapted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ss) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ss), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ss distribute similarly across 5'TRs, indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed yeast and human selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq), enabling selection of 40Ss and 80Ss associated with immuno-targeted factors. Sel-TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5' UTRs with scanning 40Ss to successively dissociate upon AUG recognition; notably, a proportion of eIF3 lingers on during the initial elongation cycles. Highlighting Sel-TCP-seq versatility, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes."	0
"32692974"	"Translational Repression of G3BP in Cancer and Germ Cells Suppresses Stress Granules and Enhances Stress Tolerance.Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less ribonucleoprotein condensates that form in response to various stress stimuli via phase separation. SGs act as a protective mechanism to cope with acute stress, but persistent SGs have cytotoxic effects that are associated with several age-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the testis-specific protein, MAGE-B2, increases cellular stress tolerance by suppressing SG formation through translational inhibition of the key SG nucleator G3BP. MAGE-B2 reduces G3BP protein levels below the critical concentration for phase separation and suppresses SG initiation. Knockout of the MAGE-B2 mouse ortholog or overexpression of G3BP1 confers hypersensitivity of the male germline to heat stress in vivo. Thus, MAGE-B2 provides cytoprotection to maintain mammalian spermatogenesis, a highly thermosensitive process that must be preserved throughout reproductive life. These results demonstrate a mechanism that allows for tissue-specific resistance against stress and could aid in the development of male fertility therapies."	1
"31968264"	"Transcriptional Programming of Human Mechanosensory Neuron Subtypes from Pluripotent Stem Cells.Efficient and homogeneous in vitro generation of peripheral sensory neurons may provide a framework for novel drug screening platforms and disease models of touch and pain. We discover that, by overexpressing NGN2 and BRN3A, human pluripotent stem cells can be transcriptionally programmed to differentiate into a surprisingly uniform culture of cold- and mechano-sensing neurons. Although such a neuronal subtype is not found in mice, we identify molecular evidence for its existence in human sensory ganglia. Combining NGN2 and BRN3A programming with neural crest patterning, we produce two additional populations of sensory neurons, including a specialized touch receptor neuron subtype. Finally, we apply this system to model a rare inherited sensory disorder of touch and proprioception caused by inactivating mutations in PIEZO2. Together, these findings establish an approach to specify distinct sensory neuron subtypes in vitro, underscoring the utility of stem cell technology to capture human-specific features of physiology and disease."	0
"31051141"	"Reversible Disruption of Specific Transcription Factor-DNA Interactions Using CRISPR/Cas9.The control of gene expression by transcription factor binding sites frequently determines phenotype. However, it is difficult to determine the function of single transcription factor binding sites within larger transcription networks. Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to disrupt binding to specific sites, a method we term CRISPRd. Since CRISPR guide RNAs are longer than transcription factor binding sites, flanking sequence can be used to target specific sites. Targeting dCas9 to an Oct4 site in the Nanog promoter displaced Oct4 from this site, reduced Nanog expression, and slowed division. In contrast, disrupting the Oct4 binding site adjacent to Pax6 upregulated Pax6 transcription and disrupting Nanog binding its own promoter upregulated its transcription. Thus, we can easily distinguish between activating and repressing binding sites and examine autoregulation. Finally, multiple guide RNA expression allows simultaneous inhibition of multiple binding sites, and conditionally destabilized dCas9 allows rapid reversibility."	0

We induce CBA-specific, IL-35-producing T regulatory (Treg) cells in Treg<sup>Ebi3WT</sup> C57BL/6 reporter mice and identify IL-35 producers by expression of Ebi3<sup>TdTom</sup> gene reporter plus Ebi3 and p35 proteins. Curiously, both subunits of IL-35 are displayed on the surface of tolerogen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>neg</sup> (iTr35) T cells. Furthermore, IL-35 producers, although rare, secrete Ebi3 and p35 on extracellular vesicles (EVs) targeting a 25- to 100-fold higher number of T and B lymphocytes, causing them to acquire surface IL-35. This surface IL-35 is absent when EV production is inhibited or if Ebi3 is genetically deleted in Treg cells. The unique ability of EVs to coat bystander lymphocytes with IL-35, promoting exhaustion in, and secondary suppression by, non-Treg cells identifies a novel mechanism of infectious tolerance."	0

The mechanisms by which pTFs overcome the chromatin barrier are not well understood. Here, we reveal, using single-molecule fluorescence, how the yeast transcription factor Rap1 invades and remodels chromatin. Using a reconstituted chromatin system replicating yeast promoter architecture, we demonstrate that Rap1 can bind nucleosomal DNA within a chromatin fiber but with shortened dwell times compared to naked DNA. Moreover, we show that Rap1 binding opens chromatin fiber structure by inhibiting inter-nucleosome contacts. Finally, we reveal that Rap1 collaborates with the chromatin remodeler RSC to displace promoter nucleosomes, paving the way for long-lived bound states on newly exposed DNA. Together, our results provide a mechanistic view of how Rap1 gains access and opens chromatin, thereby establishing an active promoter architecture and controlling gene expression."	0

Full engagement of effector T cells occurs only when signaling exceeds a critical threshold that enables induction of immune response genes carrying an epigenetic memory of prior activation. Here we investigate the underlying mechanisms causing the suppression of normal immune responses when T cells are rendered anergic by tolerance induction. By performing an integrated analysis of signaling, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression, we demonstrate that immunological tolerance is established when both signaling to and chromatin priming of immune response genes are weakened. In parallel, chromatin priming of immune-repressive genes becomes boosted, rendering them sensitive to low levels of signaling below the threshold needed to activate immune response genes. Our study reveals how repeated exposure to antigens causes an altered epigenetic state leading to T cell anergy and tolerance, representing a basis for treating auto-immune diseases."	0

The mechanistic basis for activation of this ribotoxic stress response (RSR) remains completely obscure. We show that the long isoform of ZAK (ZAKα) directly associates with ribosomes by inserting its flexible C terminus into the ribosomal intersubunit space. Here, ZAKα binds helix 14 of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). An adjacent domain in ZAKα also probes the ribosome, and together, these sensor domains are critically required for RSR activation after inhibition of both the E-site, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), and ribotoxin action. Finally, we show that ablation of the RSR response leads to organismal phenotypes and decreased lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Our findings yield mechanistic insight into how cells detect ribotoxic stress and provide experimental in vivo evidence for its physiological importance."	0

"32268099"	"PGC1α Controls Sucrose Taste Sensitization in Drosophila.Perceived palatability of food controls caloric intake. Sweet taste is the primary means of detecting the carbohydrate content of food. Surprisingly, sweet taste sensitivity is responsive to extrinsic factors like diet, and this occurs by unknown mechanisms. Here, we describe an unbiased proteomic investigation into sweet taste sensitivity in the fruit fly. We identify a dopamine/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/CREB axis acting within sweet taste neurons that controls taste perception but is largely dispensable for acute taste transduction. This pathway modulates sweet taste perception in response to both sensory- and nutrient-restricted diets and converges on PGC1α, a critical regulator of metabolic health and lifespan. By electrophysiology, we found that enhanced sucrose taste sensitivity was the result of heightened sweet taste intensity and that PGC1α was both necessary and sufficient for this effect. Together, we provide the first molecular insight into how diet-induced taste perception is regulated within the sweet taste neuron."	0

"32516598"	"Endogenous DNA 3' Blocks Are Vulnerabilities for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Deficiency and Are Reversed by the APE2 Nuclease.The APEX2 gene encodes APE2, a nuclease related to APE1, the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease acting in base excision repair. Loss of APE2 is lethal in cells with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, making APE2 a prime target for homologous recombination-defective cancers. However, because the function of APE2 in DNA repair is poorly understood, it is unclear why BRCA-deficient cells require APE2 for viability. Here we present the genetic interaction profiles of APE2, APE1, and TDP1 deficiency coupled to biochemical and structural dissection of APE2. We conclude that the main role of APE2 is to reverse blocked 3' DNA ends, problematic lesions that preclude DNA synthesis. Our work also suggests that TOP1 processing of genomic ribonucleotides is the main source of 3'-blocking lesions relevant to APEX2-BRCA1/2 synthetic lethality. The exquisite sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to 3' blocks indicates that they represent a tractable vulnerability in homologous recombination-deficient tumor cells."	0
"32846129"	"Mechanical Ring Interfaces between Adherens Junction and Contractile Actomyosin to Coordinate Entotic Cell-in-Cell Formation.Entosis is a cell-in-cell (CIC)-mediated death program. Contractile actomyosin (CA) and the adherens junction (AJ) are two core elements essential for entotic CIC formation, but the molecular structures interfacing them remain poorly understood. Here, we report the characterization of a ring-like structure interfacing between the peripheries of invading and engulfing cells. The ring-like structure is a multi-molecular complex consisting of adhesive and cytoskeletal proteins, in which the mechanical sensor vinculin is highly enriched. The vinculin-enriched structure senses mechanical force imposed on cells, as indicated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, and is thus termed the mechanical ring (MR). The MR actively interacts with CA and the AJ to help establish and maintain polarized actomyosin that drives cell internalization. Vinculin depletion leads to compromised MR formation, CA depolarization, and subsequent CIC failure. In summary, we suggest that the vinculin-enriched MR, in addition to CA and AJ, is another core element essential for entosis."	0

Inosine recognition is conserved, but changes in several connecting loops in eukaryotic EndoV confer recognition of 3 ribonucleotides upstream and 7 or 8 bp of dsRNA downstream of the cleavage site, and bacterial EndoV binds only 2 or 3 nt flanking the scissile phosphate.

Here we mapped GR's chromatin occupancy in mouse livers throughout the day and night cycle. We show how GR partitions metabolic processes by time-dependent target gene regulation and controls circulating glucose and triglycerides differentially during feeding and fasting. Highlighting the dominant role GR plays in synchronizing circadian amplitudes, we find that the majority of oscillating genes are bound by and depend on GR. This rhythmic pattern is altered by high-fat diet in a ligand-independent manner. We find that the remodeling of oscillatory gene expression and postprandial GR binding results from a concomitant increase of STAT5 co-occupancy in obese mice. Altogether, our findings highlight GR's fundamental role in the rhythmic orchestration of hepatic metabolism."	0
"32579926"	"Recently Evolved Enhancers Emerge with High Interindividual Variability and Less Frequently Associate with Disease.Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA such as enhancers underlie a wide variety of diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. As enhancers rapidly evolve, understanding their function and configuration in non-human disease models can have important clinical applications. Here, we analyze enhancer configurations in tissues isolated from the common marmoset, a widely used primate model for human disease. Integrating these data with human and mouse data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive B-compartments. Our data show that enhancers typically emerge as instable elements with minimal biological impact prior to their integration in a transcriptional program. Furthermore, our data provide insight into which trait variations in enhancers can be faithfully modeled using the common marmoset."	0

Mutational analysis, photoaffinity labeling, and structural studies have provided evidence for intersubunit and intrasubunit steroid-binding sites in the GABA<sub>A</sub>R transmembrane domain, but revealed only little definition of their binding properties. Here, we identified steroid-binding sites in purified human α1β3 and α1β3γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs by photoaffinity labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]21-[4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirine-3-yl)benzoxy]allopregnanolone ([<sup>3</sup>H]21-<i>p</i>TFDBzox-AP), a potent GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAM. Protein microsequencing established 3α5α-P inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids near the cytoplasmic end of the β subunit M4 (β3Pro-415, β3Leu-417, and β3Thr-418) and M3 (β3Arg-309) helices located at the base of a pocket in the β<sup>+</sup>-α<sup>-</sup> subunit interface that extends to the level of αGln-242, a steroid sensitivity determinant in the αM1 helix. Competition photolabeling established that this site binds with high affinity a structurally diverse group of 3α-OH steroids that act as anesthetics, anti-epileptics, and anti-depressants. The presence of a 3α-OH was crucial: 3-acetylated, 3-deoxy, and 3-oxo analogs of 3α5α-P, as well as 3β-OH analogs that are GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonists, bound with at least 1000-fold lower affinity than 3α5α-P. Similarly, for GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAMs with the C-20 carbonyl of 3α5α-P or pregnanolone reduced to a hydroxyl, binding affinity is reduced by 1,000-fold, whereas binding is retained after deoxygenation at the C-20 position. These results provide a first insight into the structure-activity relationship at the GABA<sub>A</sub>R β<sup>+</sup>-α<sup>-</sup> subunit interface steroid-binding site and identify several steroid PAMs that act via other sites."	0

We systematically evaluate several methods to identify tumor purity of organoids established from intrapulmonary tumors. Eighty percent of organoids from intrapulmonary lesions have a normal copy number profile, suggesting overgrowth by normal airway organoids (AOs). This is further supported by the failure to detect mutations found in the original tumor in organoids. Histomorphology alone is insufficient to determine tumor purity, but when combined with p63 immunostaining, tumor and normal AOs can be distinguished. Taking into account overgrowth by normal AOs, the establishment rate of pure NSCLC organoids is 17%.

Here, we examined this binding activity using fluorescence anisotropy with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled ICE-like oligomer (FAM-ICE). In the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Irr addition increased the fluorescence anisotropy, corresponding to formation of the Irr-ICE complex. The addition of EDTA to the Irr-ICE complex reduced fluorescence anisotropy, but fluorescence was recovered after Mn<sup>2+</sup> addition, indicating that Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding is a prerequisite for complex formation. Binding activity toward ICE was lost upon introduction of substitutions in a His-cluster region of Irr, revealing that Mn<sup>2+</sup> binds to this region. We observed that the His-cluster region is also the heme binding site; results from fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses disclosed that the addition of a half-equivalent of heme dissociates Irr from ICE, likely because of Mn<sup>2+</sup> release due to heme binding. We hypothesized that heme binding to another heme binding site, Cys-29, would also inhibit the formation of the Irr-ICE complex because it is proximal to the ICE binding site, which was supported by the loss of ICE binding activity in a Cys-29-mutated Irr. These results indicate that Irr requires Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding to form the Irr-ICE complex and that the addition of heme dissociates Irr from ICE by replacing Mn<sup>2+</sup> with heme or by heme binding to Cys-29."	0

Here we describe a genome-wide screen for NMD factors that uncovers an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3' untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen reveals that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which, in turn, is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3' UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3' UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Because of the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3' UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress."	0

Because of their dual protease and ligase activity, plant legumains have become of particular biotechnological interest, <i>e.g.</i> for the synthesis of cyclic peptides for drug design or for protein engineering. However, the molecular mechanisms behind their dual protease and ligase activities are still poorly understood, limiting their applications. Here, we present the crystal structure of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> legumain isoform β (AtLEGβ) in its zymogen state. Combining structural and biochemical experiments, we show for the first time that plant legumains encode distinct, isoform-specific activation mechanisms. Whereas the autocatalytic activation of isoform γ (AtLEGγ) is controlled by the latency-conferring dimer state, the activation of the monomeric AtLEGβ is concentration independent. Additionally, in AtLEGβ the plant-characteristic two-chain intermediate state is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions, as in AtLEGγ, resulting in significantly different pH stability profiles. The crystal structure of AtLEGβ revealed unrestricted nonprime substrate binding pockets, consistent with the broad substrate specificity, as determined by degradomic assays. Further to its protease activity, we show that AtLEGβ exhibits a true peptide ligase activity. Whereas cleavage-dependent transpeptidase activity has been reported for other plant legumains, AtLEGβ is the first example of a plant legumain capable of linking free termini. The discovery of these isoform-specific differences will allow us to identify and rationally design efficient ligases with application in biotechnology and drug development."	0

While RIF1/shieldin blocks 5'-3' nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, it remains unclear how PTIP antagonizes HR. Here, we show that mutation of the PTIP interaction site in 53BP1 (S25A) allows sufficient DNA2-dependent end resection to rescue the lethality of BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup> mice, despite increasing RIF1 ""end-blocking"" at DNA damage sites. However, double-mutant cells fail to complete HR, as excessive shieldin activity also inhibits RNF168-mediated loading of PALB2/RAD51.

Here, we investigate how CTD length and disorder influence transcription. We find that length modulates the size and frequency of transcriptional bursting. Disorder is highly conserved and facilitates CTD-CTD interactions, an ability we show is separable from protein sequence and necessary for efficient transcription. We build a data-driven quantitative model, simulations of which recapitulate experiments and support that CTD length promotes initial polymerase recruitment to the promoter and slows down its release from it and that CTD-CTD interactions enable recruitment of multiple polymerases.

"32640240"	"Adipocyte Fatty Acid Transfer Supports Megakaryocyte Maturation.Megakaryocytes (MKs) come from a complex process of hematopoietic progenitor maturation within the bone marrow that gives rise to de novo circulating platelets. Bone marrow microenvironment contains a large number of adipocytes with a still ill-defined role. This study aims to analyze the influence of adipocytes and increased medullar adiposity in megakaryopoiesis. An in vivo increased medullar adiposity in mice caused by high-fat-diet-induced obesity is associated to an enhanced MK maturation and proplatelet formation. In vitro co-culture of adipocytes with bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors shows that delipidation of adipocytes directly supports MK maturation by enhancing polyploidization, amplifying the demarcation membrane system, and accelerating proplatelet formation. This direct crosstalk between adipocytes and MKs occurs through adipocyte fatty acid transfer to MKs involving CD36 to reinforce megakaryocytic maturation. Thus, these findings unveil an influence of adiposity on MK homeostasis based on a dialogue between adipocytes and MKs."	0
"32241803"	"Positive autofeedback regulation of <i>Ptf1a</i> transcription generates the levels of PTF1A required to generate itch circuit neurons.Peripheral somatosensory input is modulated in the dorsal spinal cord by a network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. PTF1A is a transcription factor essential in dorsal neural tube progenitors for specification of these inhibitory neurons. Thus, mechanisms regulating <i>Ptf1a</i> expression are key for generating neuronal circuits underlying somatosensory behaviors. Mutations targeted to distinct <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements for <i>Ptf1a</i> in mice, tested the in vivo contribution of each element individually and in combination. Mutations in an autoregulatory enhancer resulted in reduced levels of PTF1A, and reduced numbers of specific dorsal spinal cord inhibitory neurons, particularly those expressing <i>Pdyn</i> and <i>Gal</i> Although these mutants survive postnatally, at ∼3-5 wk they elicit a severe scratching phenotype. Behaviorally, the mutants have increased sensitivity to itch, but acute sensitivity to other sensory stimuli such as mechanical or thermal pain is unaffected. We demonstrate a requirement for positive transcriptional autoregulatory feedback to attain the level of the neuronal specification factor PTF1A necessary for generating correctly balanced neuronal circuits."	0
"31866147"	"TATA-Box Binding Protein O-GlcNAcylation at T114 Regulates Formation of the B-TFIID Complex and Is Critical for Metabolic Gene Regulation.In eukaryotes, gene expression is performed by three RNA polymerases that are targeted to promoters by molecular complexes. A unique common factor, the TATA-box binding protein (TBP), is thought to serve as a platform to assemble pre-initiation complexes competent for transcription. Here, we describe a novel molecular mechanism of nutrient regulation of gene transcription by dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of TBP. We show that O-GlcNAcylation at T114 of TBP blocks its interaction with BTAF1, hence the formation of the B-TFIID complex, and its dynamic cycling on and off of DNA. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of TBP<sup>T114A</sup> CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells showed that loss of O-GlcNAcylation at T114 increases TBP binding to BTAF1 and directly impacts expression of 408 genes. Lack of O-GlcNAcylation at T114 is associated with a striking reprogramming of cellular metabolism induced by a profound modification of the transcriptome, leading to gross alterations in lipid storage."	0
"32049010"	"Secreted Pyruvate Kinase M2 Promotes Lung Cancer Metastasis through Activating the Integrin Beta1/FAK Signaling Pathway.Cancer cell-derived secretomes have been documented to play critical roles in cancer progression. Intriguingly, alternative extracellular roles of intracellular proteins are involved in various steps of tumor progression, which can offer strategies to fight cancer. Herein, we identify lung cancer progression-associated secretome signatures using mass spectrometry analysis. Among them, PKM2 is verified to be highly expressed and secreted in lung cancer cells and clinical samples. Functional analyses demonstrates that secreted PKM2 facilitates tumor metastasis. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis and functional validation identify integrin β1 as a receptor of secreted PKM2. Mechanistically, secreted PKM2 directly bound to integrin β1 and subsequently activated the FAK/SRC/ERK axis to promote tumor metastasis. Collectively, our findings suggest that PKM2 is a potential serum biomarker for diagnosing lung cancer and that targeting the secreted PKM2-integrin β1 axis can inhibit lung cancer development, which provides evidence of a potential therapeutic strategy in lung cancer."	1
"31940492"	"FBXW7 Confers Radiation Survival by Targeting p53 for Degradation.The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in integrating a wide variety of stress responses. Therefore, p53 levels are precisely regulated by multiple ubiquitin ligases. In this study, we report that FBXW7, a substrate recognition component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ligase, interacts with and targets p53 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation after exposure to ionizing radiation or etoposide. Mechanistically, DNA damage activates ATM to phosphorylate p53 on Ser33 and Ser37, which facilitates the FBXW7 binding and subsequent p53 degradation by SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup>. Inactivation of ATM or SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup> by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown/knockout approaches extends the p53 protein half-life upon DNA damage in an MDM2-independent manner. Biologically, FBXW7 inactivation sensitizes cancer cells to radiation or etoposide by stabilizing p53 to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our study elucidates a mechanism by which FBXW7 confers cancer cell survival during radiotherapy or chemotherapy via p53 targeting."	1

Alveolar macrophages normally act to resolve inflammation, but when dysregulated they can provoke ALI. We demonstrate that monocyte-derived macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages) recruited into the airspace upregulate the anti-inflammatory function of alveolar macrophages by suppressing their stimulator of type 1 interferon gene (STING) signaling. Depletion of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages in mice (macrophage<sup>dep</sup> mice) after endotoxin or after Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes expansion of the inflammatory alveolar macrophage population, leading to neutrophil accumulation, irreversible loss of lung vascular barrier function, and lethality. We show that CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages suppress alveolar macrophage-STING signaling via sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Thus, adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) or STING<sup>-/-</sup>, but not SPHK2<sup>-/-</sup>, CD11b monocytes from murine bone marrow into injured macrophage<sup>dep</sup> mice rescue anti-inflammatory alveolar macrophages and reverse lung vascular injury.

Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses.

"32546482"	"Viperin: An ancient radical SAM enzyme finds its place in modern cellular metabolism and innate immunity.Viperin plays an important and multifaceted role in the innate immune response to viral infection. Viperin is also notable as one of very few radical SAM-dependent enzymes present in higher animals; however, the enzyme appears broadly conserved across all kingdoms of life, which suggests that it represents an ancient defense mechanism against viral infections. Although viperin was discovered some 20 years ago, only recently was the enzyme's structure determined and its catalytic activity elucidated. The enzyme converts CTP to 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP, which functions as novel chain-terminating antiviral nucleotide when misincorporated by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Moreover, in higher animals, viperin interacts with numerous other host and viral proteins, and it is apparent that this complex network of interactions constitutes another important aspect of the protein's antiviral activity. An emerging theme is that viperin appears to facilitate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of some of the proteins it interacts with. Viperin-targeted protein degradation contributes to the antiviral response either by down-regulating various metabolic pathways important for viral replication or by directly targeting viral proteins for degradation. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the structure and catalytic activity of viperin, together with studies investigating the interactions between viperin and its target proteins. These studies have provided detailed insights into the biochemical processes underpinning this unusual enzyme's wide-ranging antiviral activity. We also highlight recent intriguing reports that implicate a broader role for viperin in regulating nonpathological cellular processes, including thermogenesis and protein secretion."	0

To reveal multiple characteristics of HIV-1-producing cells in vivo, we use a hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplanted humanized mouse model infected with GFP-encoding replication-competent HIV-1. We perform multiomics experiments using recently developed technology to identify the features of HIV-1-infected cells. Genome-wide HIV-1 integration-site analysis reveals that productive HIV-1 infection tends to occur in cells with viral integration into transcriptionally active genomic regions. Bulk transcriptome analysis reveals that a high level of viral mRNA is transcribed in HIV-1-infected cells. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis shows the heterogeneity of HIV-1-infected cells, including CXCL13<sup>high</sup> cells and a subpopulation with low expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which can contribute to efficient viral spread in vivo. Our findings describe multiple characteristics of HIV-1-producing cells in vivo, which could provide clues for the development of an HIV-1 cure."	0
"32049006"	"A Switch in Tissue Stem Cell Identity Causes Neuroendocrine Tumors in Drosophila Gut.Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are able to generate gut-specific enterocytes, as well as neural-like enteroendocrine cells. It is unclear how the tissue identity of the ISC lineage is regulated to confer cell-lineage fidelity. Here, we show that, in adult Drosophila midgut, loss of the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack in ISCs causes a self-renewal program switch to neural stem cell (NSC)-like, and that switch drives neuroendocrine tumor development. In Tramtrack-depleted ISCs, the ectopically expressed Deadpan acts as a major self-renewal factor for cell propagation, and Sequoia acts as a differentiation factor for the neuroendocrine phenotype. In addition, the expression of Sequoia renders NSC-specific self-renewal genes responsive to Notch in ISCs, thus inverting the differentiation-promoting function of Notch into a self-renewal role as in normal NSCs. These results suggest an active maintenance mechanism for the gut identity of ISCs, whose disruption may lead to an improper acquisition of NSC-like traits and tumorigenesis."	0
"30581145"	"The Solution Structure of FUS Bound to RNA Reveals a Bipartite Mode of RNA Recognition with Both Sequence and Shape Specificity.Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA binding protein involved in regulating many aspects of RNA processing and linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. Transcriptomics studies indicate that FUS binds a large variety of RNA motifs, suggesting that FUS RNA binding might be quite complex. Here, we present solution structures of FUS zinc finger (ZnF) and RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains bound to RNA. These structures show a bipartite binding mode of FUS comprising of sequence-specific recognition of a NGGU motif via the ZnF and an unusual shape recognition of a stem-loop RNA via the RRM. In addition, sequence-independent interactions via the RGG repeats significantly increase binding affinity and promote destabilization of structured RNA conformation, enabling additional binding. We further show that disruption of the RRM and ZnF domains abolishes FUS function in splicing. Altogether, our results rationalize why deciphering the RNA binding mode of FUS has been so challenging."	0
"32101700"	"Mouse Heterochromatin Adopts Digital Compaction States without Showing Hallmarks of HP1-Driven Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation.The formation of silenced and condensed heterochromatin foci involves enrichment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). HP1 can bridge chromatin segments and form liquid droplets, but the biophysical principles underlying heterochromatin compartmentalization in the cell nucleus are elusive. Here, we assess mechanistically relevant features of pericentric heterochromatin compaction in mouse fibroblasts. We find that (1) HP1 has only a weak capacity to form liquid droplets in living cells; (2) the size, global accessibility, and compaction of heterochromatin foci are independent of HP1; (3) heterochromatin foci lack a separated liquid HP1 pool; and (4) heterochromatin compaction can toggle between two ""digital"" states depending on the presence of a strong transcriptional activator. These findings indicate that heterochromatin foci resemble collapsed polymer globules that are percolated with the same nucleoplasmic liquid as the surrounding euchromatin, which has implications for our understanding of chromatin compartmentalization and its functional consequences."	0
"32882183"	"Genetic Characterization of Three Distinct Mechanisms Supporting RNA-Driven DNA Repair and Modification Reveals Major Role of DNA Polymerase ζ.DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are dangerous lesions threatening genomic stability. Fidelity of DSB repair is best achieved by recombination with a homologous template sequence. In yeast, transcript RNA was shown to template DSB repair of DNA. However, molecular pathways of RNA-driven repair processes remain obscure. Utilizing assays of RNA-DNA recombination with and without an induced DSB in yeast DNA, we characterize three forms of RNA-mediated genomic modifications: RNA- and cDNA-templated DSB repair (R-TDR and c-TDR) using an RNA transcript or a DNA copy of the RNA transcript for DSB repair, respectively, and a new mechanism of RNA-templated DNA modification (R-TDM) induced by spontaneous or mutagen-induced breaks. While c-TDR requires reverse transcriptase, translesion DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ) plays a major role in R-TDR, and it is essential for R-TDM. This study characterizes mechanisms of RNA-DNA recombination, uncovering a role of Pol ζ in transferring genetic information from transcript RNA to DNA."	0

"32268122"	"Differentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are critical for continued cellular replacement in the adult brain. Lifelong maintenance of a functional NSPC pool necessitates stringent mechanisms to preserve a pristine proteome. We find that the NSPC chaperone network robustly maintains misfolded protein solubility and stress resilience through high levels of the ATP-dependent chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Strikingly, NSPC differentiation rewires the cellular chaperone network, reducing TRiC/CCT levels and inducing those of the ATP-independent small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). This switches the proteostasis strategy in neural progeny cells to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into protective inclusions. The chaperone network of NSPCs is more effective than that of differentiated cells, leading to improved management of proteotoxic stress and amyloidogenic proteins. However, NSPC proteostasis is impaired by brain aging. The less efficient chaperone network of differentiated neural progeny may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation."	0
"32187533"	"A Model of Differential Mammary Growth Initiation by Stat3 and Asymmetric Integrin-α6 Inheritance.Multiple cancer-related genes both promote and paradoxically suppress growth initiation, depending on the cell context. We discover an explanation for how this occurs for one such protein, Stat3, based on asymmetric cell division. Here, we show that Stat3, by Stathmin/PLK-1, regulates mitotic spindle orientation, and we use it to create and test a model for differential growth initiation. We demonstrate that Integrin-α6 is polarized and required for mammary growth initiation. Spindles orient relative to polar Integrin-α6, dividing perpendicularly in normal cells and parallel in tumor-derived cells, resulting in asymmetric or symmetric Integrin-α6 inheritance, respectively. Stat3 inhibition randomizes spindle orientation, which promotes normal growth initiation while reducing tumor-derived growth initiation. Lipid raft disruption depolarizes Integrin-α6, inducing spindle-orientation-independent Integrin-α6 inheritance. Stat3 inhibition no longer affects the growth of these cells, suggesting Stat3 acts through the regulation of spindle orientation to control growth initiation."	0
"32017896"	"LARP7-Mediated U6 snRNA Modification Ensures Splicing Fidelity and Spermatogenesis in Mice.U6 snRNA, as an essential component of the catalytic core of the pre-mRNA processing spliceosome, is heavily modified post-transcriptionally, with 2'-O-methylation being most common. The role of these modifications in pre-mRNA splicing as well as their physiological function in mammals have remained largely unclear. Here we report that the La-related protein LARP7 functions as a critical cofactor for 2'-O-methylation of U6 in mouse male germ cells. Mechanistically, LARP7 promotes U6 loading onto box C/D snoRNP, facilitating U6 2'-O-methylation by box C/D snoRNP. Importantly, ablation of LARP7 in the male germline causes defective U6 2'-O-methylation, massive alterations in pre-mRNA splicing, and spermatogenic failure in mice, which can be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type LARP7 but not an U6-loading-deficient mutant LARP7. Our data uncover a novel role of LARP7 in regulating U6 2'-O-methylation and demonstrate the functional requirement of such modification for splicing fidelity and spermatogenesis in mice."	1
"32023451"	"A Positive Feedback Loop of TET3 and TGF-β1 Promotes Liver Fibrosis.Pathological activation of TGF-β signaling is universal in fibrosis. Aberrant TGF-β signaling in conjunction with transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into fibrogenic myofibroblasts plays a central role in liver fibrosis. Here we report that the DNA demethylase TET3 is anomalously upregulated in fibrotic livers in both humans and mice. We demonstrate that in human HSCs, TET3 promotes profibrotic gene expression by upregulation of multiple key TGF-β pathway genes, including TGFB1. TET3 binds to target gene promoters, inducing demethylation, which in turn facilitates chromatin remodeling and transcription. We also reveal a positive feedback loop between TGF-β1 and TET3 in both HSCs and hepatocytes. Furthermore, TET3 knockdown ameliorates liver fibrosis in mice. Our results uncover a TET3/TGF-β1 positive feedback loop as a crucial determinant of liver fibrosis and suggest that inhibiting TET3 may represent a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis and perhaps other fibrotic diseases."	1
"31735643"	"Dynamic Regulation of ME1 Phosphorylation and Acetylation Affects Lipid Metabolism and Colorectal Tumorigenesis.PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis."	1

We report that SAMHD1, a phosphohydrolase degrading deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), protects cells against the effects of dNTP imbalances. SAMHD1-deficient cells induce intrinsic apoptosis upon provision of deoxyribonucleosides, particularly deoxyguanosine (dG). Moreover, dG and forodesine act synergistically to kill cells lacking SAMHD1. Using mass cytometry, we find that these compounds kill SAMHD1-deficient malignant cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Normal cells and CLL cells from patients without SAMHD1 mutation are unaffected. We therefore propose to use forodesine as a precision medicine for leukemia, stratifying patients by SAMHD1 genotype or expression."	0

Core genes are hypothesized to directly regulate disease and may serve as therapeutic targets. Using a cell-type- and time-point-specific gene co-expression network for mineralizing osteoblasts, we identify a co-expression module enriched for genes implicated by bone mineral density (BMD) genome-wide association studies (GWASs), correlated with in vitro osteoblast mineralization and associated with skeletal phenotypes in human monogenic disease and mouse knockouts. Four genes from this module (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) are located within the BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and exhibit altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting that they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans.

"30772175"	"PINK1 Inhibits Local Protein Synthesis to Limit Transmission of Deleterious Mitochondrial DNA Mutations.We have previously proposed that selective inheritance, the limited transmission of damaging mtDNA mutations from mother to offspring, is based on replication competition in Drosophila melanogaster. This model, which stems from our observation that wild-type mitochondria propagate much more vigorously in the fly ovary than mitochondria carrying fitness-impairing mutations, implies that germ cells recognize the fitness of individual mitochondria and selectively boost the propagation of healthy ones. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase PINK1 preferentially accumulates on mitochondria enriched for a deleterious mtDNA mutation. PINK1 phosphorylates Larp to inhibit protein synthesis on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Impaired local translation on defective mitochondria in turn limits the replication of their mtDNA and hence the transmission of deleterious mutations to the offspring. Our work confirms that selective inheritance occurs at the organelle level during Drosophila oogenesis and provides molecular entry points to test this model in other systems."	0

"32402290"	"Iterative Single-Cell Analyses Define the Transcriptome of the First Functional Hematopoietic Stem Cells.Whereas hundreds of cells in the mouse embryonic aorta transdifferentiate to hematopoietic cells, only very few establish hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) identity at a single time point. The Gata2 transcription factor is essential for HSC generation and function. In contrast to surface-marker-based cell isolation, Gata2-based enrichment provides a direct link to the internal HSC regulatory network. Here, we use iterations of index-sorting of Gata2-expressing intra-aortic hematopoietic cluster (IAHC) cells, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional analyses to connect HSC identity to specific gene expression. Gata2-expressing IAHC cells separate into 5 major transcriptomic clusters. Iterative analyses reveal refined CD31, cKit, and CD27 phenotypic parameters that associate specific molecular profiles in one cluster with distinct HSC and multipotent progenitor function.

"32615089"	"Disome and Trisome Profiling Reveal Genome-wide Targets of Ribosome Quality Control.The ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) system that resolves stalled translation events is activated when ribosomes collide and form disome, trisome, or higher-order complexes. However, it is unclear whether this system distinguishes collision complexes formed on defective mRNAs from those with functional roles on endogenous transcripts. Here, we performed disome and trisome footprint profiling in yeast and found collisions were enriched on diverse sequence motifs known to slow translation. When 60S recycling was inhibited, disomes accumulated at stop codons and could move into the 3' UTR to reinitiate translation. The ubiquitin ligase and RQC factor Hel2/ZNF598 generally recognized collisions but did not induce degradation of endogenous transcripts. However, loss of Hel2 triggered the integrated stress response, via phosphorylation of eIF2α, thus linking these pathways. Our results suggest that Hel2 has a role in sensing ribosome collisions on endogenous mRNAs, and such events may be important for cellular homeostasis."	0
"30554947"	"Molecular Basis for the Single-Nucleotide Precision of Primary microRNA Processing.Microprocessor, composed of DROSHA and its cofactor DGCR8, initiates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis by processing the primary transcripts of miRNA (pri-miRNAs). Here we investigate the mechanism by which Microprocessor selects the cleavage site with single-nucleotide precision, which is crucial for the specificity and functionality of miRNAs. By testing ∼40,000 pri-miRNA variants, we find that for some pri-miRNAs the cleavage site is dictated mainly by the mGHG motif embedded in the lower stem region of pri-miRNA. Structural modeling and deep-sequencing-based complementation experiments show that the double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of DROSHA recognizes mGHG to place the catalytic center in the appropriate position. The mGHG motif as well as the mGHG-recognizing residues in DROSHA dsRBD are conserved across eumetazoans, suggesting that this mechanism emerged in an early ancestor of the animal lineage. Our findings provide a basis for the understanding of miRNA biogenesis and rational design of accurate small-RNA-based gene silencing."	0

"32521267"	"Stem Cell Determinant SOX9 Promotes Lineage Plasticity and Progression in Basal-like Breast Cancer.Lineage plasticity is important for the development of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), an aggressive cancer subtype. While BLBC is likely to originate from luminal progenitor cells, it acquires substantial basal cell features and contains a heterogenous collection of cells exhibiting basal, luminal, and hybrid phenotypes. Why luminal progenitors are prone to BLBC transformation and what drives luminal-to-basal reprogramming remain unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor SOX9 acts as a determinant for estrogen-receptor-negative (ER<sup>-</sup>) luminal stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs). SOX9 controls LSPC activity in part by activating both canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Inactivation of TP53 and RB via expression of SV40 TAg in a BLBC mouse tumor model leads to upregulation of SOX9, which drives luminal-to-basal reprogramming in vivo. Furthermore, SOX9 deletion inhibits the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-like lesions to invasive carcinoma. These data show that ER<sup>-</sup> LSPC determinant SOX9 acts as a lineage plasticity driver for BLBC progression."	0
"31836388"	"Paradoxical Role for Wild-Type p53 in Driving Therapy Resistance in Melanoma.Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease, despite recent improvements in therapy. Eradicating all melanoma cells even in drug-sensitive tumors is unsuccessful in patients because a subset of cells can transition to a slow-cycling state, rendering them resistant to most targeted therapy. It is still unclear what pathways define these subpopulations and promote this resistant phenotype. In the current study, we show that Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that drives a metastatic, therapy-resistant phenotype, stabilizes the half-life of p53 and uses p53 to initiate a slow-cycling state following stress (DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging). Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow-cycling phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibition. In vivo, this can be accomplished with a single dose of p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating wild-type p53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy."	0

"32610146"	"MZT Proteins Form Multi-Faceted Structural Modules in the γ-Tubulin Ring Complex.Microtubule organization depends on the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a ∼2.3-MDa nucleation factor comprising an asymmetric assembly of γ-tubulin and GCP2-GCP6. However, it is currently unclear how the γ-TuRC-associated microproteins MZT1 and MZT2 contribute to the structure and regulation of the holocomplex. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of MZT1 and MZT2 in the context of the native human γ-TuRC. MZT1 forms two subcomplexes with the N-terminal α-helical domains of GCP3 or GCP6 (GCP-NHDs) within the γ-TuRC ""lumenal bridge."" We determine the X-ray structure of recombinant MZT1/GCP6-NHD and find it is similar to that within the native γ-TuRC. We identify two additional MZT/GCP-NHD-like subcomplexes, one of which is located on the outer face of the γ-TuRC and comprises MZT2 and GCP2-NHD in complex with a centrosomin motif 1 (CM1)-containing peptide. Our data reveal how MZT1 and MZT2 establish multi-faceted, structurally mimetic ""modules"" that can expand structural and regulatory interfaces in the γ-TuRC."	0

As a result, this family of compounds has been significantly expanded through the development of efficient synthetic schemes. However, it is unknown whether all of the members of the rocaglate family act through similar mechanisms of action. Here, we present a comprehensive study comparing the biological activities of >200 rocaglates to better understand how the presence of different chemical entities influences their biological activities. Through this, we find that most rocaglates preferentially repress the translation of mRNAs containing purine-rich 5' leaders, but certain rocaglates lack this bias in translation repression. We also uncover an aspect of rocaglate mechanism of action in which the pool of translationally active eIF4F is diminished due to the sequestration of the complex onto RNA."	0
"30905509"	"Extensive Recovery of Embryonic Enhancer and Gene Memory Stored in Hypomethylated Enhancer DNA.Developing and adult tissues use different cis-regulatory elements. Although DNA at some decommissioned embryonic enhancers is hypomethylated in adult cells, it is unknown whether this putative epigenetic memory is complete and recoverable. We find that, in adult mouse cells, hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides preserve a nearly complete archive of tissue-specific developmental enhancers. Sites that carry the active histone mark H3K4me1, and are therefore considered ""primed,"" are mainly cis elements that act late in organogenesis. In contrast, sites decommissioned early in development retain hypomethylated DNA as a singular property. In adult intestinal and blood cells, sustained absence of polycomb repressive complex 2 indirectly reactivates most-and only-hypomethylated developmental enhancers. Embryonic and fetal transcriptional programs re-emerge as a result, in reverse chronology to cis element inactivation during development. Thus, hypomethylated DNA in adult cells preserves a ""fossil record"" of tissue-specific developmental enhancers, stably marking decommissioned sites and enabling recovery of this epigenetic memory."	0
"31327635"	"Unique Structural Features of the Mitochondrial AAA+ Protease AFG3L2 Reveal the Molecular Basis for Activity in Health and Disease.Mitochondrial AAA+ quality-control proteases regulate diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology through specialized protein degradation, but the underlying mechanisms of these enzymes remain poorly defined. The mitochondrial AAA+ protease AFG3L2 is of particular interest, as genetic mutations localized throughout AFG3L2 are linked to diverse neurodegenerative disorders. However, a lack of structural data has limited our understanding of how mutations impact enzymatic function. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a substrate-bound structure of the catalytic core of human AFG3L2. This structure identifies multiple specialized structural features that integrate with conserved motifs required for ATP-dependent translocation to unfold and degrade targeted proteins. Many disease-relevant mutations localize to these unique structural features of AFG3L2 and distinctly influence its activity and stability. Our results provide a molecular basis for neurological phenotypes associated with different AFG3L2 mutations and establish a structural framework to understand how different members of the AAA+ superfamily achieve specialized biological functions."	0
"30879903"	"MDM2 Integrates Cellular Respiration and Apoptotic Signaling through NDUFS1 and the Mitochondrial Network.Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2."	1
"32690606"	"Tectorigenin enhances PDX1 expression and protects pancreatic β-cells by activating ERK and reducing ER stress.Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) is an important transcription factor that regulates islet β-cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Reduced expression of PDX1 is thought to contribute to β-cell loss and dysfunction in diabetes. Thus, promoting PDX1 expression can be an effective strategy to preserve β-cell mass and function. Previously, we established a <i>PDX1</i> promoter-dependent luciferase system to screen agents that can promote PDX1 expression. Natural compound tectorigenin (TG) was identified as a promising candidate that could enhance the activity of the promoter for the <i>PDX1</i> gene. In this study, we first demonstrated that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in β-cells via activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of ERK; this effect was observed under either normal or glucotoxic/lipotoxic conditions. We then found that TG could suppress induced apoptosis and improved the viability of β-cells under glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by activation of ERK and reduction of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects held true <i>in vivo</i> as well: prophylactic or therapeutic use of TG could obviously inhibit ER stress and decrease islet β-cell apoptosis in the pancreas of mice given a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD), thus dramatically maintaining or restoring β-cell mass and islet size, respectively. Accordingly, both prophylactic and therapeutic use of TG improved HFHSD-impaired glucose metabolism in mice, as evidenced by ameliorating hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Taken together, TG, as an agent promoting PDX1 expression exhibits strong protective effects on islet β-cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."	1

A test bed for examining this question is the tongue dorsum, which harbors a complex and important microbial community. Here, we use multiplexed fluorescence spectral imaging to investigate the organization of the tongue microbiome at micron to hundred-micron scales. We design oligonucleotide probes for taxa both abundant and prevalent, as determined by sequence analysis. Imaging reveals a highly structured spatial organization of microbial consortia, ranging in linear dimension from tens to hundreds of microns. The consortia appear to develop from a core of epithelial cells, with taxa clustering in domains suggestive of clonal expansion. Quantitative proximity analysis provides the basis for a model of tongue dorsum microbiome organization and dynamics. Our work illustrates how high-resolution analysis of micron-scale organization provides insights into physiological functions and microbiome-host interactions."	0
"32641494"	"Modulation of Kv4.2/KChIP3 interaction by the ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 protein CLN3.Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels of the Kv4 subfamily associate with Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs), which leads to enhanced surface expression and shapes the inactivation gating of these channels. KChIP3 has been reported to also interact with the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3 (ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3), which is modified because of gene mutation in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL). The present study was undertaken to find out whether and how CLN3, by its interaction with KChIP3, may indirectly modulate Kv4.2 channel expression and function. To this end, we expressed KChIP3 and CLN3, either individually or simultaneously, together with Kv4.2 in HEK 293 cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found a lower amount of KChIP3 bound to Kv4.2 in the presence of CLN3. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, we examined the effects of CLN3 co-expression on the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels. Simultaneous co-expression of CLN3 and KChIP3 with Kv4.2 resulted in a suppression of the typical KChIP3-mediated modulation; <i>i.e.</i> we observed less increase in current density, less slowing of macroscopic current decay, less acceleration of recovery from inactivation, and a less positively shifted voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. The suppression of the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels was weaker for the JNCL-related missense mutant CLN3<sub>R334C</sub> and for a JNCL-related C-terminal deletion mutant (CLN3ΔC). Our data support the notion that CLN3 is involved in Kv4.2/KChIP3 somatodendritic A-type channel formation, trafficking, and function, a feature that may be lost in JNCL."	0
"32393884"	"Targeted reprogramming of H3K27me3 resets epigenetic memory in plant paternal chromatin.Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in the gametes to reset genomic potential in the next generation. In mammals, paternal chromatin is extensively reprogrammed through the global erasure of DNA methylation and the exchange of histones with protamines<sup>1,2</sup>. Precisely how the paternal epigenome is reprogrammed in flowering plants has remained unclear since DNA is not demethylated and histones are retained in sperm<sup>3,4</sup>. Here, we describe a multi-layered mechanism by which H3K27me3 is globally lost from histone-based sperm chromatin in Arabidopsis. This mechanism involves the silencing of H3K27me3 writers, activity of H3K27me3 erasers and deposition of a sperm-specific histone, H3.10 (ref. <sup>5</sup>), which we show is immune to lysine 27 methylation. The loss of H3K27me3 facilitates the transcription of genes essential for spermatogenesis and pre-configures sperm with a chromatin state that forecasts gene expression in the next generation. Thus, plants have evolved a specific mechanism to simultaneously differentiate male gametes and reprogram the paternal epigenome."	0

"30527665"	"Phosphorylated RB Promotes Cancer Immunity by Inhibiting NF-κB Activation and PD-L1 Expression.Aberrant expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells promotes cancer progression by suppressing cancer immunity. The retinoblastoma protein RB is a tumor suppressor known to regulate the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that RB interacts with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) protein p65 and that their interaction is primarily dependent on CDK4/6-mediated serine-249/threonine-252 (S249/T252) phosphorylation of RB. RNA-seq analysis shows a subset of NF-κB pathway genes including PD-L1 are selectively upregulated by RB knockdown or CDK4/6 inhibitor. S249/T252-phosphorylated RB inversely correlates with PD-L1 expression in patient samples. Expression of a RB-derived S249/T252 phosphorylation-mimetic peptide suppresses radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 and augments therapeutic efficacy of radiation in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of hyperphosphorylated RB in suppressing NF-κB activity and PD-L1 expression and suggest that the RB-NF-κB axis can be exploited to overcome cancer immune evasion triggered by conventional or targeted therapies."	1
"30503774"	"Dynamics of Cas10 Govern Discrimination between Self and Non-self in Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity.Adaptive immune systems must accurately distinguish between self and non-self in order to defend against invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNA to recognize complementary RNA targets, which triggers the degradation of both the invader's transcripts and their template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations but circumvent damage to the host genome. To explore the molecular basis for these features, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10-the DNase effector of the complex-displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Target mutations differentially modulate Cas10 dynamics and tune the CRISPR interference activity in vivo. These findings highlight the central role of the internal dynamics of CRISPR-Cas complexes in self versus non-self discrimination and target specificity."	0
"32101742"	"The Non-dominant AAA+ Ring in the ClpAP Protease Functions as an Anti-stalling Motor to Accelerate Protein Unfolding and Translocation.ATP-powered unfoldases containing D1 and D2 AAA+ rings play important roles in protein homeostasis, but uncertainty about the function of each ring remains. Here we use single-molecule optical tweezers to assay mechanical unfolding and translocation by a variant of the ClpAP protease containing an ATPase-inactive D1 ring. This variant displays substantial mechanical defects in both unfolding and translocation of protein substrates. Notably, when D1 is hydrolytically inactive, ClpAP often stalls for times as long as minutes, and the substrate can back-slip through the enzyme when ATP concentrations are low. The inactive D1 variant also has more difficulty traveling in the N-to-C direction on a polypeptide track than it does moving in a C-to-N direction. These results indicate that D1 normally functions as an auxiliary/regulatory motor to promote uninterrupted enzyme advancement that is fueled largely by the D2 ring."	0
"32268088"	"Passenger Mutations Confound Phenotypes of SARM1-Deficient Mice.The Toll/IL-1R-domain-containing adaptor protein SARM1 is expressed primarily in the brain, where it mediates axonal degeneration. Roles for SARM1 in TLR signaling, viral infection, inflammasome activation, and chemokine and Xaf1 expression have also been described. Much of the evidence for SARM1 function relies on SARM1-deficient mice generated in 129 ESCs and backcrossed to B6. The Sarm1 gene lies in a gene-rich region encompassing Xaf1 and chemokine loci, which remain 129 in sequence. We therefore generated additional knockout strains on the B6 background, confirming the role of SARM1 in axonal degeneration and WNV infection, but not in VSV or LACV infection, or in chemokine or Xaf1 expression. Sequence variation in proapoptotic Xaf1 between B6 and 129 results in coding changes and distinct splice variants, which may account for phenotypes previously attributed to SARM1. Reevaluation of phenotypes in these strains will be critical for understanding the function of SARM1."	0
"31995728"	"AMPK, a Regulator of Metabolism and Autophagy, Is Activated by Lysosomal Damage via a Novel Galectin-Directed Ubiquitin Signal Transduction System.AMPK is a central regulator of metabolism and autophagy. Here we show how lysosomal damage activates AMPK. This occurs via a hitherto unrecognized signal transduction system whereby cytoplasmic sentinel lectins detect membrane damage leading to ubiquitination responses. Absence of Galectin 9 (Gal9) or loss of its capacity to recognize lumenal glycans exposed during lysosomal membrane damage abrogate such ubiquitination responses. Proteomic analyses with APEX2-Gal9 have revealed global changes within the Gal9 interactome during lysosomal damage. Gal9 association with lysosomal glycoproteins increases whereas interactions with a newly identified Gal9 partner, deubiquitinase USP9X, diminishes upon lysosomal injury. In response to damage, Gal9 displaces USP9X from complexes with TAK1 and promotes K63 ubiquitination of TAK1 thus activating AMPK on damaged lysosomes. This triggers autophagy and contributes to autophagic control of membrane-damaging microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, galectin and ubiquitin systems converge to activate AMPK and autophagy during endomembrane homeostasis."	1
"32203421"	"Epigenetic remodelling shapes inflammatory renal cancer and neutrophil-dependent metastasis.Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) frequently causes systemic inflammation. Recent studies have shown that cancer cells reshape the immune landscape by secreting cytokines or chemokines. This phenotype, called cancer-cell-intrinsic inflammation, triggers a metastatic cascade. Here, we identified the functional role and regulatory mechanism of inflammation driven by advanced ccRCC cells. The inflammatory nature of advanced ccRCC was recapitulated in a preclinical model of ccRCC. Amplification of cancer-cell-intrinsic inflammation during ccRCC progression triggered neutrophil-dependent lung metastasis. Massive expression of inflammation-related genes was transcriptionally activated by epigenetic remodelling through mechanisms such as DNA demethylation and super-enhancer formation. A bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor synchronously suppressed C-X-C-type chemokines in ccRCC cells and decreased neutrophil-dependent lung metastasis. Overall, our findings provide insight into the nature of inflammatory ccRCC, which triggers metastatic cascades, and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy."	0
"32619402"	"Structural Insights into Pseudokinase Domains of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.Despite their apparent lack of catalytic activity, pseudokinases are essential signaling molecules. Here, we describe the structural and dynamic properties of pseudokinase domains from the Wnt-binding receptor tyrosine kinases (PTK7, ROR1, ROR2, and RYK), which play important roles in development. We determined structures of all pseudokinase domains in this family and found that they share a conserved inactive conformation in their activation loop that resembles the autoinhibited insulin receptor kinase (IRK). They also have inaccessible ATP-binding pockets, occluded by aromatic residues that mimic a cofactor-bound state. Structural comparisons revealed significant domain plasticity and alternative interactions that substitute for absent conserved motifs. The pseudokinases also showed dynamic properties that were strikingly similar to those of IRK. Despite the inaccessible ATP site, screening identified ATP-competitive type-II inhibitors for ROR1. Our results set the stage for an emerging therapeutic modality of ""conformational disruptors"" to inhibit or modulate non-catalytic functions of pseudokinases deregulated in disease."	0
"31759824"	"MRX Increases Chromatin Accessibility at Stalled Replication Forks to Promote Nascent DNA Resection and Cohesin Loading.The recovery of stalled replication forks depends on the controlled resection of nascent DNA and on the loading of cohesin. These processes operate in the context of nascent chromatin, but the impact of nucleosome structure on a fork restart remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex acts together with the chromatin modifiers Gcn5 and Set1 and the histone remodelers RSC, Chd1, and Isw1 to promote chromatin remodeling at stalled forks. Increased chromatin accessibility facilitates the resection of nascent DNA by the Exo1 nuclease and the Sgs1 and Chl1 DNA helicases. Importantly, increased ssDNA promotes the recruitment of cohesin to arrested forks in a Scc2-Scc4-dependent manner. Altogether, these results indicate that MRX cooperates with chromatin modifiers to orchestrate the action of remodelers, nucleases, and DNA helicases, promoting the resection of nascent DNA and the loading of cohesin, two key processes involved in the recovery of arrested forks."	0
"30772176"	"Demethylation of the Protein Phosphatase PP2A Promotes Demethylation of Histones to Enable Their Function as a Methyl Group Sink.Dysregulation of chromatin methylation is associated with defects in cellular differentiation as well as a variety of cancers. How cells regulate the opposing activities of histone methyltransferase and demethylase enzymes to set the methylation status of the epigenome for proper control of gene expression and metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of methylation of the major phosphatase PP2A in response to methionine starvation activates the demethylation of histones through hyperphosphorylation of specific demethylase enzymes. In parallel, this regulatory mechanism enables cells to preserve SAM by increasing SAH to limit SAM consumption by methyltransferase enzymes. Mutants lacking the PP2A methyltransferase or the effector H3K36 demethylase Rph1 exhibit elevated SAM levels and are dependent on cysteine due to reduced capacity to sink the methyl groups of SAM. Therefore, PP2A directs the methylation status of histones by regulating the phosphorylation status of histone demethylase enzymes in response to SAM levels."	0

The mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation and its contribution to SDH-deficient cancers remain undemonstrated. We examine the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and their correlation with RNA expression in SDHB-deficient tumors and murine Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup> cells. We report that DNA hypermethylation results from TET inhibition. Although it preferentially affects PRC2 targets and known developmental genes, PRC2 activity does not contribute to the DNA hypermethylator phenotype. We also prove, in vitro and in vivo, that TET silencing, although recapitulating the methylation profile of Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup> cells, is not sufficient to drive their EMT-like phenotype, which requires additional HIF2α activation.

"32592682"	"An Insulin-Sensitive Circular RNA that Regulates Lifespan in Drosophila.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and accumulate with age in neurons of diverse species. However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo."	0
"32647010"	"Simplified detection of polyhistidine-tagged proteins in gels and membranes using a UV-excitable dye and a multiple chelator head pair.The polyhistidine tag (His-tag) is one of the most popular protein tags used in the life sciences. Traditionally, the detection of His-tagged proteins relies on immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies. This approach is laborious for certain applications, such as protein purification, where time and simplicity are critical. The His-tag can also be directly detected by metal ion-loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based chelator heads conjugated to fluorophores, which is a convenient alternative method to immunoblotting. Typically, such chelator heads are conjugated to either green or red fluorophores, the detection of which requires specialized excitation sources and detection systems. Here, we demonstrate that post-run staining is ideal for His-tag detection by metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads in PAGE and blot membranes. Additionally, by comparing the performances of different chelator heads, we show how differences in microscopic affinity constants translate to macroscopic differences in the detection limits in environments with limited diffusion, such as PAGE. On the basis of these results, we devise a simple approach, called UVHis-PAGE, that uses metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads to detect His-tagged proteins in PAGE and blot membranes. Our method uses a UV transilluminator as an excitation source, and the results can be visually inspected by the naked eye."	0

We show that TMEM16F is expressed in synaptic clusters facing pre-synaptic cholinergic C-boutons in α-motoneurons of the spinal cord. Mice with targeted exon deletion in Tmem16f display decreased motor performance under high-demanding tasks attributable to an increase in the recruitment threshold of fast α-motoneurons. Remarkably, loss of TMEM16F function in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) significantly reduces expression of an activity-dependent early stress marker and muscle denervation, delays disease onset, and preserves muscular strength only in male ALS mice. Thus, TMEM16F controls motoneuron excitability and impacts motor resistance as well as motor deterioration in ALS."	0
"32807903"	"Decapping enzyme 1A breaks X-chromosome symmetry by controlling Tsix elongation and RNA turnover.How allelic asymmetry is generated remains a major unsolved problem in epigenetics. Here we model the problem using X-chromosome inactivation by developing ""BioRBP"", an enzymatic RNA-proteomic method that enables probing of low-abundance interactions and an allelic RNA-depletion and -tagging system. We identify messenger RNA-decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A) as a key regulator of Tsix, a noncoding RNA implicated in allelic choice through X-chromosome pairing. DCP1A controls Tsix half-life and transcription elongation. Depleting DCP1A causes accumulation of X-X pairs and perturbs the transition to monoallelic Tsix expression required for Xist upregulation. While ablating DCP1A causes hyperpairing, forcing Tsix degradation resolves pairing and enables Xist upregulation. We link pairing to allelic partitioning of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and show that tethering DCP1A to one Tsix allele is sufficient to drive monoallelic Xist expression. Thus, DCP1A flips a bistable switch for the mutually exclusive determination of active and inactive Xs."	1

We here compare molecular features of USP25 and USP28. Active enzymes form distinctively shaped dimers, with a dimerizing insertion spatially separating independently active catalytic domains. In USP25, but not USP28, two dimers can form an autoinhibited tetramer, where a USP25-specific, conserved insertion sequence blocks ubiquitin binding. In full-length enzymes, a C-terminal domain with a previously unknown fold has no impact on oligomerization, but N-terminal regions affect the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in vitro.

Here, we provide evidence that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, inhibition of the conserved unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) mediator, activating transcription factor (atf)-6, increases lifespan by modulating calcium homeostasis and signaling to mitochondria. Atf-6 loss confers longevity via downregulation of the ER calcium buffer, calreticulin. ER calcium release via the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R/itr-1) is required for longevity, while IP<sub>3</sub>R/itr-1 gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan. Highlighting coordination between organelles, the mitochondrial calcium import channel mcu-1 is also required for atf-6 longevity.

"32075773"	"Chaperone-Facilitated Aggregation of Thermo-Sensitive Proteins Shields Them from Degradation during Heat Stress.Cells have developed protein quality-control strategies to manage the accumulation of misfolded substrates during heat stress. Using a soluble reporter of misfolding in fission yeast, Rho1.C17R-GFP, we demonstrate that upon mild heat shock, the reporter collapses in protein aggregate centers (PACs). They contain and/or require several chaperones, such as Hsp104, Hsp16, and the Hsp40/70 couple Mas5/Ssa2. Stress granules do not assemble at mild temperatures and, therefore, are not required for PAC formation; on the contrary, PACs may serve as nucleation centers for the assembly of stress granules. In contrast to the general belief, the dominant fate of these PACs is not degradation, and the aggregated reporter can be disassembled by chaperones and recovers native structure and activity. Using mass spectrometry, we show that thermo-unstable endogenous proteins form PACs as well. In conclusion, formation of PACs during heat shock is a chaperone-mediated adaptation strategy."	0

Rtg1/3 exert control on the expression of several enzymes involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids' building blocks, and the regulators are activated upon engulfment of C. albicans cells by human neutrophils. We demonstrate that Rtg1p and Rtg3p are regulated at two levels, one in response to sphingolipids and the other by the nutrient sensor TOR. Our findings, therefore, indicate that the Rtg1/3 system integrates nutrient sensing into the synthesis of complex lipids."	0
"30527663"	"The Pat1-Lsm Complex Stabilizes ATG mRNA during Nitrogen Starvation-Induced Autophagy.Macroautophagy/autophagy is a key catabolic recycling pathway that requires fine-tuned regulation to prevent pathologies and preserve homeostasis. Here, we report a new post-transcriptional pathway regulating autophagy involving the Pat1-Lsm (Lsm1 to Lsm7) mRNA-binding complex. Under nitrogen-starvation conditions, Pat1-Lsm binds a specific subset of autophagy-related (ATG) transcripts and prevents their 3' to 5' degradation by the exosome complex, leading to ATG mRNA stabilization and accumulation. This process is regulated through Pat1 dephosphorylation, is necessary for the efficient expression of specific Atg proteins, and is required for robust autophagy induction during nitrogen starvation. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first example of ATG transcript regulation via 3' binding factors and exosomal degradation."	0
"32527723"	"Structure and function of a flavin-dependent S-monooxygenase from garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>).Allicin is a component of the characteristic smell and flavor of garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>). A flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) produced by <i>A. sativum</i> (AsFMO) was previously proposed to oxidize <i>S</i>-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC) to alliin, an allicin precursor. Here, we present a kinetic and structural characterization of AsFMO that suggests a possible contradiction to this proposal. Results of steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that AsFMO exhibited negligible activity with SAC; however, the enzyme was highly active with l-cysteine, <i>N</i>-acetyl-l-cysteine, and allyl mercaptan. We found that allyl mercaptan with NADPH was the preferred substrate-cofactor combination. Rapid-reaction kinetic analyses showed that NADPH binds tightly (<i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of ∼2 μm) to AsFMO and that the hydride transfer occurs with pro-<i>R</i> stereospecificity. We detected the formation of a long-wavelength band when AsFMO was reduced by NADPH, probably representing the formation of a charge-transfer complex. In the absence of substrate, the reduced enzyme, in complex with NADP<sup>+</sup>, reacted with oxygen and formed an intermediate with a spectrum characteristic of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, which decays several orders of magnitude more slowly than the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> The presence of substrate enhanced C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formation and, upon hydroxylation, oxidation occurred with a rate constant similar to the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> The structure of AsFMO complexed with FAD at 2.08-Å resolution features two domains for binding of FAD and NADPH, representative of class B flavin monooxygenases. These biochemical and structural results are consistent with AsFMO being an S-monooxygenase involved in allicin biosynthesis through direct formation of sulfenic acid and not SAC oxidation."	0
"31956073"	"Integrin αvβ5 Internalizes Zika Virus during Neural Stem Cells Infection and Provides a Promising Target for Antiviral Therapy.We perform a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screen in glioblastoma stem cells and identify integrin αvβ5 as an internalization factor for Zika virus (ZIKV). Expression of αvβ5 is correlated with ZIKV susceptibility in various cells and tropism in developing human cerebral cortex. A blocking antibody against integrin αvβ5, but not αvβ3, efficiently inhibits ZIKV infection. ZIKV binds to cells but fails to internalize when treated with integrin αvβ5-blocking antibody. αvβ5 directly binds to ZIKV virions and activates focal adhesion kinase, which is required for ZIKV infection. Finally, αvβ5 blocking antibody or two inhibitors, SB273005 and cilengitide, reduces ZIKV infection and alleviates ZIKV-induced pathology in human neural stem cells and in mouse brain. Altogether, our findings identify integrin αvβ5 as an internalization factor for ZIKV, providing a promising therapeutic target, as well as two drug candidates for prophylactic use or treatments for ZIKV infections."	0
"32451440"	"Extracellular serine controls epidermal stem cell fate and tumour initiation.Tissue stem cells are the cell of origin for many malignancies. Metabolites regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, but whether endogenous metabolic pathways or nutrient availability predispose stem cells towards transformation remains unknown. Here, we address this question in epidermal stem cells (EpdSCs), which are a cell of origin for squamous cell carcinoma. We find that oncogenic EpdSCs are serine auxotrophs whose growth and self-renewal require abundant exogenous serine. When extracellular serine is limited, EpdSCs activate de novo serine synthesis, which in turn stimulates α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that remove the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 and activate differentiation programmes. Accordingly, serine starvation or enforced α-ketoglutarate production antagonizes squamous cell carcinoma growth. Conversely, blocking serine synthesis or repressing α-ketoglutarate-driven demethylation facilitates malignant progression. Together, these findings reveal that extracellular serine is a critical determinant of EpdSC fate and provide insight into how nutrient availability is integrated with stem cell fate decisions during tumour initiation."	0
"32521254"	"Sex-Specific Disruption of Distinct mPFC Inhibitory Neurons in Spared-Nerve Injury Model of Neuropathic Pain.The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) modulates a range of behaviors, including responses to noxious stimuli. While various pain modalities alter mPFC function, our understanding of changes to specific cell types underlying pain-induced mPFC dysfunction remains incomplete. Proper activity of cortical GABAergic interneurons is essential for normal circuit function. We find that nerve injury increases excitability of layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the prelimbic (PL) region of the mPFC from male, but not female, mice. Conversely, nerve injury dampens excitability in somatostatin-expressing neurons in layer 2/3 of the PL region; however, effects are differential between males and females. Nerve injury slightly increases the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing neurons in males but reduces frequency of sEPSCs in layer 2/3 somatostatin-expressing neurons in females. Our findings provide key insight into how nerve injury drives maladaptive and sex-specific alterations to GABAergic circuits in cortical regions implicated in chronic pain."	0
"32187559"	"Identification of ALPPL2 as a Naive Pluripotent State-Specific Surface Protein Essential for Human Naive Pluripotency Regulation.Human naive pluripotent stem cells established from the epiblasts of preimplantation blastocysts provide a useful model for mechanistic studies of pluripotency regulation and lineage differentiation. Important advances have been made to optimize culture conditions and define molecular criteria for naive pluripotency. However, the identity of naive-specific surface markers and the underlying molecular mechanism of naive pluripotency regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) as a prominent naive-specific surface marker by systematic proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ALPPL2 is essential for both the establishment and maintenance of naive pluripotency. Moreover, we show that ALPPL2 can interact with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 to stabilize the mRNA levels of the naive pluripotency transcription factors TFCP2L1 and STAT3 to regulate naive pluripotency. Overall, our study identifies a functional surface marker for human naive pluripotency, providing a powerful tool for human-naive-pluripotency-related mechanistic studies."	1
"32636302"	"The molecular basis for immune dysregulation by the hyperactivated E62K mutant of the GTPase RAC2.The RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (RAC2) is a member of the RHO subclass of RAS superfamily GTPases required for proper immune function. An activating mutation in a key switch II region of RAC2 (RAC2<sup>E62K</sup>) involved in recognizing modulatory factors and effectors has been identified in patients with common variable immune deficiency. To better understand how the mutation dysregulates RAC2 function, we evaluated the structure and stability, guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, and effector binding of RAC2<sup>E62K</sup> Our findings indicate the E62K mutation does not alter RAC2 structure or stability. However, it does alter GEF specificity, as RAC2<sup>E62K</sup> is activated by the DOCK GEF, DOCK2, but not by the Dbl homology GEF, TIAM1, both of which activate the parent protein. Our previous data further showed that the E62K mutation impairs GAP activity for RAC2<sup>E62K</sup> As this disease mutation is also found in RAS GTPases, we assessed GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis for KRAS and observed a similar impairment, suggesting that the mutation plays a conserved role in GAP activation. We also investigated whether the E62K mutation alters effector binding, as activated RAC2 binds effectors to transmit signaling through effector pathways. We find that RAC2<sup>E62K</sup> retains binding to an NADPH oxidase (NOX2) subunit, p67<sup>phox</sup>, and to the RAC-binding domain of p21-activated kinase, consistent with our earlier findings. Taken together, our findings indicate that the RAC2<sup>E62K</sup> mutation promotes immune dysfunction by promoting RAC2 hyperactivation, altering GEF specificity, and impairing GAP function yet retaining key effector interactions."	0
"30595437"	"The Translation Inhibitor Rocaglamide Targets a Bimolecular Cavity between eIF4A and Polypurine RNA.A class of translation inhibitors, exemplified by the natural product rocaglamide A (RocA), isolated from Aglaia genus plants, exhibits antitumor activity by clamping eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) onto polypurine sequences in mRNAs. This unusual inhibitory mechanism raises the question of how the drug imposes sequence selectivity onto a general translation factor. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1⋅ATP analog⋅RocA⋅polypurine RNA complex. RocA targets the ""bi-molecular cavity"" formed characteristically by eIF4A1 and a sharply bent pair of consecutive purines in the RNA. Natural amino acid substitutions found in Aglaia eIF4As changed the cavity shape, leading to RocA resistance. This study provides an example of an RNA-sequence-selective interfacial inhibitor fitting into the space shaped cooperatively by protein and RNA with specific sequences."	0
"30503775"	"Widespread Backtracking by RNA Pol II Is a Major Effector of Gene Activation, 5' Pause Release, Termination, and Transcription Elongation Rate.In addition to phosphodiester bond formation, RNA polymerase II has an RNA endonuclease activity, stimulated by TFIIS, which rescues complexes that have arrested and backtracked. How TFIIS affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIIS<sub>DN</sub>) that inhibits RNA cleavage and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow elongation early in transcription, and in 3' flanking regions where termination is enhanced by TFIIS<sub>DN</sub>, suggesting that backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination. Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes. TFIIS<sub>DN</sub> slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of elongation under normal conditions."	0
"32460010"	"Individual Control and Quantification of 3D Spheroids in a High-Density Microfluidic Droplet Array.As three-dimensional cell culture formats gain in popularity, there emerges a need for tools that produce vast amounts of data on individual cells within the spheroids or organoids. Here, we present a microfluidic platform that provides access to such data by parallelizing the manipulation of individual spheroids within anchored droplets. Different conditions can be applied in a single device by triggering the merging of new droplets with the spheroid-containing drops. This allows cell-cell interactions to be initiated for building microtissues, studying stem cells' self-organization, or observing antagonistic interactions. It also allows the spheroids' physical or chemical environment to be modulated, as we show by applying a drug over a large range of concentrations in a single parallelized experiment. This convergence of microfluidics and image acquisition leads to a data-driven approach that allows the heterogeneity of 3D culture behavior to be addressed across the scales, bridging single-cell measurements with population measurements."	0
"31983508"	"Maintaining Iron Homeostasis Is the Key Role of Lysosomal Acidity for Cell Proliferation.The lysosome is an acidic multi-functional organelle with roles in macromolecular digestion, nutrient sensing, and signaling. However, why cells require acidic lysosomes to proliferate and which nutrients become limiting under lysosomal dysfunction are unclear. To address this, we performed CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens and identified cholesterol biosynthesis and iron uptake as essential metabolic pathways when lysosomal pH is altered. While cholesterol synthesis is only necessary, iron is both necessary and sufficient for cell proliferation under lysosomal dysfunction. Remarkably, iron supplementation restores cell proliferation under both pharmacologic and genetic-mediated lysosomal dysfunction. The rescue was independent of metabolic or signaling changes classically associated with increased lysosomal pH, uncoupling lysosomal function from cell proliferation. Finally, our experiments revealed that lysosomal dysfunction dramatically alters mitochondrial metabolism and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling due to iron depletion. Altogether, these findings identify iron homeostasis as the key function of lysosomal acidity for cell proliferation."	0
"32532796"	"A myelin basic protein fragment induces sexually dimorphic transcriptome signatures of neuropathic pain in mice.In the peripheral nerve, mechanosensitive axons are insulated by myelin, a multilamellar membrane formed by Schwann cells. Here, we offer first evidence that a myelin degradation product induces mechanical hypersensitivity and global transcriptomics changes in a sex-specific manner. Focusing on downstream signaling events of the functionally active 84-104 myelin basic protein (MBP(84-104)) fragment released after nerve injury, we demonstrate that exposing the sciatic nerve to MBP(84-104) via endoneurial injection produces robust mechanical hypersensitivity in female, but not in male, mice. RNA-seq and systems biology analysis revealed a striking sexual dimorphism in molecular signatures of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord response, not observed at the nerve injection site. Mechanistically, intra-sciatic MBP(84-104) induced phospholipase C (PLC)-driven (females) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-driven (males) phospholipid metabolism (tier 1). PLC/inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and estrogen receptor co-regulation in spinal cord yielded Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nociceptive signaling induction in females that was suppressed in males (tier 2). IP3R inactivation by intrathecal xestospongin C attenuated the female-specific hypersensitivity induced by MBP(84-104). According to sustained sensitization in tiers 1 and 2, T cell-related signaling spreads to the DRG and spinal cord in females, but remains localized to the sciatic nerve in males (tier 3). These results are consistent with our previous finding that MBP(84-104)-induced pain is T cell-dependent. In summary, an autoantigenic peptide endogenously released in nerve injury triggers multisite, sex-specific transcriptome changes, leading to neuropathic pain only in female mice. MBP(84-104) acts through sustained co-activation of metabolic, estrogen receptor-mediated nociceptive, and autoimmune signaling programs."	0
"32492418"	"Regional Variation in Epidermal Susceptibility to UV-Induced Carcinogenesis Reflects Proliferative Activity of Epidermal Progenitors.To better understand the influence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on the initial steps of skin carcinogenesis, we examine patches of labeled keratinocytes as a proxy for clones in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and measure their size variation upon UVB irradiation. Multicolor lineage tracing reveals that in chronically irradiated skin, patches near hair follicles (HFs) increase in size, whereas those far from follicles do not change. This is explained by proliferation of basal epidermal cells within 60 μm of HF openings. Upon interruption of UVB, patch size near HFs regresses significantly. These anatomical differences in proliferative behavior have significant consequences for the cell of origin of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Indeed, a UV-inducible murine BCC model shows that BCC patches are more frequent, larger, and more invasive near HFs. These findings have major implications for the prevention of field cancerization in the epidermis."	0
"32493770"	"Cross-utilization of β-galactosides and cellobiose in <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i>.Strains of the Gram-positive, thermophilic bacterium <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i> possess elaborate systems for the utilization of hemicellulolytic polysaccharides, including xylan, arabinan, and galactan. These systems have been studied extensively in strains T-1 and T-6, representing microbial models for the utilization of soil polysaccharides, and many of their components have been characterized both biochemically and structurally. Here, we characterized routes by which <i>G. stearothermophilus</i> utilizes mono- and disaccharides such as galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and galactosyl-glycerol. The <i>G. stearothermophilus</i> genome encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) for cellobiose. We found that the cellobiose-PTS system is induced by cellobiose and characterized the corresponding GH1 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, Cel1A. The bacterium also possesses two transport systems for galactose, a galactose-PTS system and an ABC galactose transporter. The ABC galactose transport system is regulated by a three-component sensing system. We observed that both systems, the sensor and the transporter, utilize galactose-binding proteins that also bind glucose with the same affinity. We hypothesize that this allows the cell to control the flux of galactose into the cell in the presence of glucose. Unexpectedly, we discovered that <i>G. stearothermophilus</i> T-1 can also utilize lactose and galactosyl-glycerol via the cellobiose-PTS system together with a bifunctional 6-phospho-β-gal/glucosidase, Gan1D. Growth curves of strain T-1 growing in the presence of cellobiose, with either lactose or galactosyl-glycerol, revealed initially logarithmic growth on cellobiose and then linear growth supported by the additional sugars. We conclude that Gan1D allows the cell to utilize residual galactose-containing disaccharides, taking advantage of the promiscuity of the cellobiose-PTS system."	0
"32348780"	"A Family of Argonaute-Interacting Proteins Gates Nuclear RNAi.Nuclear RNA interference (RNAi) pathways work together with histone modifications to regulate gene expression and enact an adaptive response to transposable RNA elements. In the germline, nuclear RNAi can lead to trans-generational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) of gene silencing. We identified and characterized a family of nuclear Argonaute-interacting proteins (ENRIs) that control the strength and target specificity of nuclear RNAi in C. elegans, ensuring faithful inheritance of epigenetic memories. ENRI-1/2 prevent misloading of the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 with small RNAs that normally effect maternal piRNAs, which prevents precocious nuclear translocation of NRDE-3 in the early embryo. Additionally, they are negative regulators of nuclear RNAi triggered from exogenous sources. Loss of ENRI-3, an unstable protein expressed mostly in the male germline, misdirects the RNAi response to transposable elements and impairs TEI. The ENRIs determine the potency and specificity of nuclear RNAi responses by gating small RNAs into specific nuclear Argonautes."	1

"32459988"	"Biomarker-Guided Development of DNA Repair Inhibitors.Anti-cancer drugs targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) exploit genetic or functional defects in this pathway through synthetic lethal mechanisms. For example, defects in homologous recombination (HR) repair arise in cancer cells through inherited or acquired mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes in the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway, and these tumors have been shown to be particularly sensitive to inhibitors of the base excision repair (BER) protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Recent work has identified additional genomic and functional assays of DNA repair that provide new predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for these targeted therapies. Here, we examine the development of selective agents targeting DNA repair, including PARP inhibitors; inhibitors of the DNA damage kinases ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), CHK1, WEE1, and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM); and inhibitors of classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) and alternative end joining (Alt EJ).

"31785928"	"Immunosuppression by Mutated Calreticulin Released from Malignant Cells.Mutations affecting exon 9 of the CALR gene lead to the generation of a C-terminally modified calreticulin (CALR) protein that lacks the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal and consequently mislocalizes outside of the ER where it activates the thrombopoietin receptor in a cell-autonomous fashion, thus driving myeloproliferative diseases. Here, we used the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) assay to monitor the trafficking of CALR. We found that exon-9-mutated CALR was released from cells in response to the biotin-mediated detachment from its ER-localized hook, in vitro and in vivo. Cellular CALR release was confirmed in suitable mouse models bearing exon-9-mutated hematopoietic systems or tumors. Extracellular CALR mediated immunomodulatory effects and inhibited the phagocytosis of dying cancer cells by dendritic cells (DC), thereby suppressing antineoplastic immune responses elicited by chemotherapeutic agents or by PD-1 blockade. Altogether, our results demonstrate paracrine immunosuppressive effects for exon-9-mutated CALR."	0

"32518161"	"Loss of the RNA-binding protein Rbm15 disrupts liver maturation in zebrafish.Liver organogenesis begins with hepatic precursors in the foregut endoderm, followed by hepatoblast specification, differentiation, outgrowth, and maturation for the formation of functional hepatocytes. Although several signaling pathways and critical factors that regulate liver specification, differentiation, and proliferation have been identified, little is known about how liver maturation is regulated. Here, we used a screen for mutations affecting liver development in zebrafish and identified a <i>cq96</i> mutant that exhibits a specific defect in liver maturation. Results from positional cloning revealed that <i>cq96</i> encodes an RNA-binding protein, Rbm15, which is an evolutionarily conserved Spen family protein and known to play a crucial role in RNA m6A modification, nuclear export, and alternative splicing. However, a function of Rbm15 in embryonic liver development has not been reported. We found that <i>Rbm15</i> is specifically expressed in the liver after its differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of <i>rbm15</i> repressed hepatic maturation, but did not affect hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in <i>rbm15</i>-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin treatment partially restored normal hepatic gene expression as well as the nuclear location of the transcription factor Hnf4a. Taken together, these results reveal an unexpected role of Rbm15 in liver maturation."	0
"30982745"	"Dual Role of Ribosome-Binding Domain of NAC as a Potent Suppressor of Protein Aggregation and Aging-Related Proteinopathies.The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factor. Whether NAC exerts chaperone activity and whether this function is restricted to de novo protein synthesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NAC directly exerts chaperone activity toward structurally diverse model substrates including polyglutamine (PolyQ) proteins, firefly luciferase, and Aβ40. Strikingly, we identified the positively charged ribosome-binding domain in the N terminus of the βNAC subunit (N-βNAC) as a major chaperone entity of NAC. N-βNAC by itself suppressed aggregation of PolyQ-expanded proteins in vitro, and the positive charge of this domain was critical for this activity. Moreover, we found that NAC also exerts a ribosome-independent chaperone function in vivo. Consistently, we found that a substantial fraction of NAC is non-ribosomal bound in higher eukaryotes. In sum, NAC is a potent suppressor of aggregation and proteotoxicity of mutant PolyQ-expanded proteins associated with human diseases like Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias."	0
"32460028"	"Expression of RUNX1-ETO Rapidly Alters the Chromatin Landscape and Growth of Early Human Myeloid Precursor Cells.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by recurrent mutations in genes encoding transcriptional, chromatin, and/or signaling regulators. The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1), which by itself is insufficient to cause disease. t(8;21) AML patients show extensive chromatin reprogramming and have acquired additional mutations. Therefore, the genomic and developmental effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this, we employ a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding, blocks differentiation, and arrests cellular growth, whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal. Single-cell gene expression analyses show that RUNX1-ETO induction alters the differentiation of early myeloid progenitors, but not of other progenitor types, indicating that oncoprotein-mediated transcriptional reprogramming is highly target cell specific."	0

With the global population set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, and the compounding effects of climate change, the planet is facing challenges that necessitate significant and rapid changes in agricultural practices. In the effort to provide food in terms of calories, the essential contribution of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to nutrition is often overlooked. Here, we focus on the importance of thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) in plant health and discuss its impact on human health. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is an essential dietary component, and deficiencies in this micronutrient underlie several diseases, notably nervous system disorders. The predominant source of dietary vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is plant-based foods. Moreover, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also vital for plants themselves, and its benefits in plant health have received less attention than in the human health sphere. In general, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is well-characterized for its role as a coenzyme in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in energy production and central metabolism, including carbon assimilation and respiration. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also emerging as an important component of plant stress responses, and several noncoenzyme roles of this vitamin are being characterized. We summarize the importance of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> in plants from the perspective of food security, including its roles in plant disease resistance, stress tolerance, and crop yield, and review the potential benefits of biofortification of crops with increased vitamin B<sub>1</sub> content to improve human health."	0
"32905765"	"INO80C Remodeler Maintains Genomic Stability by Preventing Promiscuous Transcription at Replication Origins.The proper coordination of transcription with DNA replication and repair is central for genomic stability. We investigate how the INO80C chromatin remodeling enzyme might coordinate these genomic processes. We find that INO80C co-localizes with the origin recognition complex (ORC) at yeast replication origins and is bound to replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In yeast, INO80C recruitment requires origin sequences but does not require ORC, suggesting that recruitment is independent of pre-replication complex assembly. In both yeast and ESCs, INO80C co-localizes at origins with Mot1 and NC2 transcription factors, and genetic studies suggest that they function together to promote genome stability. Interestingly, nascent transcript sequencing demonstrates that INO80C and Mot1 prevent pervasive transcription through origin sequences, and absence of these factors leads to formation of new DNA double-strand breaks. We propose that INO80C and Mot1/NC2 function through distinct pathways to limit origin transcription, maintaining genomic stability."	0
"31327636"	"HokB Monomerization and Membrane Repolarization Control Persister Awakening.Every bacterial population harbors a small subpopulation of so-called persisters that are transiently antibiotic tolerant. These persisters are associated with the recalcitrance of chronic infections because they can recolonize the host after antibiotic removal. Although several effectors have been described to induce persistence, persister cell awakening is poorly understood. We previously reported that the toxin HokB induces persistence via pore formation, resulting in membrane depolarization and ATP leakage. We now delineate mechanisms responsible for the awakening of HokB-induced persisters. We show that HokB dimerization by the oxidoreductase DsbA is essential for pore formation and peptide stability. Pores are disassembled via DsbC-mediated monomerization, which targets HokB for DegQ-mediated degradation. Finally, pore disassembly allows membrane repolarization by the electron transport chain, supporting cells to resume growth. These results provide a detailed view of both the formation and awakening of HokB-induced persister cells."	0

However, the role of Maidong polysaccharide extract (MPE) in pancreatic β-cell function is unclear. Here, we investigated whether MPE protects β-cell function and studied the underlying mechanisms. We treated <i>db/db</i> and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with 800 or 400 mg/kg MPE or water for 4 weeks, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Pancreas and blood were collected for molecular analyses, and clonal MIN6 β-cells and primary islets from HFD-induced obese mice and normal chow diet-fed mice were used in additional analyses. <i>In vivo</i>, MPE both increased insulin secretion and reduced blood glucose in the <i>db/db</i> mice but increased only insulin secretion in the HFD-induced obese mice. MPE substantially increased the β-cell area in both models (3-fold and 2-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.01, for <i>db/db</i> and HFD mice, respectively). We observed reduced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in islets of MPE-treated db/db mice, coinciding with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). <i>In vitro</i>, MPE potentiated GSIS and decreased interleukin 1β (IL-1β) secretion in MIN6 β-cells. Incubation of MIN6 cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon-γ, and IL-1β amplified IL-1β secretion and inhibited GSIS. These effects were partially reversed with MPE or the IκB kinase β inhibitor PS1145, coinciding with reduced activation of p65 and p-IκB in the NF-κB pathway. We conclude that MPE may have potential for therapeutic development for β-cell protection."	0

However, the molecular mechanisms of lung metastasis of osteosarcoma remain poorly understood. Here we identify exon-intron fusion genes in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. These fusion genes are derived from chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the coding region for amino acids 1-38 of Rab22a (Rab22a<sup>1-38</sup>) with multiple inverted introns and untranslated regions of chromosome 20. The resulting translation products, designated Rab22a-NeoFs, acquire the ability to drive lung metastasis of osteosarcoma. The Rab22a<sup>1-38</sup> moiety governs the function of Rab22a-NeoFs by binding to SmgGDS-607, a GTP-GDP exchange factor of RhoA. This association facilitates the release of GTP-bound RhoA from SmgGDS-607, which induces increased activity of RhoA and promotes metastasis. Disrupting the interaction between Rab22a-NeoF1 and SmgGDS-607 with a synthetic peptide prevents lung metastasis in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma. Our findings may provide a promising strategy for a subset of osteosarcoma patients with lung metastases."	0
"32610139"	"Atrx Deletion in Neurons Leads to Sexually Dimorphic Dysregulation of miR-137 and Spatial Learning and Memory Deficits.ATRX gene mutations have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disabilities in humans. ATRX is known to maintain genomic stability in neuroprogenitor cells, but its function in differentiated neurons and memory processes remains largely unresolved. Here, we show that the deletion of neuronal Atrx in mice leads to distinct hippocampal structural defects, fewer presynaptic vesicles, and an enlarged postsynaptic area at CA1 apical dendrite-axon junctions. We identify male-specific impairments in long-term contextual memory and in synaptic gene expression, linked to altered miR-137 levels. We show that ATRX directly binds to the miR-137 locus and that the enrichment of the suppressive histone mark H3K27me3 is significantly reduced upon the loss of ATRX. We conclude that the ablation of ATRX in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to sexually dimorphic effects on miR-137 expression and on spatial memory, identifying a potential therapeutic target for neurological defects caused by ATRX dysfunction."	1
"32268084"	"Genome-wide Screens Implicate Loss of Cullin Ring Ligase 3 in Persistent Proliferation and Genome Instability in TP53-Deficient Cells.TP53 deficiency is the most common alteration in cancer; however, this alone is typically insufficient to drive tumorigenesis. To identify genes promoting tumorigenesis in combination with TP53 deficiency, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens coupled with proliferation and transformation assays in isogenic cell lines. Loss of several known tumor suppressors enhances cellular proliferation and transformation. Loss of neddylation pathway genes promotes uncontrolled proliferation exclusively in TP53-deficient cells. Combined loss of CUL3 and TP53 activates an oncogenic transcriptional program governed by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), AP-1, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways. This program maintains persistent cellular proliferation, induces partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and increases DNA damage, genomic instability, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings reveal CUL3 loss as a key event stimulating persistent proliferation in TP53-deficient cells. These findings may be clinically relevant, since TP53-CUL3-deficient cells are highly sensitive to ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibition, exposing a vulnerability that could be exploited for cancer treatment."	0
"31932164"	"Structure and Mechanism of a Cyclic Trinucleotide-Activated Bacterial Endonuclease Mediating Bacteriophage Immunity.Bacteria possess an array of defenses against foreign invaders, including a broadly distributed bacteriophage defense system termed CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system). In CBASS systems, a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase synthesizes cyclic di- or tri-nucleotide second messengers in response to infection, and these molecules activate diverse effectors to mediate bacteriophage immunity via abortive infection. Here, we show that the CBASS effector NucC is related to restriction enzymes but uniquely assembles into a homotrimer. Binding of NucC trimers to a cyclic tri-adenylate second messenger promotes assembly of a NucC homohexamer competent for non-specific double-strand DNA cleavage. In infected cells, NucC activation leads to complete destruction of the bacterial chromosome, causing cell death prior to completion of phage replication. In addition to CBASS systems, we identify NucC homologs in over 30 type III CRISPR/Cas systems, where they likely function as accessory nucleases activated by cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers synthesized by these systems' effector complexes."	0
"31995754"	"Critical Role of Lipid Scramblase TMEM16F in Phosphatidylserine Exposure and Repair of Plasma Membrane after Pore Formation.Plasma membrane damage and cell death during processes such as necroptosis and apoptosis result from cues originating intracellularly. However, death caused by pore-forming agents, like bacterial toxins or complement, is due to direct external injury to the plasma membrane. To prevent death, the plasma membrane has an intrinsic repair ability. Here, we found that repair triggered by pore-forming agents involved TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase also mutated in Scott's syndrome. Upon pore formation and the subsequent influx of intracellular calcium, TMEM16F induced rapid ""lipid scrambling"" in the plasma membrane. This response was accompanied by membrane blebbing, extracellular vesicle release, preserved membrane integrity, and increased cell viability. TMEM16F-deficient mice exhibited compromised control of infection by Listeria monocytogenes associated with a greater sensitivity of neutrophils to the pore-forming Listeria toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). Thus, the lipid scramblase TMEM16F is critical for plasma membrane repair after injury by pore-forming agents."	0

Surprisingly, the high-threshold target gene <i>snail</i> only requires Dorsal input early but not late when Dorsal levels peak. Instead, late <i>snail</i> expression can be supported by action of the Twist transcription factor, specifically, through one enhancer, <i>sna.distal</i> This study demonstrates that continuous input is not required for some Dorsal targets and downstream responses, such as <i>twist</i>, function as molecular ratchets."	0
"32905760"	"Brain States and Transitions: Insights from Computational Neuroscience.Within the field of computational neuroscience there are great expectations of finding new ways to rebalance the complex dynamic system of the human brain through controlled pharmacological or electromagnetic perturbation. Yet many obstacles remain between the ability to accurately predict how and where best to perturb to force a transition from one brain state to another. The foremost challenge is a commonly agreed definition of a given brain state. Recent progress in computational neuroscience has made it possible to robustly define brain states and force transitions between them. Here, we review the state of the art and propose a framework for determining the functional hierarchical organization describing any given brain state. We describe the latest advances in creating sophisticated whole-brain computational models with interacting neuronal and neurotransmitter systems that can be studied fully in silico to predict and design novel pharmacological and electromagnetic interventions to rebalance them in disease."	0
"30852060"	"Obstacles to Scanning by RNase E Govern Bacterial mRNA Lifetimes by Hindering Access to Distal Cleavage Sites.The diversity of mRNA lifetimes in bacterial cells is difficult to reconcile with the relaxed cleavage site specificity of RNase E, the endonuclease most important for governing mRNA degradation. This enzyme has generally been thought to locate cleavage sites by searching freely in three dimensions. However, our results now show that its access to such sites in 5'-monophosphorylated RNA is hindered by obstacles-such as bound proteins or ribosomes or coaxial small RNA (sRNA) base pairing-that disrupt the path from the 5' end to those sites and prolong mRNA lifetimes. These findings suggest that RNase E searches for cleavage sites by scanning linearly from the 5'-terminal monophosphate along single-stranded regions of RNA and that its progress is impeded by structural discontinuities encountered along the way. This discovery has major implications for gene regulation in bacteria and suggests a general mechanism by which other prokaryotic and eukaryotic regulatory proteins can be controlled."	0
"32768407"	"The 3D Topography of Mitotic Chromosomes.A long-standing conundrum is how mitotic chromosomes can compact, as required for clean separation to daughter cells, while maintaining close parallel alignment of sister chromatids. Pursuit of this question, by high resolution 3D fluorescence imaging of living and fixed mammalian cells, has led to three discoveries. First, we show that the structural axes of separated sister chromatids are linked by evenly spaced ""mini-axis"" bridges. Second, when chromosomes first emerge as discrete units, at prophase, they are organized as co-oriented sister linear loop arrays emanating from a conjoined axis. We show that this same basic organization persists throughout mitosis, without helical coiling. Third, from prophase onward, chromosomes are deformed into sequential arrays of half-helical segments of alternating handedness (perversions), accompanied by correlated kinks. These arrays fluctuate dynamically over <15 s timescales. Together these discoveries redefine the foundation for thinking about the evolution of mitotic chromosomes as they prepare for anaphase segregation."	0
"31968243"	"Striatal Projection Neurons Require Huntingtin for Synaptic Connectivity and Survival.Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an autosomal dominant polyglutamine expansion mutation of Huntingtin (HTT). HD patients suffer from progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments, along with significant degeneration of the striatal projection neurons (SPNs) of the striatum. HD is widely accepted to be caused by a toxic gain-of-function of mutant HTT. However, whether loss of HTT function, because of dominant-negative effects of the mutant protein, plays a role in HD and whether HTT is required for SPN health and function are not known. Here, we delete Htt from specific subpopulations of SPNs using the Cre-Lox system and find that SPNs require HTT for motor regulation, synaptic development, cell health, and survival during aging. Our results suggest that loss of HTT function in SPNs could play a critical role in HD pathogenesis."	0
"32532821"	"The RNA-associated proteins MKT1 and MKT1L form alternative PBP1-containing complexes in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>.Control of gene expression in kinetoplastids such as trypanosomes depends heavily on RNA-binding proteins that influence mRNA decay and translation. We previously showed that the trypanosome protein MKT1 forms a multicomponent protein complex: MKT1 interacts with PBP1, which in turn recruits LSM12 and poly(A)-binding protein. MKT1 is recruited to mRNAs by sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in stabilization of the bound mRNA. We here show that PBP1, LSM12, and a 117-residue protein, XAC1 (Tb927.7.2780), are present in complexes that contain either MKT1 or an MKT1-like protein, MKT1L (Tb927.10.1490). All five proteins are present predominantly in the complexes, and we found evidence for a minor subset of complexes containing both MKT1 and MKT1L. XAC1-containing complexes reproducibly contained RNA-binding proteins that were previously found associated with MKT1. Moreover, XAC1- or MKT1-containing complexes specifically recruited one of the two poly(A)-binding proteins, PABP2, and one of the six cap-binding translation initiation complexes, EIF4E6-EIF4G5. Yeast two-hybrid assay results indicated that MKT1 directly interacts with EIF4G5. MKT1-PBP1 complexes can therefore interact with mRNAs via their poly(A) tails and caps, as well as through sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. Correspondingly, MKT1 is associated with many mRNAs, although not with those encoding ribosomal proteins. Meanwhile, MKT1L resembles MKT1 at the C terminus but additionally features an N-terminal extension with low-complexity regions. Although MKT1L depletion inhibited cell proliferation, we found no evidence that it specifically interacts with RNA-binding proteins or mRNA. We speculate that MKT1L may compete with MKT1 for PBP1 binding and thereby modulate the function of MKT1-containing complexes."	0
"32492429"	"Inactivation of Rho GTPases by Burkholderia cenocepacia Induces a WASH-Mediated Actin Polymerization that Delays Phagosome Maturation.Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes severe pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease patients. B. cenocepacia can survive inside infected macrophages within the B. cenocepacia-containing vacuole (BcCV) and to elicit a severe inflammatory response. By inactivating the host macrophage Rho GTPases, the bacterial effector TecA causes depolymerization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we find that B. cenocepacia induces the formation of large cytosolic F-actin clusters in infected macrophages. Cluster formation requires the nucleation-promoting factor WASH, the Arp2/3 complex, and TecA. Inactivation of Rho GTPases by bacterial toxins is necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of the cytosolic actin clusters. By hijacking WASH and Arp2/3 activity, B. cenocepacia disrupts interactions with the endolysosomal system, thereby delaying the maturation of the BcCV."	0
"32213324"	"Ultrastructural Details of Mammalian Chromosome Architecture.Over the past decade, 3C-related methods have provided remarkable insights into chromosome folding in vivo. To overcome the limited resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed Hi-C variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human ESCs and fibroblasts. Micro-C robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable resource for studies of chromosome organization."	0
"32571875"	"PRL3 pseudophosphatase activity is necessary and sufficient to promote metastatic growth.Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are markers of cancer and promote tumor growth. They have been implicated in a variety of biochemical pathways but the physiologically relevant target of phosphatase activity has eluded 20 years of investigation. Here, we show that PRL3 catalytic activity is not required in a mouse model of metastasis. PRL3 binds and inhibits CNNM4, a membrane protein associated with magnesium transport. Analysis of PRL3 mutants specifically defective in either CNNM-binding or phosphatase activity demonstrate that CNNM binding is necessary and sufficient to promote tumor metastasis. As PRLs do have phosphatase activity, they are in fact <i>pseudo</i>-pseudophosphatases. Phosphatase activity leads to formation of phosphocysteine, which blocks CNNM binding and may play a regulatory role. We show levels of PRL cysteine phosphorylation vary in response to culture conditions and in different tissues. Examination of related protein phosphatases shows the stability of phosphocysteine is a unique and evolutionarily conserved property of PRLs. The demonstration that PRL3 functions as a pseudophosphatase has important ramifications for the design of PRL inhibitors for cancer."	1

Here, we uncover a list of hyperacetylated proteins in the context of acutely reduced Acetyl-CoA levels under nutrient starvation. PHF5A, a component of U2 snRNPs, can be acetylated at lysine 29 in response to multiple cellular stresses, which is dependent on p300. PHF5A acetylation strengthens the interaction among U2 snRNPs and affects global pre-mRNA splicing pattern and extensive gene expression. PHF5A hyperacetylation-induced alternative splicing stabilizes KDM3A mRNA and promotes its protein expression. Pathologically, PHF5A K29 hyperacetylation and KDM3A upregulation axis are correlated with poor prognosis of colon cancer. Our findings uncover a mechanism of an anti-stress pathway through which acetylation on PHF5A promotes the cancer cells' capacity for stress resistance and consequently contributes to colon carcinogenesis."	1
"32755570"	"The MARCH6-SQLE Axis Controls Endothelial Cholesterol Homeostasis and Angiogenic Sprouting.The endothelial monolayer forms a barrier between the lumen of blood vessels and the underlying tissues. Stable VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions are essential for maintaining this barrier, whereas their remodeling is required for angiogenesis in health and disease. Here, we position the ERAD-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a determinant of angiogenic sprouting and barrier integrity through its ability to promote the degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Accordingly, MARCHF6 ablation in endothelial cells increases SQLE protein and cholesterol load. This leads to altered membrane order, disorganized adherens junctions, decreased endothelial barrier function, and impaired SQLE-dependent sprouting angiogenesis. Akin to MARCHF6 silencing, the overexpression of SQLE impairs angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is also attenuated when SQLE is silenced, indicating that fine-tuning cholesterol biosynthesis is a determinant of healthy endothelial function. In summary, we propose a mechanistic link between regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by the MARCH6-SQLE axis and endothelial integrity and angiogenesis."	1
"32492432"	"The Number of Transcription Factors at an Enhancer Determines Switch-like Gene Expression.NF-κB is a transcription factor that activates super enhancers (SEs) and typical enhancers (TEs) and triggers threshold and graded gene expression, respectively. However, the mechanisms by which NF-κB selectively participates in these enhancers remain unclear. Here we show using mouse primary B lymphocytes that SE activity simultaneously associates with chromatin opening and enriched NF-κB binding, resulting in a higher fold change and threshold expression upon B cell receptor (BCR) activation. The higher fold change results from longer DNA, whereas the threshold response is explained by synergy in DNA-NF-κB binding and is supported by the coexistence of PU.1 and NF-κB in a SE before cell stimulation. This model indicates that the pre-existing NF-κB functions as a seed and triggers its processive binding upon BCR activation. Our mathematical modeling of the single-cell transcriptome reveals an additional role for SEs in divergent clonal responses in B cells."	0
"32017897"	"Structure-Mediated RNA Decay by UPF1 and G3BP1.Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the stability and, hence, expression of coding and noncoding RNAs. Sequence-specific features within the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) often direct mRNAs for decay. Here, we characterize a genome-wide RNA decay pathway that reduces the half-lives of mRNAs based on overall 3' UTR structure formed by base pairing. The decay pathway is independent of specific single-stranded sequences, as regulation is maintained in both the original and reverse complement orientation. Regulation can be compromised by reducing the overall structure by fusing the 3' UTR with an unstructured sequence. Mutating base-paired RNA regions can also compromise this structure-mediated regulation, which can be restored by re-introducing base-paired structures of different sequences. The decay pathway requires the RNA-binding protein UPF1 and its associated protein G3BP1. Depletion of either protein increased steady-state levels of mRNAs with highly structured 3' UTRs as well as highly structured circular RNAs. This structure-dependent mechanism therefore enables cells to selectively regulate coding and noncoding RNAs."	0
"32348752"	"The Mitochondrial Import Complex MIM Functions as Main Translocase for α-Helical Outer Membrane Proteins.The mitochondrial outer membrane contains integral proteins with α-helical membrane anchors or a transmembrane β-barrel. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) cooperates with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) in the import of β-barrel proteins, whereas the mitochondrial import (MIM) complex inserts precursors of multi-spanning α-helical proteins. Single-spanning proteins constitute more than half of the integral outer membrane proteins; however, their biogenesis is poorly understood. We report that the yeast MIM complex promotes the insertion of proteins with N-terminal (signal-anchored) or C-terminal (tail-anchored) membrane anchors. The MIM complex exists in three dynamic populations. MIM interacts with TOM to accept precursor proteins from the receptor Tom70. Free MIM complexes insert single-spanning proteins that are imported in a Tom70-independent manner. Finally, coupling of MIM and SAM promotes early assembly steps of TOM subunits. We conclude that the MIM complex is a major and versatile protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane."	0
"32846132"	"Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Orchestrates a Coordinated Physiological Response to Fuel Non-shivering Thermogenesis.Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone controlling blood volume and pressure in mammals. It is still unclear whether ANP controls cold-induced thermogenesis in vivo. Here, we show that acute cold exposure induces cardiac ANP secretion in mice and humans. Genetic inactivation of ANP promotes cold intolerance and suppresses half of cold-induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation in mice. While white adipocytes are resistant to ANP-mediated lipolysis at thermoneutral temperature in mice, cold exposure renders white adipocytes fully responsive to ANP to activate lipolysis and a thermogenic program, a physiological response that is dramatically suppressed in ANP null mice. ANP deficiency also blunts liver triglycerides and glycogen metabolism, thus impairing fuel availability for BAT thermogenesis. ANP directly increases mitochondrial uncoupling and thermogenic gene expression in human white and brown adipocytes. Together, these results indicate that ANP is a major physiological trigger of BAT thermogenesis upon cold exposure in mammals."	0

We identify large, mono-allelic genomic deletions and loss-of-heterozygosity escaping standard quality controls in up to 40% of edited clones. To reliably detect such events, we describe simple, low-cost, and broadly applicable quantitative genotyping PCR (qgPCR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping-based tools and suggest their usage as additional quality controls after editing. This will help to ensure the integrity of edited loci and increase the reliability of CRISPR editing."	0

However, it is incompletely understood how luminal signals are integrated to control the development of L cells. Here we show that food availability and gut microbiota-produced short-chain fatty acids control the posttranslational modification on intracellular proteins by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in intestinal epithelial cells. Via FOXO1 O-GlcNAcylation, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) suppresses expression of the lineage-specifying transcription factor Neurogenin 3 and, thus, L cell differentiation from enteroendocrine progenitors. Intestinal epithelial ablation of OGT in mice not only causes L cell hyperplasia and increased secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but also disrupts gut microbial compositions, which notably contributes to decreased weight gain and improved glycemic control. Our results identify intestinal epithelial O-GlcNAc signaling as a brake on L cell development and function in response to nutritional and microbial cues."	0
"32541879"	"Neural metabolic imbalance induced by MOF dysfunction triggers pericyte activation and breakdown of vasculature.Mutations in chromatin-modifying complexes and metabolic enzymes commonly underlie complex human developmental syndromes affecting multiple organs. A major challenge is to determine how disease-causing genetic lesions cause deregulation of homeostasis in unique cell types. Here we show that neural-specific depletion of three members of the non-specific lethal (NSL) chromatin complex-Mof, Kansl2 or Kansl3-unexpectedly leads to severe vascular defects and brain haemorrhaging. Deregulation of the epigenetic landscape induced by the loss of the NSL complex in neural cells causes widespread metabolic defects, including an accumulation of free long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Free LCFAs induce a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory signalling cascade in neighbouring vascular pericytes that is rescued by TLR4 inhibition. Pericytes display functional changes in response to LCFA-induced activation that result in vascular breakdown. Our work establishes that neurovascular function is determined by the neural metabolic environment."	0

The optic tectum and pretectum, two primary visual areas in zebrafish, are involved in motion processing, and yet their differential neural representation of behaviorally relevant visual features is unclear. Here, we characterize receptive fields (RFs) of motion-sensitive neurons in the diencephalon and midbrain. We show that RFs of many pretectal neurons are large and sample the lower visual field, whereas RFs of tectal neurons are mostly small-size selective and sample the upper nasal visual field more densely. Furthermore, optomotor swimming can reliably be evoked by presenting forward motion in the lower temporal visual field alone, matching the lower visual field bias of the pretectum. Thus, tectum and pretectum extract different visual features from distinct regions of visual space, which is likely a result of their adaptations to hunting and optomotor behavior, respectively."	0
"32341548"	"Pac1/LIS1 stabilizes an uninhibited conformation of dynein to coordinate its localization and activity.Dynein is a microtubule motor that transports many different cargos in various cell types and contexts. How dynein is regulated to perform these activities with spatial and temporal precision remains unclear. Human dynein is regulated by autoinhibition, whereby intermolecular contacts limit motor activity. Whether this mechanism is conserved throughout evolution, whether it can be affected by extrinsic factors, and its role in regulating dynein function remain unclear. Here, we use a combination of negative stain electron microscopy, single-molecule assays, genetic, and cell biological techniques to show that autoinhibition is conserved in budding yeast, and plays a key role in coordinating in vivo dynein function. Moreover, we find that the Lissencephaly-related protein, LIS1 (Pac1 in yeast), plays an important role in regulating dynein autoinhibition. Our studies demonstrate that, rather than inhibiting dynein motility, Pac1/LIS1 promotes dynein activity by stabilizing the uninhibited conformation, which ensures appropriate dynein localization and activity in cells."	0

Here, we show that disordered residues 326-380 of p62 directly interact with the C-terminal region (CTR) of FIP200. Crystal structure determination shows that the FIP200 CTR contains a dimeric globular domain that we designated the ""Claw"" for its shape. The interaction of p62 with FIP200 is mediated by a positively charged pocket in the Claw, enhanced by p62 phosphorylation, mutually exclusive with the binding of p62 to LC3B, and it promotes degradation of ubiquitinated cargo by autophagy. Furthermore, the recruitment of the FIP200 CTR slows the phase separation of ubiquitinated proteins by p62 in a reconstituted system. Our data provide the molecular basis for a crosstalk between cargo condensation and autophagosome formation."	1

TNBC has a high frequency of tumor protein p53 (Tp53/p53)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiencies, and combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency is associated with poor prognosis and poor response to anticancer therapies. In this study, we discovered that combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency in TNBC activates expression of the transcription factor mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1). We found that MEOX1 is expressed only in TNBC cells with frequent deficiencies in p53 and PTEN, and that its expression is undetectable in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2+ subtypes, as well as in normal breast cells with wild-type (WT) p53 and PTEN. Notably, siRNA knockdown of both p53 and PTEN activated MEOX1 expression in breast cancer cells, whereas individual knockdowns of either p53 or PTEN had only minimal effects on MEOX1 expression. MEOX1 knockdown abolished cell proliferation of p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC <i>in vitro</i> and inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>, but had no effect on the proliferation of luminal and HER2+ cancer cells and normal breast cells. RNA-Seq and immunoblotting analyses showed that MEOX1 knockdown decreased expression of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B), and STAT6 in p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC cells. These results reveal the effects of combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency on MEOX1 expression and TNBC cell proliferation, suggesting that MEOX1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC."	0

Passage of Crohn's disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) through a murine model, in which intestinal PA levels are increased to mimic the human intestine, leads to the recovery of AIEC with significantly increased virulence. Similar phenotypic changes are observed outside the murine model when AIEC is grown in culture with PA as the sole carbon source; such PA exposure also results in AIEC that persists at 20-fold higher levels in vivo. RNA sequencing identifies an upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress response, metabolism, membrane integrity, and alternative carbon source utilization. PA exposure also increases virulence in a number of E. coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients. Removal of PA is sufficient to reverse these phenotypic changes. Our data indicate that exposure to PA results in AIEC resistance and increased virulence in its presence."	0

Two versions of the complex carrying STAG1 or STAG2 coexist in somatic vertebrate cells. STAG2 is commonly mutated in cancer, and germline mutations have been identified in cohesinopathy patients. To better understand the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, we report the consequences of Stag2 ablation in mice. STAG2 is largely dispensable in adults, and its tissue-wide inactivation does not lead to tumors but reduces fitness and affects both hematopoiesis and intestinal homeostasis. STAG2 is also dispensable for murine embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. In contrast, Stag2-null embryos die by mid-gestation and show global developmental delay and defective heart morphogenesis, most prominently in structures derived from secondary heart field progenitors.

"32719012"	"A cytoskeletal protein complex is essential for division of intracellular amastigotes of <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>.Previous studies in <i>Leishmania mexicana</i> have identified the cytoskeletal protein KHARON as being important for both flagellar trafficking of the glucose transporter GT1 and for successful cytokinesis and survival of infectious amastigote forms inside mammalian macrophages. KHARON is located in three distinct regions of the cytoskeleton: the base of the flagellum, the subpellicular microtubules, and the mitotic spindle. To deconvolve the different functions for KHARON, we have identified two partner proteins, KHAP1 and KHAP2, which associate with KHARON. KHAP1 is located only in the subpellicular microtubules, whereas KHAP2 is located at the subpellicular microtubules and the base of the flagellum. Both <i>KHAP1</i> and <i>KHAP2</i> null mutants are unable to execute cytokinesis but are able to traffic GT1 to the flagellum.

Here, we explore how human genetic variation affects exon recognition by developing a multiplexed functional assay of splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS). We assayed 27,733 variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) within or adjacent to 2,198 human exons in the MFASS minigene reporter and found that 3.8% (1,050) of variants, most of which are extremely rare, led to large-effect splice-disrupting variants (SDVs). Importantly, we find that 83% of SDVs are located outside of canonical splice sites, are distributed evenly across distinct exonic and intronic regions, and are difficult to predict a priori. Our results indicate extant, rare genetic variants can have large functional effects on splicing at appreciable rates, even outside the context of disease, and MFASS enables their empirical assessment at scale."	0
"32559423"	"Targeting Metabolism to Improve the Tumor Microenvironment for Cancer Immunotherapy.The growing field of immune metabolism has revealed promising indications for metabolic targets to modulate anti-cancer immunity. Combination therapies involving metabolic inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), chemotherapy, radiation, and/or diet now offer new approaches for cancer therapy. However, it remains uncertain how to best utilize these strategies in the context of the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Oncogene-driven changes in tumor cell metabolism can impact the TME to limit immune responses and present barriers to cancer therapy. These changes also reveal opportunities to reshape the TME by targeting metabolic pathways to favor immunity. Here we explore current strategies that shift immune cell metabolism to pro-inflammatory states in the TME and highlight a need to better replicate physiologic conditions to select targets, clarify mechanisms, and optimize metabolic inhibitors. Unifying our understanding of these pathways and interactions within the heterogenous TME will be instrumental to advance this promising field and enhance immunotherapy."	0
"32381510"	"Age-related changes in the physical properties, cross-linking, and glycation of collagen from mouse tail tendon.Collagen is a structural protein whose internal cross-linking critically determines the properties and functions of connective tissue. Knowing how the cross-linking of collagen changes with age is key to understanding why the mechanical properties of tissues change over a lifetime. The current scientific consensus is that collagen cross-linking increases with age and that this increase leads to tendon stiffening. Here, we show that this view should be reconsidered. Using MS-based analyses, we demonstrated that during aging of healthy C57BL/6 mice, the overall levels of collagen cross-linking in tail tendon decreased with age. However, the levels of lysine glycation in collagen, which is not considered a cross-link, increased dramatically with age. We found that in 16-week-old diabetic db/db mice, glycation reaches levels similar to those observed in 98-week-old C57BL/6 mice, while the other cross-links typical of tendon collagen either decreased or remained the same as those observed in 20-week-old WT mice. These results, combined with findings from mechanical testing of tendons from these mice, indicate that overall collagen cross-linking in mouse tendon decreases with age. Our findings also reveal that lysine glycation appears to be an important factor that contributes to tendon stiffening with age and in diabetes."	0
"31901446"	"Su(var)2-10 and the SUMO Pathway Link piRNA-Guided Target Recognition to Chromatin Silencing.Regulation of transcription is the main mechanism responsible for precise control of gene expression. Whereas the majority of transcriptional regulation is mediated by DNA-binding transcription factors that bind to regulatory gene regions, an elegant alternative strategy employs small RNA guides, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to identify targets of transcriptional repression. Here, we show that in Drosophila the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO and the SUMO E3 ligase Su(var)2-10 are required for piRNA-guided deposition of repressive chromatin marks and transcriptional silencing of piRNA targets. Su(var)2-10 links the piRNA-guided target recognition complex to the silencing effector by binding the piRNA/Piwi complex and inducing SUMO-dependent recruitment of the SetDB1/Wde histone methyltransferase effector. We propose that in Drosophila, the nuclear piRNA pathway has co-opted a conserved mechanism of SUMO-dependent recruitment of the SetDB1/Wde chromatin modifier to confer repression of genomic parasites."	1
"32554467"	"The RAS-interacting chaperone UNC119 drives the RASSF6-MDM2-p53 axis and antagonizes RAS-mediated malignant transformation.The gene encoding the proto-oncogene GTPase RAS is frequently mutated in human cancers. Mutated RAS proteins trigger antiapoptotic and cell-proliferative signals and lead to oncogenesis. However, RAS also induces apoptosis and senescence, which may contribute to the eradication of cells with RAS mutations. We previously reported that Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6) binds MDM2 and stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and that the active form of KRAS promotes the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2. We also reported that Unc-119 lipid-binding chaperone (UNC119A), a chaperone of myristoylated proteins, interacts with RASSF6 and regulates RASSF6-mediated apoptosis. In this study, using several human cancer cell lines, quantitative RT-PCR, RNAi-based gene silencing, and immunoprecipitation/-fluorescence and cell biology assays, we report that UNC119A interacts with the active form of KRAS and that the C-terminal modification of KRAS is required for this interaction. We also noted that the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119A, which binds the myristoylated peptides, is not involved in the interaction. We observed that UNC119A promotes the binding of KRAS to RASSF6, enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2, and induces apoptosis. Conversely, <i>UNC119A</i> silencing promoted soft-agar colony formation, migration, and invasiveness in KRAS-mutated cancer cells. We conclude that UNC119A promotes KRAS-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis via RASSF6 and may play a tumor-suppressive role in cells with KRAS mutations."	1
"30606466"	"Phage AcrIIA2 DNA Mimicry: Structural Basis of the CRISPR and Anti-CRISPR Arms Race.CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) systems provide prokaryotic cells with adaptive immunity against invading bacteriophages. Bacteriophages counteract bacterial responses by encoding anti-CRISPR inhibitor proteins (Acr). However, the structural basis for their inhibitory actions remains largely unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of the AcrIIA2-SpyCas9-sgRNA (single-guide RNA) complex at 3.3 Å resolution. We show that AcrIIA2 binds SpyCas9 at a position similar to the target DNA binding region. More specifically, AcrIIA2 interacts with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition residues of Cas9, preventing target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) detection. Thus, phage-encoded AcrIIA2 appears to act as a DNA mimic that blocks subsequent dsDNA binding by virtue of its highly acidic residues, disabling bacterial Cas9 by competing with target dsDNA binding with a binding motif distinct from AcrIIA4. Our study provides a more detailed mechanistic understanding of AcrIIA2-mediated inhibition of SpyCas9, the most widely used genome-editing tool, opening new avenues for improved regulatory precision during genome editing."	0
"31398324"	"Reaction Mechanisms of Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 Drive RNA Channeling in the siRNA-Directed DNA Methylation Pathway.In eukaryotes with multiple small RNA pathways, the mechanisms that channel RNAs within specific pathways are unclear. Here, we reveal the reactions that account for channeling in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis phase of the Arabidopsis RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. The process begins with template DNA transcription by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV), whose atypical termination mechanism, induced by nontemplate DNA base-pairing, channels transcripts to the associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2. RDR2 converts Pol IV transcripts into double-stranded RNAs and then typically adds an extra untemplated 3' terminal nucleotide to the second strands. The dicer endonuclease DCL3 cuts resulting duplexes to generate 24- and 23-nt siRNAs. The 23-nt RNAs bear the untemplated terminal nucleotide of the RDR2 strand and are underrepresented among ARGONAUTE4-associated siRNAs. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into Pol IV termination, Pol IV-RDR2 coupling, and RNA channeling, from template DNA transcription to siRNA strand discrimination."	0
"32234470"	"NONU-1 Encodes a Conserved Endonuclease Required for mRNA Translation Surveillance.Cellular translation surveillance rescues ribosomes that stall on problematic mRNAs. During translation surveillance, endonucleolytic cleavage of the problematic mRNA is a critical step in rescuing stalled ribosomes. Here we identify NONU-1 as a factor required for translation surveillance pathways including no-go and nonstop mRNA decay. We show that (1) NONU-1 reduces nonstop and no-go mRNA levels; (2) NONU-1 contains an Smr RNase domain required for mRNA decay; (3) the domain architecture and catalytic residues of NONU-1 are conserved throughout metazoans and eukaryotes, respectively; and (4) NONU-1 is required for the formation of mRNA cleavage fragments in the vicinity of stalled ribosomes. We extend our results in C. elegans to homologous factors in S. cerevisiae, showing the evolutionarily conserved function of NONU-1. Our work establishes the identity of a factor critical to translation surveillance and will inform mechanistic studies at the intersection of translation and mRNA decay."	0

The serine threonine kinase Akt plays a pivotal role in the control of cellular metabolism, survival, and mitogenic signaling. Herein, Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates in the mammary gland is reduced by cyclin D1 genetic deletion and is induced by mammary-gland-targeted cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 is associated with Akt1 and augments the rate of onset and maximal cellular Akt1 activity induced by mitogens. Cyclin D1 is identified in a cytoplasmic-membrane-associated pool, and cytoplasmic-membrane-localized cyclin D1-but not nuclear-localized cyclin D1-recapitulates Akt1 transcriptional function. These studies identify a novel extranuclear function of cyclin D1 to enhance proliferative functions via augmenting Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473."	1

Progress in answering this and other questions in AD research has been limited by an inability to model human-specific phenotypes in an in vivo environment. Here we transplant human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons carrying normal apoE3 or pathogenic apoE4 into human apoE3 or apoE4 knockin mouse hippocampi, enabling us to disentangle the effects of apoE4 produced in human neurons and in the brain environment. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we identify key transcriptional changes specific to human neuron subtypes in response to endogenous or exogenous apoE4. We also find that Aβ from transplanted human neurons forms plaque-like aggregates, with differences in localization and interaction with microglia depending on the transplant and host apoE genotype. These findings highlight the power of in vivo chimeric disease modeling for studying AD."	0
"31204167"	"Condensin-Mediated Chromosome Folding and Internal Telomeres Drive Dicentric Severing by Cytokinesis.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dicentric chromosomes stemming from telomere fusions preferentially break at the fusion. This process restores a normal karyotype and protects chromosomes from the detrimental consequences of accidental fusions. Here, we address the molecular basis of this rescue pathway. We observe that tandem arrays tightly bound by the telomere factor Rap1 or a heterologous high-affinity DNA binding factor are sufficient to establish breakage hotspots, mimicking telomere fusions within dicentrics. We also show that condensins generate forces sufficient to rapidly refold dicentrics prior to breakage by cytokinesis and are essential to the preferential breakage at telomere fusions. Thus, the rescue of fused telomeres results from a condensin- and Rap1-driven chromosome folding that favors fusion entrapment where abscission takes place. Because a close spacing between the DNA-bound Rap1 molecules is essential to this process, Rap1 may act by stalling condensins."	0

In this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Cho and colleagues (pp. 53-71) advance in this direction, demonstrating that attenuation of CDK7 fosters the oncogenic activity of the YAP/TAZ/Yki coactivators. CDK7 directly phosphorylates YAP/TAZ/Yki in the nucleus, protecting them from ubiquitination and degradation, in a manner independent from the Hippo cascade and independent from CDK7 basal transcriptional functions."	0
"32402274"	"Protein Kinase A Catalytic Subunit Is a Molecular Switch that Promotes the Pro-tumoral Function of Macrophages.As current therapies benefit only a minority of cancer patients, additional therapeutic targets are needed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have attracted attention for improving therapeutic responses, yet regulatory strategies remain elusive. Here, we show that the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) acts as a molecular switch, inducing a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. In human and murine breast cancer, overactivated PKA in TAMs creates a detrimental microenvironment for cancer progression by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and macrophage-derived arginase 1 (ARG1) expression. Macrophages with genetic deletion of PKA-C are prone to be pro-inflammatory, suggesting a possible immunotherapeutic target. Delivery of liposomal PKA inhibitor facilitates tumor regression and abrogates pro-tumoral TAM functions in mice. The therapeutic effect of targeting PKA is pronounced when combined with αCTLA-4 antibody, increasing cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)<sup>+</sup>GranzymeB<sup>+</sup> T cells by about 60-fold. Our findings demonstrate critical roles of TAM PKA-C in tumor progression and suggest that targeting PKA-C efficiently augments cancer treatment responses."	0
"32433963"	"Zinc Finger RNA-Binding Protein Zn72D Regulates ADAR-Mediated RNA Editing in Neurons.Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, alters RNA sequences from those encoded by DNA. These editing events are dynamically regulated, but few trans regulators of ADARs are known in vivo. Here, we screen RNA-binding proteins for roles in editing regulation with knockdown experiments in the Drosophila brain. We identify zinc-finger protein at 72D (Zn72D) as a regulator of editing levels at a majority of editing sites in the brain. Zn72D both regulates ADAR protein levels and interacts with ADAR in an RNA-dependent fashion, and similar to ADAR, Zn72D is necessary to maintain proper neuromuscular junction architecture and fly mobility. Furthermore, Zn72D's regulatory role in RNA editing is conserved because the mammalian homolog of Zn72D, Zfr, regulates editing in mouse primary neurons. The broad and conserved regulation of ADAR editing by Zn72D in neurons sustains critically important editing events."	0
"32049026"	"Loss of IQSEC3 Disrupts GABAergic Synapse Maintenance and Decreases Somatostatin Expression in the Hippocampus.Gephyrin interacts with various GABAergic synaptic proteins to organize GABAergic synapse development. Among the multitude of gephyrin-binding proteins is IQSEC3, a recently identified component at GABAergic synapses that acts through its ADP ribosylation factor-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ARF-GEF) activity to orchestrate GABAergic synapse formation. Here, we show that IQSEC3 knockdown (KD) reduced GABAergic synaptic density in vivo, suggesting that IQSEC3 is required for GABAergic synapse maintenance in vivo. We further show that IQSEC3 KD in the dentate gyrus (DG) increases seizure susceptibility and triggers selective depletion of somatostatin (SST) peptides in the DG hilus in an ARF-GEP activity-dependent manner. Strikingly, selective introduction of SST into SST interneurons in DG-specific IQSEC3-KD mice reverses GABAergic synaptic deficits. Thus, our data suggest that IQSEC3 is required for linking gephyrin-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes with ARF-dependent pathways to prevent aberrant, runaway excitation and thereby contributes to the integrity of SST interneurons and proper GABAergic synapse maintenance."	0
"31735641"	"Cancer-Derived Succinate Promotes Macrophage Polarization and Cancer Metastasis via Succinate Receptor.Macrophages form a major cell population in the tumor microenvironment. They can be activated and polarized into tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) by the tumor-derived soluble molecules to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we used comparative metabolomics coupled with biochemical and animal studies to show that cancer cells release succinate into their microenvironment and activate succinate receptor (SUCNR1) signaling to polarize macrophages into TAM. Furthermore, the results from in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that succinate promotes not only cancer cell migration and invasion but also cancer metastasis. These effects are mediated by SUCNR1-triggered PI3K-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) axis. Compared with healthy subjects and tumor-free lung tissues, serum succinate levels and lung cancer SUCNR1 expression were elevated in lung cancer patients, suggesting an important clinical relevance. Collectively, our findings indicate that the secreted tumor-derived succinate belongs to a novel class of cancer progression factors, controlling TAM polarization and promoting tumorigenic signaling."	1
"32640217"	"Extracellular Granzyme A Promotes Colorectal Cancer Development by Enhancing Gut Inflammation.If not properly regulated, the inflammatory immune response can promote carcinogenesis, as evident in colorectal cancer (CRC). Aiming to gain mechanistic insight into the link between inflammation and CRC, we perform transcriptomics analysis of human CRC, identifying a strong correlation between expression of the serine protease granzyme A (GzmA) and inflammation. In a dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) mouse model, deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of extracellular GzmA both attenuate gut inflammation and prevent CRC development, including the initial steps of cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, extracellular GzmA induces NF-κB-dependent IL-6 production in macrophages, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation in cultured CRC cells. Accordingly, colon tissues from DSS/AOM-treated, GzmA-deficient animals present reduced levels of pSTAT3. By identifying GzmA as a proinflammatory protease that promotes CRC development, these findings provide information on mechanisms that link immune cell infiltration to cancer progression and present GzmA as a therapeutic target for CRC."	1
"32115406"	"Critical roles of phosphoinositides and NF2 in Hippo pathway regulation.The Hippo pathway is a master regulator of tissue homeostasis and organ size. NF2 is a well-established tumor suppressor, and loss of NF2 severely compromises Hippo pathway activity. However, the precise mechanism of how NF2 mediates upstream signals to regulate the Hippo pathway is not clear. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, NF2's lipid-binding ability is critical for its function in activating the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress. Mechanistically, osmotic stress induces PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plasma membrane enrichment by activating the PIP5K family, allowing for NF2 plasma membrane recruitment and subsequent downstream Hippo pathway activation. An NF2 mutant deficient in lipid binding is unable to activate the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress, as measured by LATS and YAP phosphorylation. Our findings identify the PIP5K family as novel regulators upstream of Hippo signaling, and uncover the importance of phosphoinositide dynamics, specifically PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, in Hippo pathway regulation."	1
"32203416"	"piRNA-independent function of PIWIL1 as a co-activator for anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome to drive pancreatic cancer metastasis.Piwi proteins are normally restricted in germ cells to suppress transposons through associations with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), but they are also frequently activated in many types of human cancers. A great puzzle is the lack of significant induction of corresponding piRNAs in cancer cells, as we document here in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), which implies that such germline-specific proteins are somehow hijacked to promote tumorigenesis through a different mode of action. Here, we show that in the absence of piRNAs, human PIWIL1 in PDAC functions as an oncoprotein by activating the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 complex, which then targets a critical cell adhesion-related protein, Pinin, to enhance PDAC metastasis. This is in contrast to piRNA-dependent PIWIL1 ubiquitination and removal by APC/C during late spermiogenesis. These findings unveil a piRNA-dependent mechanism to switch PIWIL1 from a substrate in spermatids to a co-activator of APC/C in human cancer cells."	0

We show here that hepatocyte-specific loss of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) disrupts liver metabolic homeostasis and promotes tumour progression. FBP1 is universally silenced in both human and murine liver tumours. Hepatocyte-specific Fbp1 deletion results in steatosis, concomitant with activation and senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Depleting senescent HSCs by 'senolytic' treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence for FBP1 as a metabolic tumour suppressor in liver cancer and establish a critical crosstalk between hepatocyte metabolism and HSC senescence that promotes tumour growth."	0
"32493772"	"Two clusters of surface-exposed amino acid residues enable high-affinity binding of retinal degeneration-3 (RD3) protein to retinal guanylyl cyclase.Retinal degeneration-3 (RD3) protein protects photoreceptors from degeneration by preventing retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) activation via calcium-sensing guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAP), and RD3 truncation causes severe congenital blindness in humans and other animals. The three-dimensional structure of RD3 has recently been established, but the molecular mechanisms of its inhibitory binding to RetGC remain unclear. Here, we report the results of probing 133 surface-exposed residues in RD3 by single substitutions and deletions to identify side chains that are critical for the inhibitory binding of RD3 to RetGC. We tested the effects of these substitutions and deletions <i>in vitro</i> by reconstituting purified RD3 variants with GCAP1-activated human RetGC1. Although the vast majority of the surface-exposed residues tolerated substitutions without loss of RD3's inhibitory activity, substitutions in two distinct narrow clusters located on the opposite sides of the molecule effectively suppressed RD3 binding to the cyclase. The first surface-exposed cluster included residues adjacent to Leu<sup>63</sup> in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2. The second cluster surrounded Arg<sup>101</sup> on a surface of helix 3. Single substitutions in those two clusters drastically, <i>i.e.</i> up to 245-fold, reduced the IC<sub>50</sub> for the cyclase inhibition. Inactivation of the two binding sites completely disabled binding of RD3 to RetGC1 in living HEK293 cells. In contrast, deletion of 49 C-terminal residues did not affect the apparent affinity of RD3 for RetGC. Our findings identify the functional interface on RD3 required for its inhibitory binding to RetGC, a process essential for protecting photoreceptors from degeneration."	0
"32101734"	"Predicting Successful Generation and Inhibition of Seizure-like Afterdischarges and Mapping Their Seizure Networks Using fMRI.To understand the conditions necessary to initiate and terminate seizures, we investigate optogenetically induced hippocampal seizures with LFP, fMRI, and optogenetic inhibition. During afterdischarge induction using optogenetics, LFP recordings show that stimulations with earlier ictal onset times are more likely to result in afterdischarges and are more difficult to curtail with optogenetic inhibition. These results are generalizable across two initiation sites, the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. fMRI shows that afterdischarges initiated from the dorsal or ventral hippocampus exhibit distinct networks. Short-duration seizures initiated in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus are unilateral and bilateral, respectively, while longer-duration afterdischarges recruit broader, bilateral networks. When optogenetic inhibition is ineffective at stopping seizures, the network activity spreads more extensively but largely overlaps with the network activity associated with seizures that could be curtailed. These results provide insights into how seizures can be inhibited, which has implications for targeted seizure interventions."	0

Both pro- and antiregeneration factors are being identified. We previously reported that the Rtca mediated RNA repair/splicing pathway restricts axon regeneration by inhibiting the nonconventional splicing of <i>Xbp1</i> mRNA under cellular stress. However, the downstream effectors remain unknown. Here, through transcriptome profiling, we show that the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) ringmaker/ringer is dramatically increased in Rtca-deficient <i>Drosophila</i> sensory neurons, which is dependent on Xbp1. Ringer is expressed in sensory neurons before and after injury, and is cell-autonomously required for axon regeneration. While loss of ringer abolishes the regeneration enhancement in Rtca mutants, its overexpression is sufficient to promote regeneration both in the peripheral and central nervous system. Ringer maintains microtubule stability/dynamics with the microtubule-associated protein futsch/MAP1B, which is also required for axon regeneration. Furthermore, ringer lies downstream from and is negatively regulated by the microtubule-associated deacetylase HDAC6, which functions as a regeneration inhibitor. Taken together, our findings suggest that ringer acts as a hub for microtubule regulators that relays cellular status information, such as cellular stress, to the integrity of microtubules in order to instruct neuroregeneration."	0

CPF cleaves pre-mRNAs at a specific site and adds a poly(A) tail. The cleavage reaction defines the 3' end of the mature mRNA, and thus the activity of the endonuclease is highly regulated. Here, we show that reconstitution of specific pre-mRNA cleavage with recombinant yeast proteins requires incorporation of the Ysh1 endonuclease into an eight-subunit ""CPF<sub>core</sub>"" complex. Cleavage also requires the accessory cleavage factors IA and IB, which bind substrate pre-mRNAs and CPF, likely facilitating assembly of an active complex. Using X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry, we determine the structure of Ysh1 bound to Mpe1 and the arrangement of subunits within CPF<sub>core</sub>. Together, our data suggest that the active mRNA 3' end processing machinery is a dynamic assembly that is licensed to cleave only when all protein factors come together at the polyadenylation site."	0

Shear stress is known to control gene expression related to the endothelial-mesenchymal transition and endothelial-hematopoietic transition. However, the impact of blood flow on the cellular processes associated with EC extrusion is less well understood. To address this question, we dynamically record EC movements and use 3D quantitative methods to segregate the contributions of various cellular processes to the cellular trajectories in the zebrafish dorsal aorta. We find that ECs spread toward the cell extrusion area following the tissue deformation direction dictated by flow-derived mechanical forces. Cell extrusion increases when blood flow is impaired. Similarly, the mechanosensor polycystic kidney disease 2 (pkd2) limits cell extrusion, suggesting that ECs actively sense mechanical forces in the process. These findings identify pkd2 and flow as critical regulators of EC extrusion and suggest that mechanical forces coordinate this process by maintaining ECs within the endothelium."	0

In this long-term silencing (perpetuated) phase, the PHD proteins are lost from the nucleation region and silencing is likely maintained by the read-write feedbacks associated with H3K27me3. A combination of noncoding SNPs in the nucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 <i>FLC</i> frequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing cold duration.

By the combined analysis of transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilities and the binding of mRNAs to human Pumilio 1 (PUM1), we identify 48 mRNAs that both bind to PUM1 and exhibit PUM1-dependent degradation. Analysis of changes in the abundance of PUM1 and its degradation target mRNAs in RNA-seq data indicate that DNA-damaging agents negatively regulate PUM1-mediated mRNA decay. Cells exposed to cisplatin have reduced PUM1 abundance and increased PCNA and UBE2A mRNAs encoding proteins involved in DNA damage tolerance by translesion synthesis (TLS). Cells overexpressing PUM1 exhibit impaired DNA synthesis and TLS and increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin.

These alterations in pig limb buds are paralleled by changes in the mesenchymal response to Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, which is altered upstream of the reduction and loss of Fgf8 expression in the ectoderm that overlaps the reduced and vestigial digit rudiments of the pig handplate, respectively. Furthermore, genome-wide open chromatin profiling using equivalent developmental stages of mouse and pig limb buds reveals the functional divergence of about one-third of the regulatory genome. This study uncovers widespread alterations in the regulatory landscapes of genes essential for limb development that likely contributed to the morphological diversion of artiodactyl limbs from the pentadactyl archetype of tetrapods."	0
"32504554"	"Tumor Interferon Signaling Is Regulated by a lncRNA INCR1 Transcribed from the PD-L1 Locus.Tumor interferon (IFN) signaling promotes PD-L1 expression to suppress T cell-mediated immunosurveillance. We identify the IFN-stimulated non-coding RNA 1 (INCR1) as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from the PD-L1 locus and show that INCR1 controls IFNγ signaling in multiple tumor types. Silencing INCR1 decreases the expression of PD-L1, JAK2, and several other IFNγ-stimulated genes. INCR1 knockdown sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing, improving CAR T cell therapy. We discover that PD-L1 and JAK2 transcripts are negatively regulated by binding to HNRNPH1, a nuclear ribonucleoprotein. The primary transcript of INCR1 binds HNRNPH1 to block its inhibitory effects on the neighboring genes PD-L1 and JAK2, enabling their expression. These findings introduce a mechanism of tumor IFNγ signaling regulation mediated by the lncRNA INCR1 and suggest a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy."	0
"32234476"	"Cyclopentenone Prostaglandins and Structurally Related Oxidized Lipid Species Instigate and Share Distinct Pro- and Anti-inflammatory Pathways.Oxidized lipids play a critical role in a variety of diseases with two faces: pro- and anti-inflammatory. The molecular mechanisms of this Janus-faced activity remain largely unknown. Here, we have identified that cyclopentenone-containing prostaglandins such as 15d-PGJ2 and structurally related oxidized phospholipid species possess a dual and opposing bioactivity in inflammation, depending on their concentration. Exposure of dendritic cells (DCs)/macrophages to low concentrations of such lipids before Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation instigates an anti-inflammatory response mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation and downstream targets. By contrast, high concentrations of such lipids upon TLR activation of DCs/macrophages result in inflammatory apoptosis characterized by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-8-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β maturation independently of Nrf2 and the classical inflammasome pathway. These results uncover unexpected pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of physiologically relevant lipid species generated by enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation dependent on their concentration, a phenomenon known as hormesis."	0
"31914394"	"Neurochemical Organization of the Drosophila Brain Visualized by Endogenously Tagged Neurotransmitter Receptors.Neurotransmitters often have multiple receptors that induce distinct responses in receiving cells. Expression and localization of neurotransmitter receptors in individual neurons are therefore critical for understanding the operation of neural circuits. Here we describe a comprehensive library of reporter strains in which a convertible T2A-GAL4 cassette is inserted into endogenous neurotransmitter receptor genes of Drosophila. Using this library, we profile the expression of 75 neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Cluster analysis reveals neurochemical segmentation of the brain, distinguishing higher brain centers from the rest. By recombinase-mediated cassette exchange, we convert T2A-GAL4 into split-GFP and Tango to visualize subcellular localization and activation of dopamine receptors in specific cell types. This reveals striking differences in their subcellular localization, which may underlie the distinct cellular responses to dopamine in different behavioral contexts. Our resources thus provide a versatile toolkit for dissecting the cellular organization and function of neurotransmitter systems in the fly brain."	0

Although melanoma cells have been shown to adopt various phenotypic features in vitro, direct in vivo evidence of metastatic cell plasticity remains sparse. Here, we combine lineage tracing in a spontaneous metastatic mouse model of melanoma, advanced imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches to search for pathophysiologically relevant melanoma cellular states. We identify melanoma cells in intravascular niches of various metastatic organs. These cells are quiescent, are negative for characteristic melanoma markers, and acquire endothelial cell features. We replicate the endothelial transdifferentiation (EndT) finding in another mouse model and provide evidence of EndT in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-metastatic biopsies from human lung, brain, and small intestine, thus highlighting the clinical relevance of these findings. The tumor-vasculature pattern described herein may contribute to melanoma dormancy within metastatic organs and represent a putative target for therapies."	0
"32611767"	"Hairpin RNA-induced conformational change of a eukaryotic-specific lysyl-tRNA synthetase extension and role of adjacent anticodon-binding domain.Human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS) is essential for aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> Higher eukaryotic LysRSs possess an N-terminal extension (Nterm) previously shown to facilitate high-affinity tRNA binding and aminoacylation. This eukaryote-specific appended domain also plays a critical role in hLysRS nuclear localization, thus facilitating noncanonical functions of hLysRS. The structure is intrinsically disordered and therefore remains poorly characterized. Findings of previous studies are consistent with the Nterm domain undergoing a conformational transition to an ordered structure upon nucleic acid binding. In this study, we used NMR to investigate how the type of RNA, as well as the presence of the adjacent anticodon-binding domain (ACB), influences the Nterm conformation. To explore the latter, we used sortase A ligation to produce a segmentally labeled tandem-domain protein, Nterm-ACB. In the absence of RNA, Nterm remained disordered regardless of ACB attachment. Both alone and when attached to ACB, Nterm structure remained unaffected by titration with single-stranded RNAs. The central region of the Nterm domain adopted α-helical structure upon titration of Nterm and Nterm-ACB with RNA hairpins containing double-stranded regions. Nterm binding to the RNA hairpins resulted in CD spectral shifts consistent with an induced helical structure. NMR and fluorescence anisotropy revealed that Nterm binding to hairpin RNAs is weak but that the binding affinity increases significantly upon covalent attachment to ACB. We conclude that the ACB domain facilitates induced-fit conformational changes and confers high-affinity RNA hairpin binding, which may be advantageous for functional interactions of LysRS with a variety of different binding partners."	0
"32814051"	"Alternative Enhancer Usage and Targeted Polycomb Marking Hallmark Promoter Choice during T Cell Differentiation.During thymic development and upon peripheral activation, T cells undergo extensive phenotypic and functional changes coordinated by lineage-specific developmental programs. To characterize the regulatory landscape controlling T cell identity, we perform a wide epigenomic and transcriptional analysis of mouse thymocytes and naive CD4 differentiated T helper cells. Our investigations reveal a dynamic putative enhancer landscape, and we could validate many of the enhancers using the high-throughput CapStarr sequencing (CapStarr-seq) approach. We find that genes using multiple promoters display increased enhancer usage, suggesting that apparent ""enhancer redundancy"" might relate to isoform selection. Furthermore, we can show that two Runx3 promoters display long-range interactions with specific enhancers. Finally, our analyses suggest a novel function for the PRC2 complex in the control of alternative promoter usage. Altogether, our study has allowed for the mapping of an exhaustive set of active enhancers and provides new insights into their function and that of PRC2 in controlling promoter choice during T cell differentiation."	0

"32437639"	"ATP Hydrolysis by the SNF2 Domain of Dnmt5 Is Coupled to Both Specific Recognition and Modification of Hemimethylated DNA.C.neoformans Dnmt5 is an unusually specific maintenance-type CpG methyltransferase (DNMT) that mediates long-term epigenome evolution. It harbors a DNMT domain and SNF2 ATPase domain. We find that the SNF2 domain couples substrate specificity to an ATPase step essential for DNA methylation. Coupling occurs independent of nucleosomes. Hemimethylated DNA preferentially stimulates ATPase activity, and mutating Dnmt5's ATP-binding pocket disproportionately reduces ATPase stimulation by hemimethylated versus unmethylated substrates. Engineered DNA substrates that stabilize a reaction intermediate by mimicking a ""flipped-out"" conformation of the target cytosine bypass the SNF2 domain's requirement for hemimethylation. This result implies that ATP hydrolysis by the SNF2 domain is coupled to the DNMT domain conformational changes induced by preferred substrates. These findings establish a new role for a SNF2 ATPase: controlling an adjoined enzymatic domain's substrate recognition and catalysis. We speculate that this coupling contributes to the exquisite specificity of Dnmt5 via mechanisms related to kinetic proofreading."	0
"32439634"	"A central role for canonical PRC1 in shaping the 3D nuclear landscape.Polycomb group (PcG) proteins silence gene expression by chemically and physically modifying chromatin. A subset of PcG target loci are compacted and cluster in the nucleus; a conformation that is thought to contribute to gene silencing. However, how these interactions influence gross nuclear organization and their relationship with transcription remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role of Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Using a combination of imaging and Hi-C analyses, we show that PRC1-mediated long-range interactions are independent of CTCF and can bridge sites at a megabase scale. Impairment of PRC1 enzymatic activity does not directly disrupt these interactions. We demonstrate that PcG targets coalesce in vivo, and that developmentally induced expression of one of the target loci disrupts this spatial arrangement. Finally, we show that transcriptional activation and the loss of PRC1-mediated interactions are separable events. These findings provide important insights into the function of PRC1, while highlighting the complexity of this regulatory system."	0

We use transgenic mice harboring human tau (rTg4510) and amyloid precursor protein (J20) mutations to investigate transcriptional changes associated with the progression of tau and amyloid pathology. rTg4510 mice are characterized by widespread transcriptional differences in the entorhinal cortex with changes paralleling neuropathological burden across multiple brain regions. Differentially expressed transcripts overlap with genes identified in genetic studies of familial and sporadic AD. Systems-level analyses identify discrete co-expression networks associated with the progressive accumulation of tau that are enriched for genes and pathways previously implicated in AD pathology and overlap with co-expression networks identified in human AD cortex. Our data provide further evidence for an immune-response component in the accumulation of tau and reveal molecular pathways associated with the progression of AD neuropathology."	0
"32023454"	"BLM has Contrary Effects on Repeat-Mediated Deletions, based on the Distance of DNA DSBs to a Repeat and Repeat Divergence.Repeat-mediated deletions (RMDs) often involve repetitive elements (e.g., short interspersed elements) with sequence divergence that is separated by several kilobase pairs (kbps). We have examined RMDs induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) under varying conditions of repeat sequence divergence (identical versus 1% and 3% divergent) and DSB/repeat distance (16 bp-28.4 kbp). We find that the BLM helicase promotes RMDs with long DSB/repeat distances (e.g., 28.4 kbp), which is consistent with a role in extensive DSB end resection, because the resection nucleases EXO1 and DNA2 affect RMDs similarly to BLM. In contrast, BLM suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence and intermediate (e.g., 3.3 kbp) DSB/repeat distances, which supports a role in heteroduplex rejection. The role of BLM in heteroduplex rejection is not epistatic with MSH2 and is independent of the annealing factor RAD52. Accordingly, the role of BLM on RMDs is substantially affected by DSB/repeat distance and repeat sequence divergence."	0
"31422875"	"Dynamic Enhancer DNA Methylation as Basis for Transcriptional and Cellular Heterogeneity of ESCs.Variable levels of DNA methylation have been reported at tissue-specific differential methylation regions (DMRs) overlapping enhancers, including super-enhancers (SEs) associated with key cell identity genes, but the mechanisms responsible for this intriguing behavior are not well understood. We used allele-specific reporters at the endogenous Sox2 and Mir290 SEs in embryonic stem cells and found that the allelic DNA methylation state is dynamically switching, resulting in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Dynamic DNA methylation is driven by the balance between DNA methyltransferases and transcription factor binding on one side and co-regulated with the Mediator complex recruitment and H3K27ac level changes at regulatory elements on the other side. DNA methylation at the Sox2 and the Mir290 SEs is independently regulated and has distinct consequences on the cellular differentiation state. Dynamic allele-specific DNA methylation at the two SEs was also seen at different stages in preimplantation embryos, revealing that methylation heterogeneity occurs in vivo."	0
"32160546"	"Transferrin Receptor Is a Specific Ferroptosis Marker.Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death driven by the iron-dependent accumulation of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids. There is no reliable way to selectively stain ferroptotic cells in tissue sections to characterize the extent of ferroptosis in animal models or patient samples. We address this gap by immunizing mice with membranes from lymphoma cells treated with the ferroptosis inducer piperazine erastin and screening ∼4,750 of the resulting monoclonal antibodies generated for their ability to selectively detect cells undergoing ferroptosis. We find that one antibody, 3F3 ferroptotic membrane antibody (3F3-FMA), is effective as a selective ferroptosis-staining reagent. The antigen of 3F3-FMA is identified as the human transferrin receptor 1 protein (TfR1). We validate this finding with several additional anti-TfR1 antibodies and compare them to other potential ferroptosis-detecting reagents. We find that anti-TfR1 and anti-malondialdehyde adduct antibodies are effective at staining ferroptotic tumor cells in multiple cell culture and tissue contexts."	0
"31968263"	"A Comprehensive Map of the Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cell Transcriptional Network Engaged upon Innate Sensing of HIV.Transcriptional programming of the innate immune response is pivotal for host protection. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that link pathogen sensing with innate activation remain poorly understood. During HIV-1 infection, human dendritic cells (DCs) can detect the virus through an innate sensing pathway, leading to antiviral interferon and DC maturation. Here, we develop an iterative experimental and computational approach to map the HIV-1 innate response circuitry in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). By integrating genome-wide chromatin accessibility with expression kinetics, we infer a gene regulatory network that links 542 transcription factors with 21,862 target genes. We observe that an interferon response is required, yet insufficient, to drive MDDC maturation and identify PRDM1 and RARA as essential regulators of the interferon response and MDDC maturation, respectively. Our work provides a resource for interrogation of regulators of HIV replication and innate immunity, highlighting complexity and cooperativity in the regulatory circuit controlling the response to infection."	0

"30928206"	"MYC Recruits SPT5 to RNA Polymerase II to Promote Processive Transcription Elongation.The MYC oncoprotein binds to promoter-proximal regions of virtually all transcribed genes and enhances RNA polymerase II (Pol II) function, but its precise mode of action is poorly understood. Using mass spectrometry of both MYC and Pol II complexes, we show here that MYC controls the assembly of Pol II with a small set of transcription elongation factors that includes SPT5, a subunit of the elongation factor DSIF. MYC directly binds SPT5, recruits SPT5 to promoters, and enables the CDK7-dependent transfer of SPT5 onto Pol II. Consistent with known functions of SPT5, MYC is required for fast and processive transcription elongation. Intriguingly, the high levels of MYC that are expressed in tumors sequester SPT5 into non-functional complexes, thereby decreasing the expression of growth-suppressive genes. Altogether, these results argue that MYC controls the productive assembly of processive Pol II elongation complexes and provide insight into how oncogenic levels of MYC permit uncontrolled cellular growth."	0
"32527724"	"The folding and unfolding behavior of ribonuclease H on the ribosome.The health of a cell depends on accurate translation and proper protein folding, whereas misfolding can lead to aggregation and disease. The first opportunity for a protein to fold occurs during translation, when the ribosome and surrounding environment can affect the nascent chain energy landscape. However, quantifying these environmental effects is challenging because ribosomal proteins and rRNA preclude most spectroscopic measurements of protein energetics. Here, we have applied two gel-based approaches, pulse proteolysis and force-profile analysis, to probe the folding and unfolding pathways of RNase H (RNH) nascent chains stalled on the prokaryotic ribosome <i>in vitro</i> We found that ribosome-stalled RNH has an increased unfolding rate compared with free RNH. Because protein stability is related to the ratio of the unfolding and folding rates, this increase completely accounts for the observed change in protein stability and indicates that the folding rate is unchanged. Using arrest peptide-based force-profile analysis, we assayed the force generated during the folding of RNH on the ribosome. Surprisingly, we found that population of the RNH folding intermediate is required to generate sufficient force to release a stall induced by the SecM stalling sequence and that readthrough of SecM directly correlates with the stability of the RNH folding intermediate. Together, these results imply that the folding pathway of RNH is unchanged on the ribosome. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the ribosome promotes RNH unfolding while the nascent chain is proximal to the ribosome, which may limit the deleterious effects of RNH misfolding and assist in folding fidelity."	0
"32640218"	"Metabolic Modulation of Immunity: A New Concept in Cancer Immunotherapy.Immunotherapy shifted the paradigm of cancer treatment. The clinical approval of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell transfer led to considerable success in several tumor types. However, for a significant number of patients, these therapies have proven ineffective. Growing evidence shows that the metabolic requirements of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly influence the success of immunotherapy. It is well established that the TME influences energy consumption and metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, often inducing them to become tolerogenic and inefficient in cancer cell eradication. Increasing nutrient availability using pharmacological modulators of metabolism or antibodies targeting specific immune receptors are strategies that support energetic rewiring of immune cells and boost their anti-tumor capacity. In this review, we describe the metabolic features of the diverse immune cell types in the context of the TME and discuss how these immunomodulatory strategies could synergize with immunotherapy to circumvent its current limitations."	0

Because Smc1/3 ATPase heads can also interact with each other, cohesin rings have the potential to form a variety of sub-compartments. Using in vivo cysteine cross-linking, we show that when Smc1 and Smc3 ATPases are engaged in the presence of ATP (E heads), cohesin rings generate a ""SMC (S) compartment"" between hinge and E heads and a ""kleisin (K) compartment"" between E heads and their associated kleisin subunit. Upon ATP hydrolysis, cohesin's heads associate in a different mode, in which their signature motifs and their coiled coils are closely juxtaposed (J heads), creating alternative S and K compartments. We show that K compartments of either E or J type can entrap single DNAs, that acetylation of Smc3 during S phase is associated with J heads, and that sister DNAs are entrapped in J-K compartments."	0

We describe the progressive cellular events that orchestrate the formation of individual limb muscle bundles and directly demonstrate the role of the connective tissue cells that surround muscle precursors in controlling these events. We show how disruption of gene activity within or genetic ablation of connective tissue cells impacts muscle precursors causing disruption of muscle bundle formation and subsequent muscle dysplasia and hypoplasia. We identify several markers of the populations of connective tissue cells that surround muscle precursors and provide a model for how matrix-modifying proteoglycans secreted by these cells may influence muscle bundle formation by effects on the local extracellular matrix (ECM) environment."	0

We next examine overlap with 251 brain differentially expressed gene sets from mouse models of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Human-mouse overlaps highlight responses to amyloid versus tau pathology and reveal age- and sex-dependent expression signatures for disease progression. Human coexpression modules enriched for neuronal and/or microglial genes broadly overlap with mouse models of AD, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and aging.

"32139421"	"Loss of an H3K9me anchor rescues laminopathy-linked changes in nuclear organization and muscle function in an Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy model.Mutations in the nuclear structural protein lamin A produce rare, tissue-specific diseases called laminopathies. The introduction of a human Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD)-inducing mutation into the <i>C. elegans</i> lamin (LMN-Y59C), recapitulates many muscular dystrophy phenotypes, and correlates with hyper-sequestration of a heterochromatic array at the nuclear periphery in muscle cells. Using muscle-specific emerin Dam-ID in worms, we monitored the effects of the mutation on endogenous chromatin. An increased contact with the nuclear periphery along chromosome arms, and an enhanced release of chromosomal centers, coincided with the disease phenotypes of reduced locomotion and compromised sarcomere integrity. The coupling of the LMN-Y59C mutation with the ablation of CEC-4, a chromodomain protein that anchors H3K9-methylated chromatin at the nuclear envelope (NE), suppressed the muscle-associated disease phenotypes. Deletion of <i>cec-4</i> also rescued LMN-Y59C-linked alterations in chromatin organization and some changes in transcription. Sequences that changed position in the LMN-Y59C mutant, are enriched for E2F (EFL-2)-binding sites, consistent with previous studies suggesting that altered Rb-E2F interaction with lamin A may contribute to muscle dysfunction. In summary, we were able to counteract the dominant muscle-specific defects provoked by LMNA mutation by the ablation of a lamin-associated H3K9me anchor, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for EDMD."	0

Importantly, specific characteristics of maternal IgGs that herald progression to severe infant dengue are unknown. Here, we define ≥10% afucosylation of maternal anti-dengue IgGs as a risk factor for susceptibility of infants to symptomatic dengue infections. Mechanistic experiments show that afucosylation of anti-dengue IgGs promotes FcγRIIIa signaling during infection, in turn enhancing dengue virus replication in FcγRIIIa<sup>+</sup> monocytes.

However, how to leverage cellular signaling to ablate TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein for PCa treatment remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage induces proteasomal degradation of wild-type ERG and TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein through ERG threonine-187 and tyrosine-190 phosphorylation mediated by GSK3β and WEE1, respectively. The dual phosphorylation triggers ERG recognition and degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7 in a manner independent of a canonical degron. DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG degradation was abolished by cancer-associated PTEN deletion or GSK3β inactivation. Blockade of DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein degradation causes chemotherapy-resistant growth of fusion-positive PCa cells in culture and in mice.

"31302001"	"SENP1-Sirt3 Signaling Controls Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation and Metabolism.Sirt3, as a major mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, is required for mitochondrial metabolic adaption to various stresses. However, how to regulate Sirt3 activity responding to metabolic stress remains largely unknown. Here, we report Sirt3 as a SUMOylated protein in mitochondria. SUMOylation suppresses Sirt3 catalytic activity. SUMOylation-deficient Sirt3 shows elevated deacetylation on mitochondrial proteins and increased fatty acid oxidation. During fasting, SUMO-specific protease SENP1 is accumulated in mitochondria and quickly de-SUMOylates and activates Sirt3. SENP1 deficiency results in hyper-SUMOylation of Sirt3 and hyper-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, which reduces mitochondrial metabolic adaption responding to fasting. Furthermore, we find that fasting induces SENP1 translocation into mitochondria to activate Sirt3. The studies on mice show that Sirt3 SUMOylation mutation reduces fat mass and antagonizes high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity via increasing oxidative phosphorylation and energy expenditure. Our results reveal that SENP1-Sirt3 signaling modulates Sirt3 activation and mitochondrial metabolism during metabolic stress."	0

Although this regimen shortly improves symptoms in the short term, it also leads to more malignant disease in the long term. We describe a multilayered analysis ranging from chromatin to translation-integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and ribosome profiling-to understand how cisplatin confers (pre)malignant features by using a well-established ovarian cancer model of cisplatin exposure. This approach allows us to segregate the human transcriptome into gene modules representing distinct regulatory principles and to characterize that the most cisplatin-disrupted modules are associated with underlying events of super-enhancer plasticity. These events arise when cancer cells initiate without ultimately ending the program of drug-stimulated death. Using a PageRank-based algorithm, we predict super-enhancer regulator ISL1 as a driver of this plasticity and validate this prediction by using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB inhibition (CRISPRi) and CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 activation (CRISPRa) tools. Together, we propose that cisplatin reprograms cancer cells when inducing them to undergo near-to-death experiences."	0

Multiple cis-regulatory elements exist around Ifng along with a non-coding transcript, Ifng-as1 (also termed NeST). Here, we describe two genetic models generated to dissect the molecular functions of this locus and its RNA product. DNA deletion within the Ifng-as1 locus disrupted chromatin organization of the extended Ifng locus, impaired Ifng response, and compromised host defense. Insertion of a polyA signal ablated the Ifng-as1 full-length transcript and impaired host defense, while allowing proper chromatin structure. Transient knockdown of Ifng-as1 also reduced IFN-γ production. In humans, discordant expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 was evident in memory T cells, with high expression of this long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and low expression of the cytokine. These results establish Ifng-as1 as an important regulator of Ifng expression, as a DNA element and transcribed RNA, involved in dynamic and cell state-specific responses to infection."	0

We use a pre-clinical model of otitis media (OM) to determine the potential role for microevolution of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) during sequential episodes of disease. Whole genome sequencing reveals microevolution of hemoglobin binding and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis genes, suggesting that adaptation of these systems is critical for infection. These OM-adapted strains promote increased biofilm formation, inflammation, stromal fibrosis, and an increased propensity to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). Remarkably, IBCs remain for at least one month following clinical resolution of infection, suggesting an intracellular reservoir as a nidus for recurrent OM.

The phylum Actinobacteria, which includes the genera Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and Streptomyces, is of both medical and economic significance. Here, we report that EF-P is required in these bacteria in particular for the translation of proteins involved in amino acid and secondary metabolite production. Notably, EF-P of Actinobacteria species does not need any post-translational modification for activation. While the function and overall 3D structure of this EF-P type is conserved, the loop containing the conserved lysine is flanked by two essential prolines that rigidify it.

RyRs are targeted by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), a controversial regulation implicated in disorders ranging from heart failure to Alzheimer's. Using crystal structures, we show that the phosphorylation hotspot domain of RyR2 embraces the PKA catalytic subunit, with an extensive interface not seen in PKA complexes with peptides. We trapped an intermediary open-form PKA bound to the RyR2 domain and an ATP analog, showing that PKA can engage substrates in an open form. Phosphomimetics or prior phosphorylation at nearby sites in RyR2 either enhance or reduce the activity of PKA. Finally, we show that a phosphomimetic at S2813, a well-known target site for calmodulin-dependent kinase II, induces the formation of an alpha helix in the phosphorylation domain, resulting in increased interactions and PKA activity. This shows that the different phosphorylation sites in RyR2 are not independent."	0

However, the in vivo consequences and therapeutic potential of pharmacologically enhancing NMDAR function via allosteric modulation are largely unknown. We examine the in vivo effects of GNE-0723, a positive allosteric modulator of GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDARs, on brain network and cognitive functions in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). GNE-0723 use dependently potentiates synaptic NMDA receptor currents and reduces brain oscillation power with a predominant effect on low-frequency (12-20 Hz) oscillations. Interestingly, DS and AD mouse models display aberrant low-frequency oscillatory power that is tightly correlated with network hypersynchrony. GNE-0723 treatment reduces aberrant low-frequency oscillations and epileptiform discharges and improves cognitive functions in DS and AD mouse models. GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDAR enhancers may have therapeutic benefits in brain disorders with network hypersynchrony and cognitive impairments."	0
"32348766"	"ADAR1 Facilitates KSHV Lytic Reactivation by Modulating the RLR-Dependent Signaling Pathway.Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that exhibits two alternative life cycles: latency and lytic reactivation. During lytic reactivation, host innate immune responses are activated to restrict viral replication. Here, we report that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is required for optimal KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. Knockdown of ADAR1 in KSHV latently infected cells inhibits viral gene transcription and viral replication during KSHV lytic reactivation. ADAR1 deficiency also significantly increases type I interferon production during KSHV reactivation. This increased interferon response is dependent on activation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. Depletion of ADAR1 together with either RIG-I, MDA5, or MAVS reverses the increased IFNβ production and rescues KSHV lytic replication. These data suggest that ADAR1 serves as a proviral factor for KSHV lytic reactivation and facilitates DNA virus reactivation by dampening the RLR pathway-mediated innate immune response."	0
"32101750"	"Dissecting the Regulatory Strategies of NF-κB RelA Target Genes in the Inflammatory Response Reveals Differential Transactivation Logics.Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) RelA is the potent transcriptional activator of inflammatory response genes. We stringently defined a list of direct RelA target genes by integrating physical (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) and functional (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq] in knockouts) datasets. We then dissected each gene's regulatory strategy by testing RelA variants in a primary-cell genetic-complementation assay. All endogenous target genes require RelA to make DNA-base-specific contacts, and none are activatable by the DNA binding domain alone. However, endogenous target genes differ widely in how they employ the two transactivation domains. Through model-aided analysis of the dynamic time-course data, we reveal the gene-specific synergy and redundancy of TA1 and TA2. Given that post-translational modifications control TA1 activity and intrinsic affinity for coactivators determines TA2 activity, the differential TA logics suggests context-dependent versus context-independent control of endogenous RelA-target genes. Although some inflammatory initiators appear to require co-stimulatory TA1 activation, inflammatory resolvers are a part of the NF-κB RelA core response."	0
"30849395"	"Mitotic CDK Promotes Replisome Disassembly, Fork Breakage, and Complex DNA Rearrangements.DNA replication errors generate complex chromosomal rearrangements and thereby contribute to tumorigenesis and other human diseases. One mechanism that triggers these errors is mitotic entry before the completion of DNA replication. To address how mitosis might affect DNA replication, we used Xenopus egg extracts. When mitotic CDK (Cyclin B1-CDK1) is used to drive interphase egg extracts into a mitotic state, the replicative CMG (CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS) helicase undergoes ubiquitylation on its MCM7 subunit, dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP. Whether replisomes have stalled or undergone termination, CMG ubiquitylation is followed by its extraction from chromatin by the CDC48/p97 ATPase. TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading during mitosis is also seen in C. elegans early embryos. At stalled forks, CMG removal results in fork breakage and end joining events involving deletions and templated insertions. Our results identify a mitotic pathway of global replisome disassembly that can trigger replication fork collapse and DNA rearrangements."	0

However, the molecular links between cilia, IFT proteins, and cardiogenesis are yet to be established. Using a combination of biochemistry, genetics, and live-imaging methods, we show that IFT complex B proteins (Ift88, Ift54, and Ift20) modulate the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in zebrafish and mouse. We demonstrate that this interaction is key to restrict the formation of the proepicardium and the myocardium. In cellulo experiments suggest that IFT88 and IFT20 interact with YAP1 in the cytoplasm and functionally modulate its activity, identifying a molecular link between cilia-related proteins and the Hippo pathway. Taken together, our results highlight a noncanonical role for IFT complex B proteins during cardiogenesis and shed light on a mechanism of action for ciliary proteins in YAP1 regulation."	0
"32518157"	"A unique combination of glycoside hydrolases in <i>Streptococcus suis</i> specifically and sequentially acts on host-derived αGal-epitope glycans.Infections by many bacterial pathogens rely on their ability to degrade host glycans by producing glycoside hydrolases (GHs). Here, we discovered a conserved multifunctional GH, SsGalNagA, containing a unique combination of two family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a GH16 domain and a GH20 domain, in the zoonotic pathogen <i>Streptococcus suis</i> 05ZYH33. Enzymatic assays revealed that the SsCBM-GH16 domain displays <i>endo</i>-(β1,4)-galactosidase activity specifically toward the host-derived αGal epitope Gal(α1,3)Gal(β1,4)Glc(NAc)-R, whereas the SsGH20 domain has a wide spectrum of <i>exo</i>-β-<i>N</i>-acetylhexosaminidase activities, including <i>exo</i>-(β1,3)-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminidase activity, and employs this activity to act in tandem with SsCBM-GH16 on the αGal-epitope glycan. Further, we found that the CBM32 domain adjacent to the SsGH16 domain is indispensable for SsGH16 catalytic activity. Surface plasmon resonance experiments uncovered that both CBM32 domains specifically bind to αGal-epitope glycan, and together they had a <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of 3.5 mm toward a pentasaccharide αGal-epitope glycan. Cell-binding and αGal epitope removal assays revealed that SsGalNagA efficiently binds to both swine erythrocytes and tracheal epithelial cells and removes the αGal epitope from these cells, suggesting that SsGalNagA functions in nutrient acquisition or alters host signaling in <i>S. suis</i> Both binding and removal activities were blocked by an αGal-epitope glycan. SsGalNagA is the first enzyme reported to sequentially act on a glycan containing the αGal epitope. These findings shed detailed light on the evolution of GHs and an important host-pathogen interaction."	0

"32130912"	"Hierarchy in Hfq Chaperon Occupancy of Small RNA Targets Plays a Major Role in Their Regulation.Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression that base pair with complementary sequences on target mRNAs, often in association with the chaperone Hfq. Here, using experimentally identified sRNA-target pairs, along with gene expression measurements, we assess basic principles of regulation by sRNAs. We show that the sRNA sequence dictates the target repertoire, as point mutations in the sRNA shift the target set correspondingly. We distinguish two subsets of targets: targets showing changes in expression levels under overexpression of their sRNA regulator and unaffected targets that interact more sporadically with the sRNA. These differences among targets are associated with their Hfq occupancy, rather than with the sRNA-target base-pairing potential. Our results suggest that competition among targets over Hfq binding plays a major role in the regulatory outcome, possibly awarding targets with higher Hfq binding efficiency an advantage in the competition over binding to the sRNA."	0
"30527666"	"A Transcriptome-wide Translational Program Defined by LIN28B Expression Level.LIN28 RNA binding proteins are dynamically expressed throughout mammalian development and during disease. However, it remains unclear how changes in LIN28 expression define patterns of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here we show that LIN28 expression level is a key variable that sets the magnitude of protein translation. By systematically varying LIN28B protein levels in human cells, we discovered a dose-dependent divergence in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy that enabled the formation of two discrete translational subpopulations composed of nearly all expressed genes. This bifurcation in gene expression was mediated by a redistribution in Argonaute association, from let-7 to non-let-7 microRNA families, resulting in a global shift in cellular miRNA activity. Post-transcriptional effects were scaled across the physiological LIN28 expression range. Together, these data highlight the central importance of RBP expression level and its ability to encode regulation."	0
"32697990"	"Interplay between Extracellular Matrix Stiffness and JAM-A Regulates Mechanical Load on ZO-1 and Tight Junction Assembly.Tight-junction-regulated actomyosin activity determines epithelial and endothelial tension on adherens junctions and drives morphogenetic processes; however, whether or not tight junctions themselves are under tensile stress is not clear. Here, we use a tension sensor based on ZO-1, a scaffolding protein that links the junctional membrane to the cytoskeleton, to determine if tight junctions carry a mechanical load. Our data indicate that ZO-1 is under mechanical tension and that forces acting on ZO-1 are regulated by extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and the junctional adhesion molecule JAM-A. JAM-A depletion stimulates junctional recruitment of p114RhoGEF/ARHGEF18, mechanical tension on ZO-1, and traction forces at focal adhesions. p114RhoGEF is required for activation of junctional actomyosin activity and tight junction integrity on stiff but not soft ECM. Thus, junctional ZO-1 bears a mechanical load, and junction assembly is regulated by interplay between the physical properties of the ECM and adhesion-regulated signaling at tight junctions."	0
"32579919"	"Epigenomically Bistable Regions across Neuron-Specific Genes Govern Neuron Eligibility to a Coding Ensemble in the Hippocampus.Sensory inputs activate sparse neuronal ensembles in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but how eligibility of individual neurons to recruitment is determined remains elusive. We identify thousands of largely bistable (CpG methylated or unmethylated) regions within neuronal gene bodies, established during mouse dentate gyrus development. Reducing DNA methylation and the proportion of the methylated epialleles at bistable regions compromises novel context-induced neuronal activation. Conversely, increasing methylation and the frequency of the methylated epialleles at bistable regions enhances intrinsic excitability. Single-nucleus profiling reveals enrichment of specific epialleles related to a subset of primarily exonic, bistable regions in activated neurons. Genes displaying both differential methylation and expression in activated neurons define a network of proteins regulating neuronal excitability and structural plasticity. We propose a model in which bistable regions create neuron heterogeneity and constellations of exonic methylation, which may contribute to cell-specific gene expression, excitability, and eligibility to a coding ensemble."	0
"31995732"	"Structural and Biophysical Analysis of the CLCA1 VWA Domain Suggests Mode of TMEM16A Engagement.The secreted protein calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) utilizes a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain to bind to and potentiate the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A. To gain insight into this unique potentiation mechanism, we determined the 2.0-Å crystal structure of human CLCA1 VWA bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The structure reveals the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in a high-affinity ""open"" conformation, engaging in crystal contacts that likely mimic how CLCA1 engages TMEM16A. The CLCA1 VWA contains a disulfide bond between α3 and α4 in close proximity to the MIDAS that is invariant in the CLCA family and unique in VWA structures. Further biophysical studies indicate that CLCA1 VWA is preferably stabilized by Mg<sup>2+</sup> over Ca<sup>2+</sup> and that α6 atypically extends from the VWA core. Finally, an analysis of TMEM16A structures suggests residues likely to mediate interaction with CLCA1 VWA."	0
"32126208"	"Structures of Gα Proteins in Complex with Their Chaperone Reveal Quality Control Mechanisms.Many chaperones promote nascent polypeptide folding followed by substrate release through ATP-dependent conformational changes. Here we show cryoEM structures of Gα subunit folding intermediates in complex with full-length Ric-8A, a unique chaperone-client system in which substrate release is facilitated by guanine nucleotide binding to the client G protein. The structures of Ric-8A-Gα<sub>i</sub> and Ric-8A-Gα<sub>q</sub> complexes reveal that the chaperone employs its extended C-terminal region to cradle the Ras-like domain of Gα, positioning the Ras core in contact with the Ric-8A core while engaging its switch2 nucleotide binding region. The C-terminal α5 helix of Gα is held away from the Ras-like domain through Ric-8A core domain interactions, which critically depend on recognition of the Gα C terminus by the chaperone. The structures, complemented with biochemical and cellular chaperoning data, support a folding quality control mechanism that ensures proper formation of the C-terminal α5 helix before allowing GTP-gated release of Gα from Ric-8A."	0
"32460027"	"A Landscape of Murine Long Non-Coding RNAs Reveals the Leading Transcriptome Alterations in Adipose Tissue during Aging.Aging is an inevitable process that involves profound physiological changes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in various biological processes but are not systemically studied in aging. To provide an organism-wide lncRNA landscape during aging, we conduct comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses across the mouse lifespan. Of the 1,675 aging-regulated lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) identified, the majority are connected to inflammation-related biological pathways. AR-lncRNAs exhibit high tissue specificity; conversely, those with higher tissue specificity are preferentially regulated during aging. White adipose tissue (WAT) displays the highest number of AR-lncRNAs and develops the most dynamic crosstalk between AR-lncRNA and AR-mRNA during aging. An adipose-enriched AR-lncRNA, lnc-adipoAR1, is negatively correlated with aging, and knocking it down inhibits adipogenesis, phenocopying the compromised adipogenic capacity of aged fat. Our works together reveal AR-lncRNAs as essential components in aging and suggest that although each tissue ages in a distinct manner, WAT is a leading contributor to aging-related health decline."	0
"32726636"	"GSK3 Inhibits Macropinocytosis and Lysosomal Activity through the Wnt Destruction Complex Machinery.Canonical Wnt signaling is emerging as a major regulator of endocytosis. Here, we report that Wnt-induced macropinocytosis is regulated through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the β-catenin destruction complex. We find that mutation of Axin1, a tumor suppressor and component of the destruction complex, results in the activation of macropinocytosis. Surprisingly, inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021, or dominant-negative GSK3 triggers macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition causes a rapid increase in acidic endolysosomes that is independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increases lysosomal activity, which can be followed with tracers of active cathepsin D, β-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation. Microinjection of LiCl into the blastula cavity of Xenopus embryos causes a striking increase in dextran macropinocytosis. The effects of GSK3 inhibition on protein degradation in endolysosomes are blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA or IPA-3, suggesting that increases in membrane trafficking drive lysosomal activity."	0
"30612879"	"The Crohn's Disease Risk Factor IRGM Limits NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Impeding Its Assembly and by Mediating Its Selective Autophagy.Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn's disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders."	1
"32487747"	"How the assembly and protection of the bacterial cell envelope depend on cysteine residues.The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a multilayered structure essential for bacterial viability; the peptidoglycan cell wall provides shape and osmotic protection to the cell, and the outer membrane serves as a permeability barrier against noxious compounds in the external environment. Assembling the envelope properly and maintaining its integrity are matters of life and death for bacteria. Our understanding of the mechanisms of envelope assembly and maintenance has increased tremendously over the past two decades. Here, we review the major achievements made during this time, giving central stage to the amino acid cysteine, one of the least abundant amino acid residues in proteins, whose unique chemical and physical properties often critically support biological processes. First, we review how cysteines contribute to envelope homeostasis by forming stabilizing disulfides in crucial bacterial assembly factors (LptD, BamA, and FtsN) and stress sensors (RcsF and NlpE). Second, we highlight the emerging role of enzymes that use cysteine residues to catalyze reactions that are necessary for proper envelope assembly, and we also explain how these enzymes are protected from oxidative inactivation. Finally, we suggest future areas of investigation, including a discussion of how cysteine residues could contribute to envelope homeostasis by functioning as redox switches. By highlighting the redox pathways that are active in the envelope of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we provide a timely overview of the assembly of a cellular compartment that is the hallmark of Gram-negative bacteria."	0
"32692975"	"Structure of the Inhibited State of the Sec Translocon.Protein secretion in eukaryotes and prokaryotes involves a universally conserved protein translocation channel formed by the Sec61 complex. Unrelated small-molecule natural products and synthetic compounds inhibit Sec61 with differential effects for different substrates or for Sec61 from different organisms, making this a promising target for therapeutic intervention. To understand the mode of inhibition and provide insight into the molecular mechanism of this dynamic translocon, we determined the structure of mammalian Sec61 inhibited by the Mycobacterium ulcerans exotoxin mycolactone via electron cryo-microscopy. Unexpectedly, the conformation of inhibited Sec61 is optimal for substrate engagement, with mycolactone wedging open the cytosolic side of the lateral gate. The inability of mycolactone-inhibited Sec61 to effectively transport substrate proteins implies that signal peptides and transmembrane domains pass through the site occupied by mycolactone. This provides a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism of Sec61 inhibitors and reveals novel features of translocon function and dynamics."	0
"31733993"	"Lineage-Restricted Regulation of SCD and Fatty Acid Saturation by MITF Controls Melanoma Phenotypic Plasticity.Phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity within tumors is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. How metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. In melanoma, downregulation of the lineage addiction oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, although how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here, we show that MITF is a lineage-restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and that SCD is required for MITF<sup>High</sup> melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITF<sup>Low</sup> cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signaling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback loop that maintains de-differentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineage-specific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates the response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism."	1

We report that remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.01 μM). Weaker activity is observed in Vero E6 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.65 μM) because of their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with the chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminishes lung viral load and improves pulmonary function compared with vehicle-treated animals.

"32877683"	"An Epilepsy-Associated GRIN2A Rare Variant Disrupts CaMKIIα Phosphorylation of GluN2A and NMDA Receptor Trafficking.Rare variants in GRIN genes, which encode NMDAR subunits, are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these, GRIN2A, which encodes the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, is widely accepted as an epilepsy-causative gene. Here, we functionally characterize the de novo GluN2A-S1459G mutation identified in an epilepsy patient. We show that S1459 is a CaMKIIα phosphorylation site, and that endogenous phosphorylation is regulated during development and in response to synaptic activity in a dark rearing model. GluN2A-S1459 phosphorylation results in preferential binding of NMDARs to SNX27 and a corresponding decrease in PSD-95 binding, which consequently regulates NMDAR trafficking. Furthermore, the epilepsy-associated GluN2A-S1459G variant displays defects in interactions with both SNX27 and PSD-95, resulting in trafficking deficits, reduced spine density, and decreased excitatory synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate a role for CaMKIIα phosphorylation of GluN2A in receptor targeting and implicate NMDAR trafficking defects as a link to epilepsy."	1
"32433972"	"Predicting mRNA Abundance Directly from Genomic Sequence Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity.

Recently, we have designed synthetic cytokine receptors (SyCyRs) consisting of GFP and mCherry nanobodies fused to transmembrane and intracellular domains of cytokine receptors that phenocopy cytokine signaling induced by nonphysiological homo- and heterodimeric GFP-mCherry ligands. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) signals via both IL-22 receptor α1 (IL-22Rα1) and the common IL-10R2, belongs to the IL-10 cytokine family, and is critically involved in tissue regeneration. Here, IL-22 SyCyRs phenocopied native IL-22 signal transduction, indicated by induction of cytokine-dependent cellular proliferation, signal transduction, and transcriptome analysis. Whereas homodimeric IL-22Rα1 SyCyRs failed to activate signaling, homodimerization of the second IL-22 signaling chain, SyCyR(IL-10R2), which previously was considered not to induce signal transduction, led to induction of signal transduction. Interestingly, the SyCyR(IL-10R2) and SyCyR(IL-22Rα1) constructs could form functional heterodimeric receptor signaling complexes with the synthetic IL-6 receptor chain SyCyR(gp130). In summary, we have demonstrated that IL-22 signaling can be phenocopied by synthetic cytokine receptors, identified a functional IL-10R2 homodimeric receptor complex, and uncovered broad receptor cross-talk of IL-22Rα1 and IL-20R2 with gp130."	0
"32059760"	"A Conserved Kinase-Based Body-Temperature Sensor Globally Controls Alternative Splicing and Gene Expression.Homeothermic organisms maintain their core body temperature in a narrow, tightly controlled range.

Furthermore, a thermo-sensor capable of sensing the small temperature differentials leading to temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in poikilothermic reptiles has not been identified. Here, we show that the activity of CDC-like kinases (CLKs) is highly responsive to physiological temperature changes, which is conferred by structural rearrangements within the kinase activation segment. Lower body temperature activates CLKs resulting in strongly increased phosphorylation of SR proteins in vitro and in vivo. This globally controls temperature-dependent alternative splicing and gene expression, with wide implications in circadian, tissue-specific, and disease-associated settings. This temperature sensor is conserved across evolution and adapted to growth temperatures of diverse poikilotherms. The dynamic temperature range of reptilian CLK homologs suggests a role in TSD."	1

Interestingly, D76N-associated amyloidosis has a distinctive pathology compared with aggregation of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m, which occurs in dialysis-related amyloidosis. A folding intermediate of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m, known as the I<sub>T</sub>-state, which contains a nonnative <i>trans</i> Pro-32, has been shown to be a key precursor of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m aggregation <i>in vitro</i> However, how a single amino acid substitution enhances the rate of aggregation of D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m and gives rise to a different amyloid disease remained unclear. Using real-time refolding experiments monitored by CD and NMR, we show that the folding mechanisms of WT- and D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m are conserved in that both proteins fold slowly via an I<sub>T</sub>-state that has similar structural properties. Surprisingly, however, direct measurement of the equilibrium population of I<sub>T</sub> using NMR showed no evidence for an increased population of the I<sub>T</sub>-state for D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m, ruling out previous models suggesting that this could explain its enhanced aggregation propensity. Producing a kinetically trapped analog of I<sub>T</sub> by deleting the N-terminal six amino acids increases the aggregation rate of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m but slows aggregation of D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m, supporting the view that although the folding mechanisms of the two proteins are conserved, their aggregation mechanisms differ. The results exclude the I<sub>T</sub>-state as the origin of the rapid aggregation of D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m, suggesting that other nonnative states must cause its high aggregation rate. The results highlight how a single substitution at a solvent-exposed site can affect the mechanism of aggregation and the resulting disease."	0

The interaction with CCR4-NOT is mediated by previously uncharacterized sites in the middle region of 4E-T. Importantly, mRNA decapping and decay are inhibited by 4E-T and the deadenylated target is stored in a repressed form. Inhibition of mRNA decapping requires the interaction of 4E-T with the cap-binding proteins eIF4E/4EHP. We further show that regulation of decapping by 4E-T participates in mRNA repression by the miRNA effector protein TNRC6B and that 4E-T overexpression interferes with tristetraprolin (TTP)- and NOT1-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, we postulate that 4E-T modulates 5'-to-3' decay by swapping the fate of a deadenylated mRNA from complete degradation to storage. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of mRNA storage that controls localized translation and mRNA stability in P-bodies."	1
"32755590"	"Single-Cell RNA Profiling Reveals Adipocyte to Macrophage Signaling Sufficient to Enhance Thermogenesis.Adipocytes deficient in fatty acid synthase (iAdFASNKO) emit signals that mimic cold exposure to enhance the appearance of thermogenic beige adipocytes in mouse inguinal white adipose tissues (iWATs). Both cold exposure and iAdFASNKO upregulate the sympathetic nerve fiber (SNF) modulator Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), activate SNFs, and require adipocyte cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling for beige adipocyte appearance, as it is blocked by adipocyte Gsα deficiency. Surprisingly, however, in contrast to cold-exposed mice, neither iWAT denervation nor Nrg4 loss attenuated adipocyte browning in iAdFASNKO mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of iWAT stromal cells revealed increased macrophages displaying gene expression signatures of the alternately activated type in iAdFASNKO mice, and their depletion abrogated iWAT beiging. Altogether, these findings reveal that divergent cellular pathways are sufficient to cause adipocyte browning. Importantly, adipocyte signaling to enhance alternatively activated macrophages in iAdFASNKO mice is associated with enhanced adipose thermogenesis independent of the sympathetic neuron involvement this process requires in the cold."	0
"32209479"	"Cannabinoids Rescue Cocaine-Induced Seizures by Restoring Brain Glycine Receptor Dysfunction.Cannabinoids are reported to rescue cocaine-induced seizures (CISs), a severe complication in cocaine users. However, the molecular targets for cannabinoid therapy of CISs remain unclear. Here, we report that the systemic administration of cannabinoids alleviates CISs in a CB<sub>1</sub>/CB<sub>2</sub>-receptor-independent manner. In HEK293 cells and cortical neurons, cocaine-induced dysfunction of the glycine receptor (GlyR) is restored by cannabinoids. Such restoration is blocked by GlyRα1<sup>S296A</sup> mutation. Consistently, the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids on CISs are also eliminated in GlyRα1<sup>S296A</sup> mutant mice. Based on molecular dynamic simulation, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between cocaine and the GlyR is weakened by cannabinoid docking. Without altering cocaine distribution across the brain, cannabinoids significantly suppress cocaine-exaggerated neuronal excitability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus by rehabilitating extra-synaptic GlyR function. Microinjection of cannabinoids into the PFC and hippocampus restores cocaine-puzzled neural activity and alleviates CISs. These findings suggest that using GlyR-hypersensitive cannabinoids may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating CISs."	0

While much has been learned regarding transcription factors, the function of epigenetic regulators in these networks is less well defined. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function genetic screen that identified two epigenetic regulators, TAF5L and TAF6L, components or co-activators of the GNAT-HAT complexes for the mouse ESC (mESC) state. Detailed molecular studies demonstrate that TAF5L/TAF6L transcriptionally activate c-Myc and Oct4 and their corresponding MYC and CORE regulatory networks. Besides, TAF5L/TAF6L predominantly regulate their target genes through H3K9ac deposition and c-MYC recruitment that eventually activate the MYC regulatory network for self-renewal of mESCs. Thus, our findings uncover a role of TAF5L/TAF6L in directing the MYC regulatory network that orchestrates gene expression programs to control self-renewal for the maintenance of mESC state."	0
"32075767"	"Defective Mitochondrial Pyruvate Flux Affects Cell Bioenergetics in Alzheimer's Disease-Related Models.Mitochondria are key organelles for brain health. Mitochondrial alterations have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms appears crucial to understand their relationship with the pathology. Using multiple genetic, pharmacological, imaging, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that, in different familial AD cell models, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is affected. The defect depends on reduced mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, due to both lower Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated stimulation of the Krebs cycle and dampened mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Importantly, this latter event is linked to glycogen-synthase-kinase-3β (GSK-3β) hyper-activation, leading, in turn, to impaired recruitment of hexokinase 1 (HK1) to mitochondria, destabilization of mitochondrial-pyruvate-carrier (MPC) complexes, and decreased MPC2 protein levels. Remarkably, pharmacological GSK-3β inhibition in AD cells rescues MPC2 expression and improves mitochondrial ATP synthesis and respiration. The defective mitochondrial bioenergetics influences glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity, thus representing a possible target for future therapeutic interventions."	0

The pathogenicity and establishment of <i>S. aureus</i> infections are tightly linked to its ability to modulate host immunity. Persistent infections are often associated with mutant staphylococcal strains that have decreased susceptibility to antibiotics; however, little is known about how these mutations influence bacterial interaction with the host immune system. Here, we discovered that clinical <i>S. aureus</i> isolates activate human monocytes, leading to cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands on the monocytes. We found that expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 (UL16-binding protein 2) is associated with bacterial degradability and phagolysosomal activity. Moreover, <i>S. aureus</i>-induced ULBP2 expression was linked to altered host cell metabolism, including increased cytoplasmic (iso)citrate levels, reduced glycolytic flux, and functional mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that the ability of <i>S. aureus</i> to induce ULBP2 and proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes depends on a functional ClpP protease in <i>S. aureus</i> These findings indicate that <i>S. aureus</i> activates ULBP2 in human monocytes through immunometabolic mechanisms and reveal that <i>clpP</i> inactivation may function as a potential immune evasion mechanism. Our results provide critical insight into the interplay between the host immune system and <i>S. aureus</i> that has evolved under the dual selective pressure of host immune responses and antibiotic treatment. Our discovery of an immune stimulatory pathway consisting of human monocyte-based defense against <i>S. aureus</i> suggests that targeting the NKG2D pathway holds potential for managing persistent staphylococcal infections."	0
"32375045"	"REST Inhibits Direct Reprogramming of Pancreatic Exocrine to Endocrine Cells by Preventing PDX1-Mediated Activation of Endocrine Genes.The emerging appreciation of plasticity among pancreatic lineages has created interest in harnessing cellular reprogramming for β cell replacement therapy of diabetes. Current reprogramming methodologies are inefficient, largely because of a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Using an in vitro reprogramming system, we reveal the transcriptional repressor RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) as a barrier for β cell gene expression in the reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells. We observe that REST-bound loci lie adjacent to the binding sites of multiple key β cell transcription factors, including PDX1. Accordingly, a loss of REST function combined with PDX1 expression results in the synergistic activation of endocrine genes. This is accompanied by increased histone acetylation and PDX1 binding at endocrine gene loci. Collectively, our data identify a mechanism for REST activity involving the prevention of PDX1-mediated activation of endocrine genes and uncover REST downregulation and the resulting chromatin alterations as key events in β cell reprogramming."	0
"32814050"	"Fractalkine-Dependent Microglial Pruning of Viable Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells Regulates Myelination.Oligodendrogenesis occurs during early postnatal development, coincident with neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, raising the possibility that microglia-dependent pruning mechanisms that modulate neurons regulate myelin sheath formation. Here we show a population of ameboid microglia migrating from the ventricular zone into the corpus callosum during early postnatal development, termed ""the fountain of microglia,"" phagocytosing viable oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) before onset of myelination. Fractalkine receptor-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in microglial engulfment of viable OPCs, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and reduced myelin thickness but no change in axon number. These data provide evidence that microglia phagocytose OPCs as a homeostatic mechanism for proper myelination. A hallmark of hypomyelinating developmental disorders such as periventricular leukomalacia and of adult demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is increased numbers of oligodendrocytes but failure to myelinate, suggesting that microglial pruning of OPCs may be impaired in pathological states and hinder myelination."	0
"30956044"	"The Landscape of L1 Retrotransposons in the Human Genome Is Shaped by Pre-insertion Sequence Biases and Post-insertion Selection.L1 retrotransposons are transposable elements and major contributors of genetic variation in humans. Where L1 integrates into the genome can directly impact human evolution and disease. Here, we experimentally induced L1 retrotransposition in cells and mapped integration sites at nucleotide resolution. At local scales, L1 integration is mostly restricted by genome sequence biases and the specificity of the L1 machinery. At regional scales, L1 shows a broad capacity for integration into all chromatin states, in contrast to other known mobile genetic elements. However, integration is influenced by the replication timing of target regions, suggesting a link to host DNA replication. The distribution of new L1 integrations differs from those of preexisting L1 copies, which are significantly reshaped by natural selection. Our findings reveal that the L1 machinery has evolved to efficiently target all genomic regions and underline a predominant role for post-integrative processes on the distribution of endogenous L1 elements."	0

Given that macrophages play a major role in inflammation, we studied the contribution of Mfn2 to the activity of these cells. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced Mfn2 expression. The use of the Mfn2 and Mfn1 myeloid-conditional knockout (KO) mouse models reveals that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is required for the adaptation of mitochondrial respiration to stress conditions and for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon pro-inflammatory activation. Mfn2 deficiency specifically impairs the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. In addition, the lack of Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is associated with dysfunctional autophagy, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and antigen processing. Mfn2<sup>floxed;CreLysM</sup> mice fail to be protected from Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or LPS endotoxemia. These results reveal an unexpected contribution of Mfn2 to ROS production and inflammation in macrophages."	0
"32299913"	"The SHCA adapter protein cooperates with lipoma-preferred partner in the regulation of adhesion dynamics and invadopodia formation.SHC adaptor protein (SHCA) and lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) mediate transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Reduced expression of either protein diminishes breast cancer lung metastasis, but the reason for this effect is unclear. Here, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that TGFβ enhanced the assembly and disassembly rates of paxillin-containing adhesions in an SHCA-dependent manner through the phosphorylation of the specific SHCA tyrosine residues Tyr-239, Tyr-240, and Tyr-313. Using a BioID proximity labeling approach, we show that SHCA exists in a complex with a variety of actin cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin and LPP. Consistent with a functional interaction between SHCA and LPP, TGFβ-induced LPP localization to cellular adhesions depended on SHCA. Once localized to the adhesions, LPP was required for TGFβ-induced increases in cell migration and adhesion dynamics. Mutations that impaired LPP localization to adhesions (mLIM1) or impeded interactions with the actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin (ΔABD) abrogated migratory responses to TGFβ. Live-cell TIRF microscopy revealed that SHCA clustering at the cell membrane preceded LPP recruitment. We therefore hypothesize that, in the presence of TGFβ, SHCA promotes the formation of small, dynamic adhesions by acting as a nucleator of focal complex formation. Finally, we defined a previously unknown function for SHCA in the formation of invadopodia, a process that also required LPP. Our results reveal that SHCA controls the formation and function of adhesions and invadopodia, two key cellular structures required for breast cancer metastasis."	0
"30554948"	"The F-Box Domain-Dependent Activity of EMI1 Regulates PARPi Sensitivity in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers.The BRCA1-BRCA2-RAD51 axis is essential for homologous recombination repair (HRR) and is frequently disrupted in breast cancers. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are used clinically to treat BRCA-mutated breast tumors. Using a genetic screen, we identified EMI1 as a modulator of PARPi sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This function requires the F-box domain of EMI1, through which EMI1 assembles a canonical SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that constitutively targets RAD51 for degradation. In response to genotoxic stress, CHK1-mediated phosphorylation of RAD51 counteracts EMI1-dependent degradation by enhancing RAD51's affinity for BRCA2, leading to RAD51 accumulation. Inhibition of RAD51 degradation restores HRR in BRCA1-depleted cells. Human breast cancer samples display an inverse correlation between EMI1 and RAD51 protein levels. A subset of BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells develop resistance to PARPi by downregulating EMI1 and restoring RAD51-dependent HRR. Notably, reconstitution of EMI1 expression reestablishes PARPi sensitivity both in cellular systems and in an orthotopic mouse model."	1
"30952514"	"Dynamic Recruitment of Single RNAs to Processing Bodies Depends on RNA Functionality.Cellular RNAs often colocalize with cytoplasmic, membrane-less ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules enriched for RNA-processing enzymes, termed processing bodies (PBs). Here we track the dynamic localization of individual miRNAs, mRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to PBs using intracellular single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We find that unused miRNAs stably bind to PBs, whereas functional miRNAs, repressed mRNAs, and lncRNAs both transiently and stably localize within either the core or periphery of PBs, albeit to different extents. Consequently, translation potential and 3' versus 5' placement of miRNA target sites significantly affect the PB localization dynamics of mRNAs. Using computational modeling and supporting experimental approaches, we show that partitioning in the PB phase attenuates mRNA silencing, suggesting that physiological mRNA turnover occurs predominantly outside of PBs. Instead, our data support a PB role in sequestering unused miRNAs for surveillance and provide a framework for investigating the dynamic assembly of RNP granules by phase separation at single-molecule resolution."	0
"31940495"	"Targeting the Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNA SLNCR1 by Blocking Its Sequence-Specific Binding to the Androgen Receptor.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of numerous physiological processes and diseases, especially cancers. However, development of lncRNA-based therapies is limited because the mechanisms of many lncRNAs are obscure, and interactions with functional partners, including proteins, remain uncharacterized. The lncRNA SLNCR1 binds to and regulates the androgen receptor (AR) to mediate melanoma invasion and proliferation in an androgen-independent manner. Here, we use biochemical analyses coupled with selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) RNA structure probing to show that the N-terminal domain of AR binds a pyrimidine-rich motif in an unstructured region of SLNCR1. This motif is predictive of AR binding, as we identify an AR-binding motif in lncRNA HOXA11-AS-203. Oligonucleotides that bind either the AR N-terminal domain or the AR RNA motif block the SLNCR1-AR interaction and reduce SLNCR1-mediated melanoma invasion. Delivery of oligos that block SLNCR1-AR interaction thus represent a plausible therapeutic strategy."	0
"32268107"	"Structure of Super-Potent Antibody CAP256-VRC26.25 in Complex with HIV-1 Envelope Reveals a Combined Mode of Trimer-Apex Recognition.Antibodies targeting the V1V2 apex of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer comprise one of the most commonly elicited categories of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Structures of these antibodies indicate diverse modes of Env recognition typified by antibodies of the PG9 class and the PGT145 class. The mode of recognition, however, has been unclear for the most potent of the V1V2 apex-targeting antibodies, CAP256-VRC26.25 (named for donor-lineage.clone and referred to hereafter as VRC26.25). Here, we determine the cryoelectron microscopy structure at 3.7 Å resolution of the antigen-binding fragment of VRC26.25 in complex with the Env trimer thought to have initiated the lineage. The 36-residue protruding loop of VRC26.25 displays recognition incorporating both strand-C interactions similar to the PG9 class and V1V2 apex insertion similar to the PGT145 class. Structural elements of separate antibody classes can thus intermingle to form a ""combined"" class, which in this case yields an antibody of extraordinary potency."	0
"32521260"	"Kainate Receptor Activation Shapes Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity by Controlling Receptor Lateral Mobility at Glutamatergic Synapses.Kainate receptors (KARs) mediate postsynaptic currents with a key impact on neuronal excitability. However, the molecular determinants controlling KAR postsynaptic localization and stabilization are poorly understood. Here, we exploit optogenetic and single-particle tracking approaches to study the role of KAR conformational states induced by glutamate binding on KAR lateral mobility at synapses. We report that following glutamate binding, KARs are readily and reversibly trapped at glutamatergic synapses through increased interaction with the β-catenin/N-cadherin complex. We demonstrate that such activation-dependent synaptic immobilization of KARs is crucial for the modulation of short-term plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Thus, the present study unveils the crosstalk between conformational states and lateral mobility of KARs, a mechanism regulating glutamatergic signaling, particularly in conditions of sustained synaptic activity."	0
"32783929"	"Persistent Activation of mRNA Translation by Transient Hsp90 Inhibition.The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone functions as a protein-folding buffer and plays a role promoting the evolution of new heritable traits. To better understand how Hsp90 can affect mRNA translation, we screen more than 1,600 factors involved in mRNA regulation for physical interactions with Hsp90 in human cells. The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 results in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persists for 30 generations after the inhibitor is removed. Ribosomal profiling reveals that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, transient loss of Hsp90 function can promote a nongenetic inheritance of a translational state affecting specific mRNAs, introducing a mechanism by which Hsp90 can promote phenotypic variation."	0
"32553192"	"Intrinsically Disordered Regions Direct Transcription Factor In Vivo Binding Specificity.Transcription factors (TFs) that bind common DNA motifs in vitro occupy distinct sets of promoters in vivo, raising the question of how binding specificity is achieved. TFs are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions commonly form promiscuous interactions, yet their unique properties might also benefit specific binding-site selection. We examine this using Msn2 and Yap1, TFs of distinct families that contain long IDRs outside their DNA-binding domains. We find that these IDRs are both necessary and sufficient for localizing to the majority of target promoters. This IDR-directed binding does not depend on any localized domain but results from a multitude of weak determinants distributed throughout the entire IDR sequence. Furthermore, IDR specificity is conserved between distant orthologs, suggesting direct interaction with multiple promoters. We propose that distribution of sensing determinants along extended IDRs accelerates binding-site detection by rapidly localizing TFs to broad DNA regions surrounding these sites."	0

To understand how these variants lead to the phenotypic convergence in KSS, we employ a loss-of-function approach to assess neuronal network development at the molecular, single-cell, and network activity level. KSS-gene-deficient neuronal networks all develop into hyperactive networks with altered network organization and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Interestingly, even though transcriptional data reveal distinct regulatory mechanisms, KSS target genes share similar functions in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function, several of which are associated with ID and ASD. Our results show that KSS genes mainly converge at the level of neuronal network communication, providing insights into the pathophysiology of KSS and phenotypically congruent disorders."	0

Under optimized experimental conditions, GECIs detect single action potentials in individual cells with high accuracy. However, using current approaches, these optimized conditions are never met when imaging large ensembles of neurons. Here, we developed a method that substantially increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of population imaging of GECIs by using galvanometric mirrors and fast smart line scan (SLS) trajectories. We validated our approach in anesthetized and awake mice on deep and dense GCaMP6 staining in the mouse barrel cortex during spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. Compared to raster population imaging, SLS led to increased SNR, higher probability of detecting calcium events, and more precise identification of functional neuronal ensembles. SLS provides a cheap and easily implementable tool for high-accuracy population imaging of neural GCaMP6 signals by using galvanometric-based two-photon microscopes."	0

Chronic hepatitis B develops by the interaction between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and host immune response. However, questions of how HBV-infected cells thwart immune system defenses remain unanswered. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are used for cellular communication, carrying cargoes such as RNAs, proteins, and lipids and delivering them intracellularly after being endocytosed by target cells. HBV-infected liver cells secrete several types of EVs into body fluids such as complete and incomplete virions, and exosomes. We previously demonstrated that monocytes that incorporated EVs moved to immunoregulatory phenotypes via up-regulation of PD-L1, an immunocheckpoint molecule, and down-regulation of CD69, a leukocyte activation molecule. In this study, we transfected mice with HBV using hydrodynamic injection and studied the effects of EVs secreted by HBV-infected liver cells. EVs secreted from cells with HBV replication strongly suppressed the immune response, inhibiting the eradication of HBV-replicating cells in the mice transfected with HBV. EVs were systemically incorporated in multiple organs, including liver, bone marrow (BM), and intestine. Intriguingly, the BM cells that incorporated EVs acquired intestinal tropism and the dendritic cell populations in the intestine increased. These findings suggest that the EVs secreted by HBV-infected liver cells exert immunosuppressive functions, and that an association between the liver, bone marrow, and intestinal tract exists through EVs secreted from HBV-infected cells."	0
"32553161"	"Brain Circuit of Claustrophobia-like Behavior in Mice Identified by Upstream Tracing of Sighing.Emotions are distinct patterns of behavioral and physiological responses triggered by stimuli that induce different brain states. Elucidating the circuits is difficult because of challenges in interrogating emotional brain states and their complex outputs. Here, we leverage the recent discovery in mice of a neural circuit for sighing, a simple, quantifiable output of various emotions. We show that mouse confinement triggers sighing, and this ""claustrophobic"" sighing, but not accompanying tachypnea, requires the same medullary neuromedin B (Nmb)-expressing neurons as physiological sighing. Retrograde tracing from the Nmb neurons identified 12 forebrain centers providing presynaptic input, including hypocretin (Hcrt)-expressing lateral hypothalamic neurons. Confinement activates Hcrt neurons, and optogenetic activation induces sighing and tachypnea whereas pharmacologic inhibition suppresses both responses. The effect on sighing is mediated by HCRT directly on Nmbneurons. We propose that this HCRT-NMB neuropeptide relay circuit mediates claustrophobic sighing and that activated Hcrt neurons are a claustrophobia brain state that directly controls claustrophobic outputs."	0

Members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases are known for their anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and anti-inflammatory roles. Here, we identify an unexpected role of TAM kinases as promoters of necroptosis, a pro-inflammatory necrotic cell death. Pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TAM kinases results in a potent inhibition of necroptotic death in various cellular models. We identify phosphorylation of MLKL Tyr376 as a direct point of input from TAM kinases into the necroptosis signaling. The oligomerization of MLKL, but not its membranal translocation or phosphorylation by RIPK3, is controlled by TAM kinases. Importantly, both knockout and inhibition of TAM kinases protect mice from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, this study discovers that immunosuppressant TAM kinases are promoters of pro-inflammatory necroptosis, shedding light on the biological complexity of the regulation of inflammation."	1
"31995749"	"Regulatory T Cells Condition Lymphatic Endothelia for Enhanced Transendothelial Migration.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of cell surface lymphotoxin alpha beta (LTα1β2) to activate the LT beta receptor (LTβR) on the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), modulating LEC adhesion molecules, intercellular junctions, and chemokines. We demonstrate a role for Tregs through this pathway to condition the permissiveness of lymphatic endothelia for transendothelial migration (TEM), thus gating leukocyte traffic. Human Tregs share the same property with murine Tregs. Activation of TLR2 on Tregs during inflammation specifically augments LTα1β2-LTβR signaling, which further enhances the permissiveness of LECs to facilitate TEM. The conditioning of endothelia may promote the resolution of inflammation by directing leukocytes out of tissues to lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, Tregs interact with lymphatic endothelia under homeostasis and inflammation and dictate endothelial permissiveness and gating mechanisms for subsequent leukocyte migration through endothelial barriers."	0
"32160534"	"Lipid Oxidation Induced by RF Waves and Mediated by Ferritin Iron Causes Activation of Ferritin-Tagged Ion Channels.One approach to magnetogenetics uses radiofrequency (RF) waves to activate transient receptor potential channels (TRPV1 and TRPV4) that are coupled to cellular ferritins. The mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear and controversial. Theoretical calculations suggest that the heat produced by RF fields is likely orders of magnitude weaker than needed for channel activation. Using the FeRIC (Ferritin iron Redistribution to Ion Channels) system, we have uncovered a mechanism of activation of ferritin-tagged channels via a biochemical pathway initiated by RF disturbance of ferritin and mediated by ferritin-associated iron. We show that, in cells expressing TRPV<sup>FeRIC</sup> channels, RF increases the levels of the labile iron pool in a ferritin-dependent manner. Free iron participates in chemical reactions, producing reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids that ultimately activate the TRPV<sup>FeRIC</sup> channels. This biochemical pathway predicts a similar RF-induced activation of other lipid-sensitive TRP channels and may guide future magnetogenetic designs."	0

Addressing the critical gaps in our understanding of the adaptive molecular events downstream ROS provocation holds promise for the identification of druggable metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we unveil a direct molecular link between the activity of two estrogen-related receptor (ERR) isoforms and the control of glutamine utilization and glutathione antioxidant production. ERRα down-regulation restricts glutamine entry into the TCA cycle, while ERRγ up-regulation promotes glutamine-driven glutathione production. Notably, we identify increased ERRγ expression/activation as a hallmark of oxidative stress triggered by mitochondrial disruption or chemotherapy. Enhanced tumor antioxidant capacity is an underlying feature of human breast cancer (BCa) patients that respond poorly to treatment. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of ERRγ with the selective inverse agonist GSK5182 increases antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel on poor outcome BCa tumor organoids. Our findings thus underscore the ERRs as novel redox sensors and effectors of a ROS defense program and highlight the potential therapeutic advantage of exploiting ERRγ inhibitors for the treatment of BCa and other diseases where oxidative stress plays a central role."	0

On LCV biogenesis, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (v-SNARE) Sec22b is recruited to the bacterial phagosome and forms non-canonical pairings with target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs) from the plasma membrane. Here, we identify a Legionella deubiquitinase (DUB), LotB, that can modulate the early secretory pathway by interacting with coatomer protein complex I (COPI) vesicles when ectopically expressed. We show that Sec22b is ubiquitinated upon L. pneumophila infection in a T4SS-dependent manner and that, subsequently, LotB deconjugates K63-linked ubiquitins from Sec22b. The DUB activity of LotB stimulates dissociation of the t-SNARE syntaxin 3 (Stx3) from Sec22b, which resides on the LCV.

The 90S (SSU-processome) is the earliest pre-ribosome structurally analyzed, which was suggested to assemble stepwise along the growing pre-rRNA from 5' > 3', but this directionality may not be accurate. Here, by analyzing the structure of a series of 90S assembly intermediates from Chaetomium thermophilum, we discover a reverse order of 18S rRNA subdomain incorporation. Large parts of the 18S rRNA 3' and central domains assemble first into the 90S before the 5' domain is integrated. This final incorporation depends on a contact between a heterotrimer Enp2-Bfr2-Lcp5 recruited to the flexible 5' domain and Kre33, which reconstitutes the Kre33-Enp-Brf2-Lcp5 module on the compacted 90S. Keeping the 5' domain temporarily segregated from the 90S scaffold could provide extra time to complete the multifaceted 5' domain folding, which depends on a distinct set of snoRNAs and processing factors."	0

FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation. GSK-3β phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP to activate FBXL21-mediated, phosphodegron-dependent TCAP degradation. GSK-3β inhibition or knockdown diminishes FBXL21-Cul1 complex formation and delays FBXL21-mediated TCAP degradation. Finally, Psttm mice show significant skeletal muscle defects, including impaired fiber size, exercise tolerance, grip strength, and response to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy, in conjunction with cardiac dysfunction. These data highlight a circadian regulatory pathway where a GSK-3β-FBXL21 functional axis controls TCAP degradation via SCF complex formation and regulates skeletal muscle function."	1
"31952989"	"Aifm2, a NADH Oxidase, Supports Robust Glycolysis and Is Required for Cold- and Diet-Induced Thermogenesis.Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is highly metabolically active tissue that dissipates energy via UCP1 as heat, and BAT mass is correlated negatively with obesity. The presence of BAT/BAT-like tissue in humans renders BAT as an attractive target against obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we identify Aifm2, a NADH oxidoreductase domain containing flavoprotein, as a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein highly enriched in BAT. Aifm2 is induced by cold as well as by diet. Upon cold or β-adrenergic stimulation, Aifm2 associates with the outer side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a unique BAT-specific first mammalian NDE (external NADH dehydrogenase)-like enzyme, Aifm2 oxidizes NADH to maintain high cytosolic NAD levels in supporting robust glycolysis and to transfer electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) for fueling thermogenesis. Aifm2 in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) promotes oxygen consumption, uncoupled respiration, and heat production during cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. Aifm2, thus, can ameliorate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance."	0
"32101749"	"Tumor-Derived Lactic Acid Contributes to the Paucity of Intratumoral ILC2s.Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are abundant in non-lymphoid tissues and increase following infectious and inflammatory insults. In solid tumors, however, ILC2s constitute a relatively small proportion of immune cells. Here, we show, using melanoma as a model, that while the IL-33/IL C2/eosinophil axis suppresses tumor growth, tumor-derived lactate attenuates the function and survival of ILC2s. Melanomas with reduced lactate production (LDHA<sup>low</sup>) are growth delayed and typified by an increased number of ILC2s compared with control tumors. Upon IL-33 stimulation, ILC2s accompanied by eosinophils more effectively restrain the growth of LDHA<sup>low</sup> tumors than control melanomas. Furthermore, database analysis reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LDHA and markers associated with ILC2s and the association of high expression of IL33 and an eosinophil marker SIGLEC8 with better overall survival in human cutaneous melanoma patients. This work demonstrates that the balance between the IL-33/ILC2/eosinophil axis and lactate production by tumor cells regulates melanoma growth."	0
"31924447"	"Directed RNase H Cleavage of Nascent Transcripts Causes Transcription Termination.An attractive approach to reduce gene expression is via the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that harness the RNase H1 mechanism. Here we show that RNase H ASOs targeted to introns or exons robustly reduce the level of spliced RNA associated with chromatin. Surprisingly, intron-targeted ASOs reduce the level of pre-mRNA associated with chromatin to a greater extent than exon-targeted ASOs. This indicates that exon-targeted ASOs achieve full activity after the pre-mRNA has undergone splicing, but before the mRNA is released from chromatin. Even though RNase H ASOs can reduce the level of RNA associated with chromatin, the effect of ASO-directed RNA degradation on transcription has never been documented. Here we show that intron-targeted ASOs and, to a lesser extent, exon-targeted ASOs cause RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination in cultured cells and mice. Furthermore, ASO-directed transcription termination is mediated by the nuclear exonuclease XRN2."	0
"32645367"	"A scoutRNA Is Required for Some Type V CRISPR-Cas Systems.CRISPR-Cas12c/d proteins share limited homology with Cas12a and Cas9 bacterial CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided nucleases used widely for genome editing and DNA detection. However, Cas12c (C2c3)- and Cas12d (CasY)-catalyzed DNA cleavage and genome editing activities have not been directly observed. We show here that a short-complementarity untranslated RNA (scoutRNA), together with crRNA, is required for Cas12d-catalyzed DNA cutting. The scoutRNA differs in secondary structure from previously described tracrRNAs used by CRISPR-Cas9 and some Cas12 enzymes, and in Cas12d-containing systems, scoutRNA includes a conserved five-nucleotide sequence that is essential for activity. In addition to supporting crRNA-directed DNA recognition, biochemical and cell-based experiments establish scoutRNA as an essential cofactor for Cas12c-catalyzed pre-crRNA maturation. These results define scoutRNA as a third type of transcript encoded by a subset of CRISPR-Cas genomic loci and explain how Cas12c/d systems avoid requirements for host factors including ribonuclease III for bacterial RNA-mediated adaptive immunity."	0

We report here that targeted loss of Id genes in adult ECs results in dilated, leaky sinusoids and a pro-inflammatory state that increases in severity over time. Disruption in sinusoidal integrity leads to increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, differentiation, migration, and exhaustion. Mechanistically, sinusoidal ECs (SECs) show increased apoptosis because of reduced Bcl2-family gene expression following Id gene ablation. Furthermore, Id1<sup>-/-</sup>Id3<sup>-/-</sup> SECs and upstream type H vessels show increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 and impaired ability to proliferate, which is rescued by reducing E2-2 expression. Id1<sup>-/-</sup>Id3<sup>-/-</sup> mice do not survive sublethal irradiation because of impaired vessel regeneration and hematopoietic failure. Thus, Id genes are required for the survival and regeneration of BM SECs during homeostasis and stress to maintain HSC development."	0
"32783930"	"RAI1 Regulates Activity-Dependent Nascent Transcription and Synaptic Scaling.Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as synaptic scaling are critically dependent on transcription. Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we use nascent RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional dynamics of primary neuron cultures undergoing network activity shifts. We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity."	0
"32049014"	"Hepatic DNAJB9 Drives Anabolic Biasing to Reduce Steatosis and Obesity.Nutrients stimulate the anabolic synthesis of proteins and lipids, but selective insulin resistance in obesity biases the anabolic program toward lipogenesis. Here, we report the identification of a DNAJB9-driven program that favors protein synthesis and energy production over lipid accumulation. We show there are two pools of DNAJB9 cochaperone. DNAJB9 in the ER lumen promotes the degradation of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1c through ERAD, whereas its counterpart on the ER membrane promotes the assembly of mTORC2 in the cytosol and stimulates the synthesis of proteins and ATP. The expression of Dnajb9 is induced by nutrients and downregulated in the obese mouse liver. Restoration of hepatic DNAJB9 expression effectively improves insulin sensitivity, restores protein synthesis, and suppresses food intake, accompanied by reduced hepatic steatosis and adiposity in multiple mouse models of obesity. Therefore, targeting the anabolic balance may provide a unique opportunity to tackle obesity and diabetes."	1
"31053472"	"Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Stimulated AMPK-Dependent Phosphorylation of Exo1 Protects Stressed Replication Forks from Aberrant Resection.Abnormal processing of stressed replication forks by nucleases can cause fork collapse, genomic instability, and cell death. Despite its importance, it is poorly understood how the cell properly controls nucleases to prevent detrimental fork processing. Here, we report a signaling pathway that controls the activity of exonuclease Exo1 to prevent aberrant fork resection during replication stress. Our results indicate that replication stress elevates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), leading to activation of CaMKK2 and the downstream kinase 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Following activation, AMPK directly phosphorylates Exo1 at serine 746 to promote 14-3-3 binding and inhibit Exo1 recruitment to stressed replication forks, thereby avoiding unscheduled fork resection. Disruption of this signaling pathway results in excessive ssDNA, chromosomal instability, and hypersensitivity to replication stress inducers. These findings reveal a link between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and the replication stress response as well as a function of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKK2-AMPK signaling axis in safeguarding fork structure to maintain genome stability."	1
"32727845"	"Identification of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain-directed human monoclonal antibody from a naïve semisynthetic library.There is a desperate need for safe and effective vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for SARS- coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), the development of which will be aided by the discovery of potent and selective antibodies against relevant viral epitopes. Human phage display technology has revolutionized the process of identifying and optimizing antibodies, providing facile entry points for further applications. Herein, we use this technology to search for antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2. Specifically, we screened a naïve human semisynthetic phage library against RBD, leading to the identification of a high-affinity single-chain fragment variable region (scFv). The scFv was further engineered into two other antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1). All three antibody formats showed high binding specificity to CoV-2 RBD and the spike antigens in different assay systems. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated specific binding of the IgG1 format to cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 spike protein. Docking studies revealed that the scFv recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-interacting sites on the CoV-2 RBD. Given its high specificity and affinity, we anticipate that these anti-CoV-2 antibodies will be useful as valuable reagents for accessing the antigenicity of vaccine candidates, as well as developing antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics for CoV-2."	0
"32541877"	"The protein kinase Akt acts as a coat adaptor in endocytic recycling.Coat proteins have a central role in vesicular transport by binding to cargoes for their sorting into intracellular pathways. Cargo recognition is mediated by components of the coat complex known as adaptor proteins<sup>1-3</sup>. We previously showed that Arf-GAP with coil-coil, ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1 (ACAP1) functions as an adaptor for a clathrin coat complex that has a function in endocytic recycling<sup>4-6</sup>. Here, we show that the protein kinase Akt acts as a co-adaptor in this complex, and is needed in conjunction with ACAP1 to bind to cargo proteins to promote their recycling. In addition to advancing the understanding of endocytic recycling, we uncover a fundamentally different function in which a kinase acts, as Akt in this case is an effector rather than a regulator in a cellular event."	1
"32668251"	"High Frequency of Shared Clonotypes in Human T Cell Receptor Repertoires.The collection of T cell receptors (TCRs) generated by somatic recombination is large but unknown. We generate large TCR repertoire datasets as a resource to facilitate detailed studies of the role of TCR clonotypes and repertoires in health and disease. We estimate the size of individual human recombined and expressed TCRs by sequence analysis and determine the extent of sharing between individual repertoires. Our experiments reveal that each blood sample contains between 5 million and 21 million TCR clonotypes. Three individuals share 8% of TCRβ- or 11% of TCRα-chain clonotypes. Sorting by T cell phenotypes in four individuals shows that 5% of naive CD4+ and 3.5% of naive CD8+ subsets share their TCRβ clonotypes, whereas memory CD4+ and CD8+ subsets share 2.3% and 0.4% of their clonotypes, respectively.

"32367047"	"Myeloid PTEN promotes chemotherapy-induced NLRP3-inflammasome activation and antitumour immunity.PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase that is frequently mutated in human cancer, and its deficiency in cancer has been associated with therapy resistance and poor survival. Although the intrinsic tumour-suppressor function of PTEN has been well established, evidence of its role in the tumour immune microenvironment is lacking. Here, we show that chemotherapy-induced antitumour immune responses and tumour suppression rely on myeloid-cell PTEN, which is essential for chemotherapy-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and antitumour immunity. PTEN directly interacts with and dephosphorylates NLRP3 to enable NLRP3-ASC interaction, inflammasome assembly and activation. Importantly, supplementation of IL-1β restores chemotherapy sensitivity in mouse myeloid cells with a PTEN deficiency. Clinically, chemotherapy-induced IL-1β production and antitumour immunity in patients with cancer is correlated with PTEN expression in myeloid cells, but not tumour cells. Our results demonstrate that myeloid PTEN can determine chemotherapy responsiveness by promoting NLRP3-dependent antitumour immunity and suggest that myeloid PTEN might be a potential biomarker to predict chemotherapy responses."	1

PARP1 and PARP2 are crucial for adipocyte differentiation, including the commitment toward white, brown, or beige adipose tissue lineages, as well as the regulation of lipid accumulation. Through regulating adipocyte function and organismal energy balance, PARPs play a role in obesity and the consequences of obesity.

"31051140"	"A Secreted RNA Binding Protein Forms RNA-Stabilizing Granules in the Honeybee Royal Jelly.RNA flow between organisms has been documented within and among different kingdoms of life. Recently, we demonstrated horizontal RNA transfer between honeybees involving secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. However, how the jelly facilitates transfer of RNA is still unknown. Here, we show that worker and royal jellies harbor robust RNA-binding activity. We report that a highly abundant jelly component, major royal jelly protein 3 (MRJP-3), acts as an extracellular non-sequence-specific RNA-aggregating factor. Multivalent RNA binding stimulates higher-order assembly of MRJP-3 into extracellular ribonucleoprotein granules that protect RNA from degradation and enhance RNA bioavailability. These findings reveal that honeybees have evolved a secreted dietary RNA-binding factor to concentrate, stabilize, and share RNA among individuals. Our work identifies high-order ribonucleoprotein assemblies with functions outside cells and organisms."	0

Here, we characterize the regulatory landscape of phosphorylation-based signaling events across the life cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine its impact on the regulation of lipid metabolism. Our data show that 50 lipid metabolic proteins are differentially phosphorylated as cells transit between different physiological states. To identify functional phosphosites, we devised a strategy where multiple phosphosites are simultaneously mutated into phosphomimetic or phosphodeficient alleles and mutants are phenotyped by in-depth lipidomics flux analysis. This uncovers functional phosphosites in the phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase Cds1, the phosphatidylserine synthase Cho1, and Fas2, the α-subunit of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex. Furthermore, we show that the fatty acyl chain length produced by FAS is governed by phosphorylation. Overall, our work demonstrates a vital role for phosphoregulation of lipid metabolism and provides a resource to investigate its molecular underpinnings."	0
"32846135"	"Landscape of Exhausted Virus-Specific CD8 T Cells in Chronic LCMV Infection.A hallmark of chronic infections is the presence of exhausted CD8 T cells, characterized by a distinct transcriptional program compared with functional effector or memory cells, co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, and impaired effector function, mainly driven by recurrent T cell receptor engagement. In the context of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, most studies focused on studying splenic virus-specific CD8 T cells. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of exhausted CD8 T cells isolated from six different tissues during established LCMV infection, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Our data reveal that exhausted cells are heterogeneous, adopt organ-specific transcriptomic profiles, and can be divided into five main functional subpopulations: advanced exhaustion, effector-like, intermediate, proliferating, or memory-like. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that these phenotypes are plastic, suggesting that the tissue microenvironment has a major impact in shaping the phenotype and function of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic infection."	0
"30686591"	"Genetic Screens Reveal FEN1 and APEX2 as BRCA2 Synthetic Lethal Targets.BRCA1 or BRCA2 inactivation drives breast and ovarian cancer but also creates vulnerability to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. To search for additional targets whose inhibition is synthetically lethal in BRCA2-deficient backgrounds, we screened two pairs of BRCA2 isogenic cell lines with DNA-repair-focused small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based libraries. We found that BRCA2-deficient cells are selectively dependent on multiple pathways including base excision repair, ATR signaling, and splicing. We identified APEX2 and FEN1 as synthetic lethal genes with both BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss of function. BRCA2-deficient cells require the apurinic endonuclease activity and the PCNA-binding domain of Ape2 (APEX2), but not Ape1 (APEX1). Furthermore, BRCA2-deficient cells require the 5' flap endonuclease but not the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Fen1, and chemically inhibiting Fen1 selectively targets BRCA-deficient cells. Finally, we developed a microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) reporter and showed that Fen1 participates in MMEJ, underscoring the importance of MMEJ as a collateral repair pathway in the context of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency."	0

Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 are associated with autoimmune diseases, suggesting a role in tissue inflammation. While the role of A20 in peripheral immune cells has been well investigated, less is known about its role in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that microglial A20 is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis. Without microglial A20, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells spontaneously infiltrate the CNS and acquire a viral response signature. The combination of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and activated A20-deficient microglia leads to an increase in VGLUT1<sup>+</sup> terminals and frequency of spontaneous excitatory currents.

To address these issues, we perform a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of aging, ischemic stroke, and their interaction in 3- and 18-month-old mice. We assess differential gene expression across injury status and age, estimate cell type proportion changes, assay the results against a range of transcriptional signatures from the literature, and perform unsupervised co-expression analysis, identifying modules of genes with varying response to injury. We uncover downregulation of axonal and synaptic maintenance genetic program, and increased activation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling following stroke in aged mice.

We use single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to visualize seven intermediates containing Escherichia coli RNAP with the transcription factor TraR en route to forming RPo. The structures span the RPo formation pathway from initial recognition of the duplex promoter in a closed complex to the final RPo. The structures and supporting biochemical data define RNAP and promoter DNA conformational changes that delineate steps on the pathway, including previously undetected transient promoter-RNAP interactions that contribute to populating the intermediates but do not occur in RPo. Our work provides a structural basis for understanding RPo formation and its regulation, a major checkpoint in gene expression throughout evolution."	0

However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions. Use of COPI provides effective prediction of gene activation potential and, more importantly, reveals a few developmental factors essential for mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation."	0

The molecular mechanisms that contain MN somata within the spinal cord while allowing their axons to exit the CNS and navigate to their final destinations remain incompletely understood. We find that the MN cell surface protein TAG-1 anchors MN cell bodies in the spinal cord to prevent their emigration, mediates motor axon fasciculation during CNS exit, and guides motor axons past dorsal root ganglia. TAG-1 executes these varied functions in MN development independently of one another. Our results identify TAG-1 as a key multifunctional regulator of MN wiring that coordinates neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance."	0

However, our present study shows that TA and EGCG do not inhibit the phospholipid-scrambling or ion conduction activities of the dual-functional TMEM16F. Instead, we found that TA and EGCG mainly acted as fluorescence quenchers that rapidly suppress the fluorophores conjugated to annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-binding probe commonly used to report on TMEM16 CaPLSase activity. These data demonstrate the false positive effects of TA and EGCG on inhibiting TMEM16F phospholipid scrambling and discourage the use of these polyphenols as CaPLSase inhibitors.

Despite this knowledge, most biomedical studies use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 12 weeks, raising concerns about reproducibility and potential masking of relevant age differences. Here, using mouse behavior and electrophysiology in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we reveal a decline in behavioral cutaneous touch sensitivity and Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction in vitro during mouse maturation but not thereafter. In addition, we identify distinct transcript changes in individual Piezo2-expressing mechanosensitive DRG neurons by combining electrophysiology with single-cell RNA sequencing (patch-seq).

We found that the differential response is attributable to the lack of expression of the adaptor protein TIRAP in naive T cells. TIRAP expression is induced upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and sustained by strong interleukin-2 (IL-2) signals. Expression of TIRAP requires TCR- and IL-2-induced mTORC1 activation. TLR2 stimulation induced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and ERK, leading to much higher production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by T helper 1 (Th1) cells cultured in a high concentration of IL-2 than by those cultured in a low concentration of IL-2. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation induces mTORC1 activation through TIRAP, which is essential for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production. These data demonstrate that the mTORC1 signal confers the response to TLR2 signaling by inducing TIRAP expression and that the TIRAP-mTORC1 axis is critical for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production by effector T cells."	1

Here, we provide an overview of how enhancers and promoters construct regulatory landscapes and how multiple scales of 3D chromatin structure sculpt their communication. We focus on emerging views of what enhancer-promoter contacts and chromatin domains physically represent and how two antagonistic fundamental forces-loop extrusion and homotypic attraction-likely form them. We also examine how these same forces spatially separate regulatory landscapes by functional state, thereby creating higher-order compartments that reconfigure during development to enable proper enhancer-promoter communication."	0

We characterized a Salmonella T6SS antibacterial effector called Tlde1 that is toxic in target-cell periplasm and is neutralized by its cognate immunity protein (Tldi1). Microscopy analysis reveals that cells expressing Tlde1 stop dividing and lose cell envelope integrity. Bioinformatic analysis uncovers similarities between Tlde1 and the catalytic domain of l,d-transpeptidases. Point mutations on conserved catalytic residues abrogate toxicity. Biochemical assays reveal that Tlde1 displays both l,d-carboxypeptidase activity by cleaving peptidoglycan tetrapeptides between meso-diaminopimelic acid<sup>3</sup> and d-alanine<sup>4</sup> and l,d-transpeptidase exchange activity by replacing d-alanine<sup>4</sup> by a non-canonical d-amino acid.

The Ski complex can engage productively with mRNA and extract it from 80S complexes containing as few as 19 (but not 13) 3'-terminal mRNA nucleotides starting from the P site. The mRNA-extracting activity of the Ski complex suggests that its role in mRNA quality control pathways is not limited to acceleration of exosomal degradation and could include clearance of stalled ribosomes from mRNA, poising mRNA for degradation and rendering stalled ribosomes recyclable by Pelota/Hbs1/ABCE1."	0
"32160544"	"Glioblastoma Cell Resistance to EGFR and MET Inhibition Can Be Overcome via Blockade of FGFR-SPRY2 Bypass Signaling.SPRY2 is a purported tumor suppressor in certain cancers that promotes tumor growth and resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in glioblastoma. Here, we identify a SPRY2-dependent bypass signaling mechanism in glioblastoma that drives resistance to EGFR and MET inhibition. In glioblastoma cells treated with EGFR and MET inhibitors, SPRY2 expression is initially suppressed but eventually rebounds due to NF-κB pathway activation, resultant autocrine FGFR activation, and reactivation of ERK, which controls SPRY2 transcription. In cells where FGFR autocrine signaling does not occur and ERK does not reactivate, or in which ERK reactivates but SPRY2 cannot be expressed, EGFR and MET inhibitors are more effective at promoting death. The same mechanism also drives acquired resistance to EGFR and MET inhibition. Furthermore, tumor xenografts expressing an ERK-dependent bioluminescent reporter engineered for these studies reveal that this bypass resistance mechanism plays out in vivo but can be overcome through simultaneous FGFR inhibition."	1

The small ∼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ∼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic."	0
"32023455"	"Loss of Human TGS1 Hypermethylase Promotes Increased Telomerase RNA and Telomere Elongation.Biogenesis of the human telomerase RNA (hTR) involves a complex series of posttranscriptional modifications, including hypermethylation of the 5' mono-methylguanosine cap to a tri-methylguanosine cap (TMG). How the TMG cap affects hTR maturation is unknown. Here, we show that depletion of trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), the enzyme responsible for cap hypermethylation, increases levels of hTR and telomerase. Diminished trimethylation increases hTR association with the cap-binding complex (CBC) and with Sm chaperone proteins. Loss of TGS1 causes an increase in accumulation of mature hTR in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm compared with controls. In TGS1 mutant cells, increased hTR assembles with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein to yield elevated active telomerase complexes and increased telomerase activity, resulting in telomere elongation in cultured human cells. Our results show that TGS1-mediated hypermethylation of the hTR cap inhibits hTR accumulation, restrains levels of assembled telomerase, and limits telomere elongation."	0

A group of proteins associate in a JQ1-sensitive manner with BET BRDs through canonical and new binding modes, while two classes of extra-terminal (ET)-domain binding motifs mediate acetylation-independent interactions. Last, we identify an unexpected increase in several interactions following JQ1 treatment that define negative functions for BRD3 in the regulation of rRNA synthesis and potentially RNAPII-dependent gene expression that result in decreased cell proliferation. Together, our data highlight the contributions of BET protein modules to their interactomes allowing for a better understanding of pharmacological rewiring in response to JQ1."	0

Using Cre recombinases labeling distinct vascular lineages, we conduct parallel lineage tracing experiments to assess their degree of contribution to de novo adipogenesis. Although we detect occasional adipocytes that were lineage traced by endothelial or mural recombinases, these are rare events. On the other hand, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα)-expressing adventitial or capsular fibroblasts make a significant contribution to adipocytes in all depots and experimental settings tested. Our data also suggest that fibroblasts transition to an intermediate beige adipocyte phenotype prior to differentiating to a mature white adipocyte. These observations, together with histological analyses revealing that adipose tissue fibroblasts express the mural cell marker PDGFRβ, harmonize a highly controversial field with implications for multiple human diseases, including the pandemic of obesity."	0
"32193353"	"Autophagy promotes mammalian survival by suppressing oxidative stress and p53.Autophagy captures intracellular components and delivers them to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Conditional autophagy deficiency in adult mice causes liver damage, shortens life span to 3 mo due to neurodegeneration, and is lethal upon fasting. As autophagy deficiency causes p53 induction and cell death in neurons, we sought to test whether p53 mediates the lethal consequences of autophagy deficiency. Here, we conditionally deleted <i>Trp53</i> (<i>p53</i> hereafter) and/or the essential autophagy gene <i>Atg7</i> throughout adult mice. Compared with Atg7 mice, the life span of Atg7 p53 mice was extended due to delayed neurodegeneration and resistance to death upon fasting. <i>Atg7</i> also suppressed apoptosis induced by p53 activator Nutlin-3, suggesting that autophagy inhibited p53 activation. To test whether increased oxidative stress in Atg7 mice was responsible for p53 activation, Atg7 was deleted in the presence or absence of the master regulator of antioxidant defense nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (<i>Nrf2</i>). <i>Nrf2 Atg7 mice died rapidly due to small intestine damage, which was not rescued by <i>p53</i> codeletion. Thus, <i>Atg7</i> limits p53 activation and p53-mediated neurodegeneration. In turn, NRF2 mitigates lethal intestine degeneration upon autophagy loss. These findings illustrate the tissue-specific roles for autophagy and functional dependencies on the p53 and NRF2 stress response mechanisms."	0
"31494034"	"Decreased Enhancer-Promoter Proximity Accompanying Enhancer Activation.Enhancers can regulate the promoters of their target genes over very large genomic distances. It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action involve the reorganization of three-dimensional chromatin architecture, but this is poorly understood. The predominant model involves physical enhancer-promoter interaction by looping out the intervening chromatin. However, studying the enhancer-driven activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene (Shh), we have identified a change in chromosome conformation that is incompatible with this simple looping model. Using super-resolution 3D-FISH and chromosome conformation capture, we observe a decreased spatial proximity between Shh and its enhancers during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors. We show that this can be recapitulated by synthetic enhancer activation, is impeded by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and the promoter, and appears to involve the catalytic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our data suggest that models of enhancer-promoter communication need to encompass chromatin conformations other than looping."	0

"31919189"	"Upon microbial challenge, human neutrophils undergo rapid changes in nuclear architecture and chromatin folding to orchestrate an immediate inflammatory gene program.Differentiating neutrophils undergo large-scale changes in nuclear morphology. How such alterations in structure are established and modulated upon exposure to microbial agents is largely unknown. Here, we found that prior to encounter with bacteria, an armamentarium of inflammatory genes was positioned in a transcriptionally passive environment suppressing premature transcriptional activation. Upon microbial exposure, however, human neutrophils rapidly (<3 h) repositioned the ensemble of proinflammatory genes toward the transcriptionally permissive compartment. We show that the repositioning of genes was closely associated with the swift recruitment of cohesin across the inflammatory enhancer landscape, permitting an immediate transcriptional response upon bacterial exposure. We found that activated enhancers, marked by increased deposition of H3K27Ac, were highly enriched for cistromic elements associated with PU.1, CEBPB, TFE3, JUN, and FOSL2 occupancy. These data reveal how upon microbial challenge the cohesin machinery is recruited to an activated enhancer repertoire to instruct changes in chromatin folding, nuclear architecture, and to activate an inflammatory gene program."	0
"32905771"	"No Evidence that Wnt Ligands Are Required for Planar Cell Polarity in Drosophila.The frizzled (fz) and dishevelled (dsh) genes are highly conserved members of both the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. Given these dual functions, several studies have examined whether Wnt ligands provide a tissue-scale orientation cue for PCP establishment during development, and these studies have reached differing conclusions. Here, we re-examine this issue in the Drosophila melanogaster wing and notum using split-Gal4 co-expression analysis, multiplex somatic CRISPR, and double RNAi experiments. Pairwise loss-of-function experiments targeting wg together with other Wnt genes, via somatic CRISPR or RNAi, do not produce PCP defects in the wing or notum. In addition, somatic CRISPR against evi (aka wntless), which is required for the secretion of Wnt ligands, did not produce detectable PCP phenotypes. Altogether, our results do not support the hypothesis that Wnt ligands contribute to PCP signaling in the Drosophila wing or notum."	0
"32877643"	"Molecular Connectivity of Mitochondrial Gene Expression and OXPHOS Biogenesis.Mitochondria contain their own gene expression systems, including membrane-bound ribosomes dedicated to synthesizing a few hydrophobic subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. We used a proximity-dependent biotinylation technique, BioID, coupled with mass spectrometry to delineate in baker's yeast a comprehensive network of factors involved in biogenesis of mitochondrial encoded proteins. This mitochondrial gene expression network (MiGENet) encompasses proteins involved in transcription, RNA processing, translation, or protein biogenesis. Our analyses indicate the spatial organization of these processes, thereby revealing basic mechanistic principles and the proteins populating strategically important sites. For example, newly synthesized proteins are directly handed over to ribosomal tunnel exit-bound factors that mediate membrane insertion, co-factor acquisition, or their mounting into OXPHOS complexes in a special early assembly hub. Collectively, the data reveal the connectivity of mitochondrial gene expression, reflecting a unique tailoring of the mitochondrial gene expression system."	0

Renal regeneration is also thought to be stimulated by the activation of Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells. However, whether and how the activation mechanisms underlying EV treatment and Sox9<sup>+</sup> cell-dependent regeneration intersect is unclear. We reasoned that a high-resolution imaging platform in living animals could help to untangle this system. To test this idea, we first applied EVs derived from human placenta-derived MSCs (hP-MSCs) to a Sox9-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; R26<sup>mTmG</sup> transgenic mouse model of acute kidney injury (AKI). Then, we developed an abdominal imaging window in the mouse and tracked the Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells in the inducible Sox9-Cre transgenic mice via <i>in vivo</i> lineage tracing with two-photon intravital microscopy. Our results demonstrated that EVs can travel to the injured kidneys post intravenous injection as visualized by Gaussia luciferase imaging and markedly increase the activation of Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells. Moreover, the two-photon living imaging of lineage-labeled Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells showed that the EVs promoted the expansion of Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells in kidneys post AKI. Histological staining results confirmed that the descendants of Sox9<sup>+</sup> cells contributed to nephric tubule regeneration which significantly ameliorated the renal function after AKI. In summary, intravital lineage tracing with two-photon microscopy through an embedded abdominal imaging window provides a practical strategy to investigate the beneficial functions and to clarify the mechanisms of regenerative therapies in AKI."	0

We identify two MBC subsets in peripheral blood, CD27<sup>dull</sup> and CD27<sup>bright</sup> MBCs, whose frequency changes with age. Heavy chain variable region (VH) usage, somatic mutation frequency replacement-to-silent ratio, and CDR3 property changes, reflecting consecutive selection of highly antigen-specific, low cross-reactive antibody variants, all demonstrate that CD27<sup>dull</sup> and CD27<sup>bright</sup> MBCs represent sequential MBC developmental stages, and stringent antigen-driven pressure selects CD27<sup>dull</sup> into the CD27<sup>bright</sup> MBC pool.

"32075757"	"A Dynamic Folded Hairpin Conformation Is Associated with α-Globin Activation in Erythroid Cells.We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the α-globin locus at the single-allele level in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and erythroid cells, combining polymer physics models and high-resolution Capture-C data. Model predictions are validated against independent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring pairwise distances, and Tri-C data identifying three-way contacts. The architecture is rearranged during the transition from ESCs to erythroid cells, associated with the activation of the globin genes. We find that in ESCs, the spatial organization conforms to a highly intermingled 3D structure involving non-specific contacts, whereas in erythroid cells the α-globin genes and their enhancers form a self-contained domain, arranged in a folded hairpin conformation, separated from intermingling flanking regions by a thermodynamic mechanism of micro-phase separation. The flanking regions are rich in convergent CTCF sites, which only marginally participate in the erythroid-specific gene-enhancer contacts, suggesting that beyond the interaction of CTCF sites, multiple molecular mechanisms cooperate to form an interacting domain."	0
"32521275"	"TBC1D5-Catalyzed Cycling of Rab7 Is Required for Retromer-Mediated Human Papillomavirus Trafficking during Virus Entry.During virus entry, human papillomaviruses are sorted by the cellular trafficking complex, called retromer, into the retrograde transport pathway to traffic from the endosome to downstream cellular compartments, but regulation of retromer activity during HPV entry is poorly understood. Here we selected artificial proteins that modulate cellular proteins required for HPV infection and discovered that entry requires TBC1D5, a retromer-associated, Rab7-specific GTPase-activating protein. Binding of retromer to the HPV L2 capsid protein recruits TBC1D5 to retromer at the endosome membrane, which then stimulates hydrolysis of Rab7-GTP to drive retromer disassembly from HPV and delivery of HPV to the retrograde pathway. Although the cellular retromer cargos CIMPR and DMT1-II require only GTP-bound Rab7 for trafficking, HPV trafficking requires cycling between GTP- and GDP-bound Rab7. Thus, ongoing cargo-induced membrane recruitment, assembly, and disassembly of retromer complexes drive HPV trafficking."	0
"31202576"	"Spatial Chromosome Folding and Active Transcription Drive DNA Fragility and Formation of Oncogenic MLL Translocations.How spatial chromosome organization influences genome integrity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) activities are enriched at chromatin loop anchors with high transcriptional activity. Recurrent DSBs occur at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin-bound sites at the bases of chromatin loops, and their frequency positively correlates with transcriptional output and directionality. The physiological relevance of this preferential positioning is indicated by the finding that genes recurrently translocating to drive leukemias are highly transcribed and are enriched at loop anchors. These genes accumulate DSBs at recurrent hotspots that give rise to chromosomal fusions relying on the activity of both TOP2 isoforms and on transcriptional elongation. We propose that transcription and 3D chromosome folding jointly pose a threat to genomic stability and are key contributors to the occurrence of genome rearrangements that drive cancer."	0
"32493771"	"Picornaviral polymerase domain exchanges reveal a modular basis for distinct biochemical activities of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.Picornaviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) have low replication fidelity that is essential for viral fitness and evolution. Their global fold consists of the classical ""cupped right hand"" structure with palm, fingers, and thumb domains, and these RdRPs also possess a unique contact between the fingers and thumb domains. This interaction restricts movements of the fingers, and RdRPs use a subtle conformational change within the palm domain to close their active sites for catalysis. We have previously shown that this core RdRP structure and mechanism provide a platform for polymerases to fine-tune replication rates and fidelity to optimize virus fitness. Here, we further elucidated the structural basis for differences in replication rates and fidelity among different viruses by generating chimeric RdRPs from poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3. We designed these chimeric polymerases by exchanging the fingers, pinky finger, or thumb domains. The results of biochemical, rapid-quench, and stopped-flow assays revealed that differences in biochemical activity map to individual modular domains of this polymerase. We found that the pinky finger subdomain is a major regulator of initiation and that the palm domain is the major determinant of catalytic rate and nucleotide discrimination. We further noted that thumb domain interactions with product RNA regulate translocation and that the palm and thumb domains coordinately control elongation complex stability. Several RdRP chimeras supported the growth of infectious poliovirus, providing insights into enterovirus species-specific protein-protein interactions required for virus replication."	0
"32610135"	"Zeb2 Is a Regulator of Astrogliosis and Functional Recovery after CNS Injury.The astrocytic response to injury is characterized on the cellular level, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the cellular processes is incomplete. The astrocytic response to injury is similar to wound-healing responses in non-neural tissues that involve epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) and upregulation in ZEB transcription factors. Here we show that injury-induced astrogliosis increases EMT-related genes expression, including Zeb2, and long non-coding RNAs, including Zeb2os, which facilitates ZEB2 protein translation. In mouse models of either contusive spinal cord injury or transient ischemic stroke, the conditional knockout of Zeb2 in astrocytes attenuates astrogliosis, generates larger lesions, and delays the recovery of motor function. These findings reveal ZEB2 as an important regulator of the astrocytic response to injury and suggest that astrogliosis is an EMT-like process, which provides a conceptual connection for the molecular and cellular similarities between astrogliosis and wound-healing responses in non-neural tissue."	0

To overcome this, we developed TARGET-seq, a method for the high-sensitivity detection of multiple mutations within single cells from both genomic and coding DNA, in parallel with unbiased whole-transcriptome analysis. Applying TARGET-seq to 4,559 single cells, we demonstrate how this technique uniquely resolves transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) stem and progenitor cells, providing insights into deregulated pathways of mutant and non-mutant cells.

To understand this mechanism, we utilize human Jurkat cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our results show that inhibition of HIV-1 infection caused by disrupting CypA-capsid interactions is dependent on human tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub>), showing that TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> restricts HIV-1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, depletion of TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rescues HIV-1 that fail to interact with CypA, such as HIV-1-P90A. We found that TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> binds to the HIV-1 core. Disruption of CypA-capsid interactions fail to affect HIV-1-A92E/G94D infection, correlating with the loss of TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> binding to HIV-1-A92E/G94D cores. Disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in primary cells has a greater inhibitory effect on HIV-1 when compared to Jurkat cells. Consistent with TRIM5α restriction, disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells inhibits reverse transcription. Overall, our results reveal that CypA binding to the core protects HIV-1 from TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> restriction."	0

We find that C-Raf binds all mutant Ras proteins with high affinity, whereas B-Raf exhibits a striking preference for mutant K-Ras. This selectivity is mediated by the acidic, N-terminal segment of B-Raf and requires the K-Ras polybasic region for high-affinity binding. In addition, we find that C-Raf is critical for mutant H-Ras-driven signaling and that events stabilizing B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization, such as Raf inhibitor treatment or certain B-Raf mutations, can allow mutant H-Ras to engage B-Raf with increased affinity to promote tumorigenesis, thus revealing a previously unappreciated role for C-Raf in potentiating B-Raf function."	1

Here, we identify an lncRNA, BDNF-AS, whose overexpression is specifically driven by a MEF2A-regulated enhancer in endocrine-resistant and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High levels of BDNF-AS in breast cancer tissues not only feature endocrine resistance in hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients but also correlate with poor outcomes in both HR-positive and TNBC patients. Mechanistically, BDNF-AS acts as a molecular scaffold to promote RNH1 protein degradation via TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of RNH1 at K225. Subsequently, BDNF-AS abolishes RNH1-regulated and RISC-mediated mTOR mRNA decay, therefore sustaining the activation of mTOR signaling. Importantly, mTOR inhibitor, but not PI3K inhibitor, could reverse tamoxifen resistance induced by the overexpression of BDNF-AS. These results point toward a master regulatory role of an enhancer-activated cascade of BDNF-AS/RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR in endocrine resistance and malignant progression of breast cancer."	1

We observe Fab binding to DENV (pH 8.0-5.0) prevents virus fusion, and the number of bound Fabs increase (from 120 to 180). For ZIKV, although there are already 180 copies of Fab at pH 8.0, virus structural changes at pH 5.0 are not inhibited. The immunoglobulin G (IgG):DENV structure at pH 8.0 shows both Fab arms bind to epitopes around the 2-fold vertex. On ZIKV, an additional Fab around the 5-fold vertex at pH 8.0 suggests one IgG arm would engage with an epitope, although the other may bind to other viruses, causing aggregation. For DENV2 at pH 5.0, a similar scenario would occur, suggesting DENV2:IgG complex would aggregate in the endosome.

SORL1-deficient hiPSC neurons show early endosome enlargement, a hallmark cytopathology of AD. There is no effect of SORL1 depletion on endosome size in hiPSC microglia, suggesting a selective effect on neuronal endosomal trafficking.

Inhibition of BACE does not rescue endosome enlargement in SORL1-deficient neurons, suggesting that this phenotype is independent of amyloidogenic APP processing.

Although many physiological signals, including glucocorticoid hormones, are pulsatile, the effects of transient stimulation on bursting are unknown. Here we characterize RNA synthesis from single-copy glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated transcription sites (TSs) under pulsed (ultradian) and constant hormone stimulation. In contrast to constant stimulation, pulsed stimulation induces restricted bursting centered around the hormonal pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that transcription factor (TF) nuclear mobility determines burst duration, whereas its bound fraction determines burst frequency. Using 3D tracking of TSs, we directly correlate TF binding and RNA synthesis at a specific promoter. Finally, we uncover a striking co-bursting pattern between TSs located at proximal and distal positions in the nucleus. Together, our data reveal a dynamic interplay between TF mobility and RNA bursting that is responsive to stimuli strength, type, modality, and duration."	0

We report that AMPA receptor auxiliary subunit GSG1L controls short-term plasticity in AT synapses that receive inputs from the cortex, but not in those receiving inputs from other pathways. A canonical auxiliary subunit stargazin co-exists in these neurons but is functionally absent from corticothalamic synapses.

"32169162"	"Mec1 Is Activated at the Onset of Normal S Phase by Low-dNTP Pools Impeding DNA Replication.The Mec1 and Rad53 kinases play a central role during acute replication stress in budding yeast. They are also essential for viability in normal growth conditions, but the signal that activates the Mec1-Rad53 pathway in the absence of exogenous insults is currently unknown. Here, we show that this pathway is active at the onset of normal S phase because deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels present in G<sub>1</sub> phase may not be sufficient to support processive DNA synthesis and impede DNA replication. This activation can be suppressed experimentally by increasing dNTP levels in G<sub>1</sub> phase. Moreover, we show that unchallenged cells entering S phase in the absence of Rad53 undergo irreversible fork collapse and mitotic catastrophe. Together, these data indicate that cells use suboptimal dNTP pools to detect the onset of DNA replication and activate the Mec1-Rad53 pathway, which in turn maintains functional forks and triggers dNTP synthesis, allowing the completion of DNA replication."	0

The class I HDAC, HDAC3, is of particular interest because it plays divergent roles in different tissues by partnering with tissue-specific transcription factors. We found that HDAC3 is expressed broadly in embryonic epidermis and is required for its orderly stepwise stratification. HDAC3 protein stability in vivo relies on NCoR and SMRT, which function redundantly in epidermal development. However, point mutations in the NCoR and SMRT deacetylase-activating domains, which are required for HDAC3's enzymatic function, permit normal stratification, indicating that HDAC3's roles in this context are largely independent of its histone deacetylase activity. HDAC3-bound sites are significantly enriched for predicted binding motifs for critical epidermal transcription factors including AP1, GRHL, and KLF family members. Our results suggest that among these, HDAC3 operates in conjunction with KLF4 to repress inappropriate expression of <i>Tgm1</i>, <i>Krt16</i>, and <i>Aqp3</i> In parallel, HDAC3 suppresses expression of inflammatory cytokines through a <i>Rela</i>-dependent mechanism. These data identify HDAC3 as a hub coordinating multiple aspects of epidermal barrier acquisition."	0

"31398322"	"Mutation Rate Heterogeneity Increases Odds of Survival in Unpredictable Environments.Mutation rates affect both a population's present fitness and its capacity to adapt to future environmental changes. When the available genetic variability limits adaptation to environmental change, natural selection favors high mutations rates. However, constitutively high mutation rates compromise the fitness of a population in stable environments. This problem may be resolved if an increase in mutation rates is limited to times of stress, restricted to some genomic regions, and occurs only in a subpopulation of cells. Such within-population heterogeneity of mutation rates can result from genetic, environmental, and stochastic effects. The presence of subpopulations of transient mutator cells does not jeopardize the overall fitness of a population under stable environmental conditions. However, they can increase the odds of survival in changing environments because they represent reservoirs of increased genetic variability. This article presents evidence that such heterogeneity of mutation rates is more the norm than the exception."	0
"31400849"	"Nascent Polypeptide Domain Topology and Elongation Rate Direct the Cotranslational Hierarchy of Hsp70 and TRiC/CCT.Cotranslational protein folding requires assistance from elaborate ribosome-associated chaperone networks. It remains unclear how the changing information in a growing nascent polypeptide dictates the recruitment of functionally distinct chaperones. Here, we used ribosome profiling to define the principles governing the cotranslational action of the chaperones TRiC/CCT and Hsp70/Ssb. We show that these chaperones are sequentially recruited to specific sites within domain-encoding regions of select nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 associates first, binding select sites throughout domains, whereas TRiC associates later, upon the emergence of nearly complete domains that expose an unprotected hydrophobic surface. This suggests that transient topological properties of nascent folding intermediates drive sequential chaperone association. Moreover, cotranslational recruitment of both TRiC and Hsp70 correlated with translation elongation slowdowns. We propose that the temporal modulation of the nascent chain structural landscape is coordinated with local elongation rates to regulate the hierarchical action of Hsp70 and TRiC for cotranslational folding."	0
"32294471"	"Transcription Dynamics Regulate Poly(A) Tails and Expression of the RNA Degradation Machinery to Balance mRNA Levels.Gene expression is regulated by the rates of synthesis and degradation of mRNAs, but how these processes are coordinated is poorly understood. Here, we show that reduced transcription dynamics of specific genes leads to enhanced m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, preferential activity of the CCR4-Not complex, shortened poly(A) tails, and reduced stability of the respective mRNAs. These effects are also exerted by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which we found to be transcriptional pause sites. However, when transcription dynamics, and subsequently poly(A) tails, are globally altered, cells buffer mRNA levels by adjusting the expression of mRNA degradation machinery. Stress-provoked global impediment of transcription elongation leads to a dramatic inhibition of the mRNA degradation machinery and massive mRNA stabilization. Accordingly, globally enhanced transcription, such as following B cell activation or glucose stimulation, has the opposite effects. This study uncovers two molecular pathways that maintain balanced gene expression in mammalian cells by linking transcription to mRNA stability."	0
"32905777"	"Hypoxia Triggers the Intravasation of Clustered Circulating Tumor Cells.Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from solid cancers in the form of single or clustered cells, and the latter display an extraordinary ability to initiate metastasis. Yet, the biological phenomena that trigger the shedding of CTC clusters from a primary cancerous lesion are poorly understood. Here, when dynamically labeling breast cancer cells along cancer progression, we observe that the majority of CTC clusters are undergoing hypoxia, while single CTCs are largely normoxic. Strikingly, we find that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting leads to primary tumor shrinkage, but it increases intra-tumor hypoxia, resulting in a higher CTC cluster shedding rate and metastasis formation. Conversely, pro-angiogenic treatment increases primary tumor size, yet it dramatically suppresses the formation of CTC clusters and metastasis. Thus, intra-tumor hypoxia leads to the formation of clustered CTCs with high metastatic ability, and a pro-angiogenic therapy suppresses metastasis formation through prevention of CTC cluster generation."	0

Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry indicated that, in fibroblasts, CARMIL1 associates with interleukin (IL)-1 signaling molecules. Immunoprecipitation of cells transfected with CARMIL1 mutants showed that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of CARMIL1 associates with IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Knockout of CARMIL1 by CRISPR-Cas9 reduced IL-1-induced ERK activation by 72% and MMP3 expression by 40%. Compared with CARMIL1 wild-type (WT), cells expressing mutant CARMIL1 lacking its LRR domain exhibited 45% lower ERK activation and 40% lower MMP3 expression. In fibroblasts transduced with a cell-permeable, TAT CARMIL1 peptide that competed with IL-1R1 and IRAK binding to the LRR of CARMIL1, collagen degradation was reduced by 43%. As the LRR of CARMIL1 evidently regulates IL-1 signaling, CARMIL1 could become a target for anti-inflammatory drug development."	1

Bacteriophages have in turn evolved inhibitory ""anti-CRISPR"" (Acr) proteins, including six inhibitors (AcrIIA1-AcrIIA6) that can block DNA cutting and genome editing by type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes.

Cryo-EM-determined structures of AcrIIA2 or AcrIIA2b bound to S. pyogenes Cas9 reveal a mode of competitive inhibition of DNA binding that is distinct from other known Acrs. Differences in the temperature dependence of Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA2b arise from differences in both inhibitor structure and the local inhibitor-binding environment on Cas9.

We have previously generated a transgenic mouse model that allows diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced ablation of Six2-positive nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Elimination of existing native host NPCs enables their replacement with donor NPCs, which can generate neo-nephrons. However, this system cannot be applied to human NPCs, because DT induces apoptosis in human cells. Therefore, the present study presents a transgenic mouse model for the ablation of NPCs using tamoxifen, which does not affect human cells. Using this system, we successfully regenerate interspecies neo-nephrons, which exhibit urine-producing abilities, from transplanted rat NPCs in a mouse host. Transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs results in differentiation into renal vesicles, which connect to the ureteric bud of the host. Thus, we demonstrate the possibility of the regeneration of human kidneys derived from human iPSC-derived NPCs via NPC replacement."	0

MYCN amplification and 1p36 deletions tightly correlate with markers of tumor aggressiveness in NBL. Although distal 1p36 losses associate with single-copy MYCN tumors, larger deletions correlate with MYCN amplification, indicating two tumor suppressor regions in 1p36, only one of which facilitates MYCN oncogenesis. To better define this region, we genome-edited the syntenic 1p36 locus in primary mouse neural crest cells (NCCs), a putative NBL cell of origin. In in vitro cell transformation assays, we show that Chd5 loss confers most of the MYCN-independent tumor suppressor effects of 1p36 LOH. In contrast, MYCN-driven tumorigenesis selects for NCCs with Arid1a deletions from a pool of NCCs with randomly sized 1p36 deletions, establishing Arid1a as the MYCN-associated tumor suppressor. Our findings reveal that Arid1a loss collaborates with oncogenic MYCN and better define the tumor suppressor functions of 1p36 LOH in NBL."	0

To uncover additional functions of Cdk1, we generated knockin mice expressing an analog-sensitive version of Cdk1 in place of wild-type Cdk1. In our study, we focused on embryonic stem cells (ESCs), because this cell type displays particularly high Cdk1 activity. We found that in ESCs, a large fraction of Cdk1 substrates is localized on chromatin. Cdk1 phosphorylates many proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, including writers and erasers of all major histone marks. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of Cdk1 altered histone-modification status of ESCs. High levels of Cdk1 in ESCs phosphorylate and partially inactivate Dot1l, the H3K79 methyltransferase responsible for placing activating marks on gene bodies. Decrease of Cdk1 activity during ESC differentiation de-represses Dot1l, thereby allowing coordinated expression of differentiation genes. These analyses indicate that Cdk1 functions to maintain the epigenetic identity of ESCs."	1
"32243828"	"Chromatin Hyperacetylation Impacts Chromosome Folding by Forming a Nuclear Subcompartment.Delineating how chromosomes fold at length scales beyond one megabase remains obscure relative to smaller-scale folding into TADs, loops, and nucleosomes. We find that rather than simply unfolding chromatin, histone hyperacetylation results in interactions between distant genomic loci separated by tens to hundreds of megabases, even in the absence of transcription. These hyperacetylated ""megadomains"" are formed by the BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein, interact both within and between chromosomes, and form a specific nuclear subcompartment that has elevated gene activity with respect to other subcompartments. Pharmacological degradation of BRD4-NUT results in collapse of megadomains and attenuation of the interactions between them. In contrast, these interactions persist and contacts between newly acetylated regions are formed after inhibiting RNA polymerase II initiation. Our structure-function approach thus reveals that broad chromatin domains of identical biochemical composition, independent of transcription, form nuclear subcompartments, and also indicates the potential of altering chromosome structure for treating human disease."	0
"31585693"	"A Diversity of Selective Autophagy Receptors Determines the Specificity of the Autophagy Pathway.The clearance of surplus, broken, or dangerous components is key for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The failure to remove protein aggregates, damaged organelles, or intracellular pathogens leads to diseases, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and infectious diseases. Autophagy is the evolutionarily conserved pathway that sequesters cytoplasmic components in specialized vesicles, autophagosomes, which transport the cargo to the degradative compartments (vacuoles or lysosomes). Research during the past few decades has elucidated how autophagosomes engulf their substrates selectively. This type of autophagy involves a growing number of selective autophagy receptors (SARs) (e.g., Atg19 in yeasts, p62/SQSTM1 in mammals), which bind to the cargo and simultaneously engage components of the core autophagic machinery via direct interaction with the ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) of the Atg8/LC3/GABARAP family and adaptors, Atg11 (in yeasts) or FIP200 (in mammals).

We found that the antibiotic retapamulin specifically arrests initiating ribosomes at start codons of the genes. Retapamulin-enhanced Ribo-seq analysis (Ribo-RET) not only allowed mapping of conventional initiation sites at the beginning of the genes, but strikingly, it also revealed putative internal start sites in a number of Escherichia coli genes. Experiments demonstrated that the internal start codons can be recognized by the ribosomes and direct translation initiation in vitro and in vivo.

"32126207"	"FBXL5 Regulates IRP2 Stability in Iron Homeostasis via an Oxygen-Responsive [2Fe2S] Cluster.Cellular iron homeostasis is dominated by FBXL5-mediated degradation of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), which is dependent on both iron and oxygen. However, how the physical interaction between FBXL5 and IRP2 is regulated remains elusive. Here, we show that the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of FBXL5 harbors a [2Fe2S] cluster in the oxidized state. A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the IRP2-FBXL5-SKP1 complex reveals that the cluster organizes the FBXL5 C-terminal loop responsible for recruiting IRP2. Interestingly, IRP2 binding to FBXL5 hinges on the oxidized state of the [2Fe2S] cluster maintained by ambient oxygen, which could explain hypoxia-induced IRP2 stabilization. Steric incompatibility also allows FBXL5 to physically dislodge IRP2 from iron-responsive element RNA to facilitate its turnover. Taken together, our studies have identified an iron-sulfur cluster within FBXL5, which promotes IRP2 polyubiquitination and degradation in response to both iron and oxygen concentrations."	0

In some humans, <i>hCYP11B2</i> undergoes a unique intron conversion whose function is largely unclear. The intron conversion is formed by a replacement of the segment of DNA within intron 2 of <i>hCYP11B2</i> with the corresponding region of the <i>hCYP11B1</i> gene. We show here that the intron conversion is located in an open chromatin form and binds more strongly to the transcriptional regulators histone acetyltransferase P300 (p300), NFκB, and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). Reporter constructs containing the intron conversion had increased promoter activity on transient transfection in H295R cells compared with WT intron 2. We generated humanized transgenic (TG) mice containing all the introns, exons, and 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of the <i>hCYP11B2</i> gene containing either the intron conversion or WT intron 2. We found that TG mice containing the intron conversion have (<i>a</i>) increased plasma aldosterone levels, (<i>b</i>) increased <i>hCYP11B2</i> mRNA and protein levels, and (<i>c</i>) increased blood pressure compared with TG mice containing WT intron 2. Results of a ChIP assay showed that chromatin obtained from the adrenals of TG mice containing the intron conversion binds more strongly to p300, NFκB, and CEBPα than to WT intron 2. These results uncover a functional role of intron conversion in <i>hCYP11B2</i> and suggest a new paradigm in blood pressure regulation."	0

This metabolism-epigenome link sensitizes chromatin methylation to altered SAM abundance, yet the mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt and protect epigenetic information during life-experienced fluctuations in SAM availability are unknown. We identified a robust response to SAM depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under SAM-depleted conditions, H3K9 mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to SAM depletion in vivo. Together, these studies provide evidence for an adaptive response that enables epigenetic persistence to metabolic stress."	0
"31995750"	"Cross-talk between CD38 and TTP Is Essential for Resolution of Inflammation during Microbial Sepsis.The resolution phase of acute inflammation is essential for tissue homeostasis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate that resolution of inflammation involves interactions between CD38 and tristetraprolin (TTP). During the onset of acute inflammation, CD38 levels are increased, leading to the production of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling messengers, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), ADP ribose (ADPR), and cyclic ADPR (cADPR) from NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>. To initiate the onset of resolution, TTP expression is increased by the second messengers, NAADP and cADPR, which downregulate CD38 expression. The activation of TTP by Sirt1-dependent deacetylation, in response to increased NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, suppresses the acute inflammatory response and decreases Rheb expression, inhibits mTORC1, and induces autophagolysosomes for bacterial clearance. TTP may represent a mechanistic target of anti-inflammatory agents, such as carbon monoxide.

"32320652"	"Rational Design of Allosteric and Selective Inhibitors of the Molecular Chaperone TRAP1.TRAP1 is the mitochondrial paralog of the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone family. Its activity as an energy metabolism regulator has important implications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemia. Selective inhibitors of TRAP1 could inform on its mechanisms of action and set the stage for targeted drug development, but their identification was hampered by the similarity among active sites in HSP90 homologs. We use a dynamics-based approach to identify a TRAP1 allosteric pocket distal to its active site that can host drug-like molecules, and we select small molecules with optimal stereochemical features to target the pocket. These leads inhibit TRAP1, but not HSP90, ATPase activity and revert TRAP1-dependent downregulation of succinate dehydrogenase activity in cancer cells and in zebrafish larvae. TRAP1 inhibitors are not toxic per se, but they abolish tumorigenic growth of neoplastic cells. Our results indicate that exploiting conformational dynamics can expand the chemical space of chaperone antagonists to TRAP1-specific inhibitors with wide therapeutic opportunities."	0
"30472189"	"Nucleosome Turnover Regulates Histone Methylation Patterns over the Genome.Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence."	0

We use recently developed enzymatic inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and human naive T lymphocyte activation as a model system to uncover a precise set of mRNA transcripts that require symmetric arginine dimethylation. This methylation-dependent splicing selectivity is associated with a limited set of signaling pathways that are affected when PRMT5 is inhibited.

Examination of these interactions using purified mitochondria and liposomes with full-length recombinant proteins revealed that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> inhibits apoptosis as a higher-order complex that binds multiple BH3 proteins. Allosteric regulation of this complex by the BH3 sensitizer Bad confers switch-like activity to the indirect activation of Bax. The BH3 activator cBid sequestered by Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> complexes changes from an inactive to an active form while bound to a Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> complex only when Bad is also bound.

Different genes exhibited substantially variable sensitivities, with depletion of NXF1 and TREX components causing some transcripts to become strongly retained in the nucleus while others were not affected. Specifically, NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U content, whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts.

Disrupting the interactions between canonical and non-canonical CSDs impacts RNA binding, Unr-mediated translation regulation, and the Unr-dependent RNA interactome.

A possible origin for the entorhinal speed signal is the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is critically involved in the activation of locomotor programs. Here, we describe, in rats, a circuit connecting the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) of the MLR to the MEC via the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB). At each level of this pathway, locomotion speed is linearly encoded in neuronal firing rates.

Recent studies implicate the metalloprotease SPRTN in S phase removal of DPCs, but how SPRTN is targeted to DPCs during DNA replication is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN and proteasome activities are coupled to DNA replication by distinct mechanisms that promote replication across immovable protein barriers."	0

Drugs targeting L- and other enteroendocrine cells are under development, with the aim to mimic endocrine effects of gastric bypass surgery, but they are difficult to develop without human L-cell models. Human ileal organoids, engineered by CRISPR-Cas9, express the fluorescent protein Venus in the proglucagon locus, enabling maintenance of live, identifiable human L-cells in culture. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified organoid-derived L-cells, analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), express hormones, receptors, and ion channels, largely typical of their murine counterparts. L-cells are electrically active and exhibit membrane depolarization and calcium elevations in response to G-protein-coupled receptor ligands. Organoids secrete hormones in response to glucose and other stimuli. The ability to label and maintain human L-cells in organoid culture opens avenues to explore L-cell function and develop drugs targeting the human enteroendocrine system."	0
"31995758"	"Tandem Paired Nicking Promotes Precise Genome Editing with Scarce Interference by p53.Targeted knockin mediated by double-stranded DNA cleavage is accompanied by unwanted insertions and deletions (indels) at on-target and off-target sites. A nick-mediated approach scarcely generates indels but exhibits reduced efficiency of targeted knockin. Here, we demonstrate that tandem paired nicking, a method for targeted knockin involving two Cas9 nickases that create nicks at the homologous regions of the donor DNA and the genome in the same strand, scarcely creates indels at the edited genomic loci, while permitting the efficiency of targeted knockin largely equivalent to that of the Cas9-nuclease-based approach. Tandem paired nicking seems to accomplish targeted knockin by DNA recombination analogous to Holliday's model and creates intended genomic changes without introducing additional nucleotide changes, such as silent mutations. Targeted knockin through tandem paired nicking neither triggers significant p53 activation nor occurs preferentially in p53-suppressed cells. These properties of tandem paired nicking demonstrate its utility in precision genome engineering."	0
"32049028"	"Opposing Regulation of Cocaine Seeking by Glutamate and GABA Neurons in the Ventral Pallidum.Projections from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum (VP) regulate relapse in animal models of addiction. The VP contains GABAergic (VP<sub>GABA</sub>) and glutamatergic (VP<sub>Glu</sub>) neurons, and a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons co-express enkephalin (VP<sub>Penk</sub>). Rabies tracing reveals that VP<sub>Glu</sub> and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons receive preferential innervation from upstream D1- relative to D2-expressing accumbens neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons inhibits, whereas stimulation of VP<sub>GABA</sub> and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons potentiates cocaine seeking in mice withdrawn from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Calcium imaging reveals cell type-specific activity patterns when animals learn to suppress drug seeking during extinction training versus engaging in cue-induced cocaine seeking. During cued seeking, VP<sub>GABA</sub> neurons increase their overall activity, and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons are selectively activated around nose pokes for cocaine. In contrast, VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons increase their spike rate following extinction training. These data show that VP subpopulations differentially encode and regulate cocaine seeking, with VP<sub>Penk</sub> and VP<sub>GABA</sub> neurons facilitating and VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons inhibiting cocaine seeking."	0
"31759823"	"A Conserved Noncoding Locus Regulates Random Monoallelic Xist Expression across a Topological Boundary.cis-Regulatory communication is crucial in mammalian development and is thought to be restricted by the spatial partitioning of the genome in topologically associating domains (TADs). Here, we discovered that the Xist locus is regulated by sequences in the neighboring TAD. In particular, the promoter of the noncoding RNA Linx (LinxP) acts as a long-range silencer and influences the choice of X chromosome to be inactivated. This is independent of Linx transcription and independent of any effect on Tsix, the antisense regulator of Xist that shares the same TAD as Linx. Unlike Tsix, LinxP is well conserved across mammals, suggesting an ancestral mechanism for random monoallelic Xist regulation. When introduced in the same TAD as Xist, LinxP switches from a silencer to an enhancer. Our study uncovers an unsuspected regulatory axis for X chromosome inactivation and a class of cis-regulatory effects that may exploit TAD partitioning to modulate developmental decisions."	0

"32521258"	"Rab7-Mediated Endocytosis Establishes Patterning of Wnt Activity through Inactivation of Dkk Antagonism.Endocytosis has been proposed to modulate cell signaling activities. However, the role of endocytosis in embryogenesis, which requires coordination of multiple signaling inputs, has remained less understood. We previously showed that mouse embryos lacking a small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein Rab7 implicated in endocytic flow are defective in gastrulation. Here, we investigate how subcellular defects associated with Rab7 deficiency are related to the observed developmental defects. Rab7-deficient embryos fail to organize mesodermal tissues due to defects in Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Visceral endoderm (VE)-specific ablation of Rab7 results in patterning defects similar to systemic Rab7 deletion. Rab7 mutants accumulate the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 in the extracellular space and in intracellular compartments throughout the VE epithelium. These data indicate that Rab7-dependent endocytosis regulates the concentration and availability of extracellular Dkk1, thereby relieving the epiblast of antagonism. This intercellular mechanism therefore organizes distinct spatiotemporal patterns of canonical Wnt activity during the peri-gastrulation stages of embryonic development."	0
"32783935"	"Runx2+ Niche Cells Maintain Incisor Mesenchymal Tissue Homeostasis through IGF Signaling.Stem cell niches provide a microenvironment to support the self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation of stem cells. Cell-cell interactions within the niche are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the niche cells supporting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show heterogeneity among Gli1+ MSCs and identify a subpopulation of Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult mouse incisor. These Runx2+/Gli1+ cells are strategically located between MSCs and transit-amplifying cells (TACs). They are not stem cells but help to maintain the MSC niche via IGF signaling to regulate TAC proliferation, differentiation, and incisor growth rate. ATAC-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation reveal that Runx2 directly binds to Igfbp3 in niche cells. This Runx2-mediated IGF signaling is crucial for regulating the MSC niche and maintaining tissue homeostasis to support continuous growth of the adult mouse incisor, providing a model for analysis of the molecular regulation of the MSC niche."	0
"30472188"	"OTUB2 Promotes Cancer Metastasis via Hippo-Independent Activation of YAP and TAZ.The transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ play important roles in development, physiology, and tumorigenesis and are negatively controlled by the Hippo pathway. It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ. Our results establish OTUB2 as an essential modulator of YAP/TAZ and also reveal a novel mechanism via which YAP/TAZ activity is induced by oncogenic KRAS."	1
"31919188"	"The chromatin remodeler Snf2h is essential for oocyte meiotic cell cycle progression.Oocytes are indispensable for mammalian life. Thus, it is important to understand how mature oocytes are generated. As a critical stage of oocytes development, meiosis has been extensively studied, yet how chromatin remodeling contributes to this process is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor Snf2h (also known as Smarca5) plays a critical role in regulating meiotic cell cycle progression. Females with oocyte-specific depletion of <i>Snf2h</i> are infertile and oocytes lacking <i>Snf2h</i> fail to undergo meiotic resumption. Mechanistically, depletion of <i>Snf2h</i> results in dysregulation of meiosis-related genes, which causes failure of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation. ATAC-seq analysis in oocytes revealed that Snf2h regulates transcription of key meiotic genes, such as <i>Prkar2b</i>, by increasing its promoter chromatin accessibility. Thus, our studies not only demonstrate the importance of Snf2h in oocyte meiotic resumption, but also reveal the mechanism underlying how a chromatin remodeling factor can regulate oocyte meiosis."	1

Numerical and computational methods for dimensionality reduction allow for low-dimensional representation of genome-scale expression data for downstream clustering, trajectory reconstruction, and biological interpretation. However, a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the performance of these techniques has not been established. We present an unbiased framework that defines metrics of global and local structure preservation in dimensionality reduction transformations. Using discrete and continuous real-world and synthetic scRNA-seq datasets, we show how input cell distribution and method parameters are largely determinant of global, local, and organizational data structure preservation by 11 common dimensionality reduction methods."	0

DnaB helicase is loaded onto unwound <i>oriC</i> via interactions with the DnaC loader and the DnaA complex. The DnaB-DnaC complex is recruited to the DnaA complex via stable binding of DnaB to DnaA domain I. The DnaB-DnaC complex is then directed to unwound <i>oriC</i> via a weak interaction between DnaB and DnaA domain III. Previously, we showed that Phe<sup>46</sup> in DnaA domain I binds to DnaB. Here, we searched for the DnaA domain I-binding site in DnaB. The DnaB L160A variant was impaired in binding to DnaA complex on <i>oriC</i> but retained its DnaC-binding and helicase activities. DnaC binding moderately stimulated DnaA binding of DnaB L160A, and loading of DnaB L160A onto <i>oriC</i> was consistently and moderately inhibited. In a helicase assay with partly single-stranded DNA bearing a DnaA-binding site, DnaA stimulated DnaB loading, which was strongly inhibited in DnaB L160A even in the presence of DnaC.

"31940481"	"T-bet+ Memory B Cells Link to Local Cross-Reactive IgG upon Human Rhinovirus Infection.Human rhinoviruses cause the common cold and exacerbate chronic respiratory diseases. Although infection elicits neutralizing antibodies, these do not persist or cross-protect across multiple rhinovirus strains. To analyze rhinovirus-specific B cell responses in humans, we developed techniques using intact RV-A16 and RV-A39 for high-throughput high-dimensional single-cell analysis, with parallel assessment of antibody isotypes in an experimental infection model. Our approach identified T-bet+ B cells binding both viruses that account for ∼5% of CXCR5- memory B cells. These B cells infiltrate nasal tissue and expand in the blood after infection. Their rapid secretion of heterotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vitro, but not IgA, matches the nasal antibody profile post-infection. By contrast, CXCR5+ memory B cells binding a single virus are clonally distinct, absent in nasal tissue, and secrete homotypic IgG and IgA, mirroring the systemic response. Temporal and spatial functions of dichotomous memory B cells might explain the ability to resolve infection while rendering the host susceptible to re-infection."	0
"32294437"	"BCR-Induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> Signals Dynamically Tune Survival, Metabolic Reprogramming, and Proliferation of Naive B Cells.B cell receptor (BCR) engagement induces naive B cells to differentiate and perform critical immune-regulatory functions. Acquisition of functional specificity requires that a cell survive, enter the cell cycle, and proliferate. We establish that quantitatively distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals triggered by variations in the extent of BCR engagement dynamically regulate these transitions by controlling nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), NFAT, and mTORC1 activity. Weak BCR engagement induces apoptosis by failing to activate NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic gene expression. Stronger signals that trigger more robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals promote NF-κB-dependent survival and NFAT-, mTORC1-, and c-Myc-dependent cell-cycle entry and proliferation. Finally, we establish that CD40 or TLR9 costimulation circumvents these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated checkpoints of B cell activation and proliferation. As altered BCR signaling is linked to autoimmunity and B cell malignancies, these results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of aberrant B cell activation and differentiation and therapeutic approaches to target these responses."	0

Herein, we demonstrate that fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) demethylates m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cyclin D1, the key regulator for G1 phase progression and controls cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. FTO depletion upregulates cyclin D1 m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which in turn accelerates the degradation of cyclin D1 mRNA, leading to the impairment of G1 progression. m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cyclin D1 oscillates in a cell-cycle-dependent manner; m<sup>6</sup>A levels are suppressed during the G1 phase and enhanced during other phases. Low m<sup>6</sup>A levels during G1 are associated with the nuclear translocation of FTO from the cytosol. Furthermore, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FTO is regulated by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of FTO. Our results highlight the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in regulating cyclin D1 mRNA stability and add another layer of complexity to cell-cycle regulation."	0
"32640233"	"Theta Oscillations Coincide with Sustained Hyperpolarization in CA3 Pyramidal Cells, Underlying Decreased Firing.Brain states modulate the membrane potential dynamics of neurons, influencing the functional repertoire of the network. Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, which preferentially occurs during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and a reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta, as observed in ensemble recordings."	0

"32023457"	"A P53-Independent DNA Damage Response Suppresses Oncogenic Proliferation and Genome Instability.The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is a DNA double-strand break sensor that mediates a tumor-suppressive DNA damage response (DDR) in cells undergoing oncogenic stress, yet the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. Using a genetically inducible primary mammary epithelial cell model, we demonstrate that Mre11 suppresses proliferation and DNA damage induced by diverse oncogenic drivers through a p53-independent mechanism. Breast tumorigenesis models engineered to express a hypomorphic Mre11 allele exhibit increased levels of oncogene-induced DNA damage, R-loop accumulation, and chromosomal instability with a characteristic copy number loss phenotype. Mre11 complex dysfunction is identified in a subset of human triple-negative breast cancers and is associated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapy and inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Thus, deficiencies in the Mre11-dependent DDR drive proliferation and genome instability patterns in p53-deficient breast cancers and represent an opportunity for therapeutic exploitation."	0
"32553165"	"Identification of a G-Protein-Independent Activator of GIRK Channels.G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels are essential effectors of inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. GIRK channels have been implicated in diseases with abnormal neuronal excitability, including epilepsy and addiction. GIRK channels are tetramers composed of either the same subunit (e.g., homotetramers) or different subunits (e.g., heterotetramers). Compounds that specifically target subsets of GIRK channels in vivo are lacking. Previous studies have shown that alcohol directly activates GIRK channels through a hydrophobic pocket located in the cytoplasmic domain of the channel. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a GIRK1-selective activator, termed GiGA1, that targets the alcohol pocket. GiGA1 activates GIRK1/GIRK2 both in vitro and in vivo and, in turn, mitigates the effects of a convulsant in an acute epilepsy mouse model. These results shed light on the structure-based development of subunit-specific GIRK modulators that could provide potential treatments for brain disorders."	0
"31585692"	"A Consensus Binding Motif for the PP4 Protein Phosphatase.Dynamic protein phosphorylation constitutes a fundamental regulatory mechanism in all organisms. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is a conserved and essential nuclear serine and threonine phosphatase. Despite the importance of PP4, general principles of substrate selection are unknown, hampering the study of signal regulation by this phosphatase. Here, we identify and thoroughly characterize a general PP4 consensus-binding motif, the FxxP motif. X-ray crystallography studies reveal that FxxP motifs bind to a conserved pocket in the PP4 regulatory subunit PPP4R3. Systems-wide in silico searches integrated with proteomic analysis of PP4 interacting proteins allow us to identify numerous FxxP motifs in proteins controlling a range of fundamental cellular processes. We identify an FxxP motif in the cohesin release factor WAPL and show that this regulates WAPL phosphorylation status and is required for efficient cohesin release. Collectively our work uncovers basic principles of PP4 specificity with broad implications for understanding phosphorylation-mediated signaling in cells."	0

However, it remains less clear if diet-dependent host signaling mechanisms also influence these associations. Using Drosophila, we show here that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/Relish, an innate immune transcription factor emerging as a signaling node linking nutrient-immune-metabolic interactions, is vital to adapt gut microbiota species composition to host diet macronutrient composition. We find that Relish is required within midgut enterocytes to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations, an important bacterial mediator of nutritional symbiosis, and thus modulate microbiota composition in response to dietary adaptation. Relish limits diet-dependent transcriptional inducibility of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4E-BP/Thor to control microbiota composition. Furthermore, maintaining cap-dependent translation in response to dietary adaptation is critical to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations. These results highlight that NF-κB-dependent host signaling mechanisms, in coordination with host translation control, shape diet-microbiota interactions."	0
"32698014"	"Tissue-Specific Regulation of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway by PAGE4 Inhibition of Tankyrase.Spatiotemporal control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critical for organism development and homeostasis. The poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase Tankyrase (TNKS1) promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling through PARylation-mediated degradation of AXIN1, a component of the β-catenin destruction complex. Although Wnt/β-catenin is a niche-restricted signaling program, tissue-specific factors that regulate TNKS1 are not known. Here, we report prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) as a tissue-specific TNKS1 inhibitor that robustly represses canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human cells, zebrafish, and mice. Structural and biochemical studies reveal that PAGE4 acts as an optimal substrate decoy that potently hijacks substrate binding sites on TNKS1 to prevent AXIN1 PARylation and degradation. Consistently, transgenic expression of PAGE4 in mice phenocopies TNKS1 knockout. Physiologically, PAGE4 is selectively expressed in stromal prostate fibroblasts and functions to establish a proper Wnt/β-catenin signaling niche through suppression of autocrine signaling. Our findings reveal a non-canonical mechanism for TNKS1 inhibition that functions to establish tissue-specific control of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."	1
"32554805"	"Protein docking and steered molecular dynamics suggest alternative phospholamban-binding sites on the SERCA calcium transporter.The transport activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) in cardiac myocytes is modulated by an inhibitory interaction with a transmembrane peptide, phospholamban (PLB). Previous biochemical studies have revealed that PLB interacts with a specific inhibitory site on SERCA, and low-resolution structural evidence suggests that PLB interacts with distinct alternative sites on SERCA. High-resolution details of the structural determinants of SERCA regulation have been elusive because of the dynamic nature of the regulatory complex. In this study, we used computational approaches to develop a structural model of SERCA-PLB interactions to gain a mechanistic understanding of PLB-mediated SERCA transport regulation. We combined steered molecular dynamics and membrane protein-protein docking experiments to achieve both a global search and all-atom force calculations to determine the relative affinities of PLB for candidate sites on SERCA. We modeled the binding of PLB to several SERCA conformations, representing different enzymatic states sampled during the calcium transport catalytic cycle. The results of the steered molecular dynamics and docking experiments indicated that the canonical PLB-binding site (comprising transmembrane helices M2, M4, and M9) is the preferred site. This preference was even more stringent for a superinhibitory PLB variant. Interestingly, PLB-binding specificity became more ambivalent for other SERCA conformers. These results provide evidence for polymorphic PLB interactions with novel sites on M3 and with the outside of the SERCA helix M9. Our findings are compatible with previous physical measurements that suggest that PLB interacts with multiple binding sites, conferring dynamic responsiveness to changing physiological conditions."	0

Mechanisms underlying nutrient modulation of ChREBP are under active investigation. Here we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as a previously unknown ChREBP-interacting protein that is enriched in liver biopsies of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Biochemical and genetic studies show that HCF-1 is O-GlcNAcylated in response to glucose as a prerequisite for its binding to ChREBP and subsequent recruitment of OGT, ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation, and activation. The HCF-1:ChREBP complex resides at lipogenic gene promoters, where HCF-1 regulates H3K4 trimethylation to prime recruitment of the Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylase PHF2 for epigenetic activation of these promoters. Overall, these findings define HCF-1's interaction with ChREBP as a previously unappreciated mechanism whereby glucose signals are both relayed to ChREBP and transmitted for epigenetic regulation of lipogenic genes."	1

"32386543"	"Large DNA Methylation Nadirs Anchor Chromatin Loops Maintaining Hematopoietic Stem Cell Identity.Higher-order chromatin structure and DNA methylation are implicated in multiple developmental processes, but their relationship to cell state is unknown. Here, we find that large (>7.3 kb) DNA methylation nadirs (termed ""grand canyons"") can form long loops connecting anchor loci that may be dozens of megabases (Mb) apart, as well as inter-chromosomal links. The interacting loci cover a total of ∼3.5 Mb of the human genome. The strongest interactions are associated with repressive marks made by the Polycomb complex and are diminished upon EZH2 inhibitor treatment. The data are suggestive of the formation of these loops by interactions between repressive elements in the loci, forming a genomic subcompartment, rather than by cohesion/CTCF-mediated extrusion. Interestingly, unlike previously characterized subcompartments, these interactions are present only in particular cell types, such as stem and progenitor cells.

We investigate whether β-glucan exposure confers protection against pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. β-glucan induces trained immunity via histone modifications at gene promoters in human monocytes, which is accompanied by the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines upon secondary Mtb challenge and inhibition of Mtb growth. Mice treated with β-glucan are significantly protected against pulmonary Mtb infection, which is associated with the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and increased myelopoiesis. The protective signature of β-glucan is mediated via IL-1 signaling, as β-glucan shows no protection in mice lacking a functional IL-1 receptor (IL1R<sup>-/-</sup>).

Zscan4 is transiently expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in preimplantation embryos and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming. However, little is known about the mechanism of Zscan4 underlying these processes of cell fate control.

The Zscan4f-Tet2 interaction promotes DNA demethylation and regulates the expression of target genes, particularly those encoding glycolytic enzymes and proteasome subunits. Zscan4f regulates metabolic rewiring, enhances proteasome function, and ultimately promotes iPSC generation. These results identify Zscan4f as an important partner of Tet2 in regulating target genes and promoting iPSC generation and suggest a possible and common mechanism shared by SCAN family transcription factors to recruit ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases to regulate diverse cellular processes, including reprogramming."	1
"32464091"	"A Primase-Induced Conformational Switch Controls the Stability of the Bacterial Replisome.Recent studies of bacterial DNA replication have led to a picture of the replisome as an entity that freely exchanges DNA polymerases and displays intermittent coupling between the helicase and polymerase(s). Challenging the textbook model of the polymerase holoenzyme acting as a stable complex coordinating the replisome, these observations suggest a role of the helicase as the central organizing hub. We show here that the molecular origin of this newly found plasticity lies in the 500-fold increase in strength of the interaction between the polymerase holoenzyme and the replicative helicase upon association of the primase with the replisome. By combining in vitro ensemble-averaged and single-molecule assays, we demonstrate that this conformational switch operates during replication and promotes recruitment of multiple holoenzymes at the fork. Our observations provide a molecular mechanism for polymerase exchange and offer a revised model for the replication reaction that emphasizes its stochasticity."	0
"32187551"	"Mesenchymal Stem and Stromal Cells Harness Macrophage-Derived Amphiregulin to Maintain Tissue Homeostasis.The cross-talk between mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (MSCs) and macrophages is critical for the restoration of tissue homeostasis after injury. Here, we demonstrate a pathway through which MSCs instruct macrophages to resolve inflammation and preserve tissue-specific stem cells, leading to homeostasis in mice with autoimmune uveoretinitis and sterile-injury-induced corneal epithelial stem cell deficiency. Distinct from their conventional role in macrophage reprogramming to anti-inflammatory phenotype by a PGE2-dependent mechanism, MSCs enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages, which partly depends on the uptake of MSC mitochondria-containing extracellular vesicles. The MSC-primed macrophages increase the secretion of amphiregulin (AREG) in a phagocytosis-dependent manner. AREG is essential for MSC-primed macrophages to suppress immune responses through regulatory T (Treg) cells and to protect corneal epithelial stem cells via apoptosis inhibition and proliferation promotion. Hence, the data reveal that MSCs harness macrophage-derived AREG to maintain tissue homeostasis after injury and provide a therapeutic target in immune-mediated disease and regenerative medicine."	0
"32665402"	"Mechanisms determining a differential threshold for sensing Src family kinase activity by B and T cell antigen receptors.Although signal transduction by immunoreceptors such as the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), B cell antigen receptor (BCR), and Fc receptors uses the same schematic and similar molecules, the threshold and the fine-tuning are set differently for each receptor. One manifestation of these differences is that inhibition of Src family kinases (SFK) blocks TCR but not BCR signaling. SFKs are key kinases phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) in both these receptors. However, it has been proposed that in B cells, downstream kinase SYK can phosphorylate ITAM sequences independently of SFK, allowing it to compensate for the loss of SFK activity, whereas its T cell paralog ZAP-70 is not capable of this compensation. To test this proposal, we examined signaling in SYK- and ZAP-70-deficient B and T cell lines expressing SYK or ZAP-70. We also analyzed signal transduction in T cells expressing BCR or B cells expressing part of the TCR complex. We show that when compared with ZAP-70, SYK lowered the threshold for SFK activity necessary to initiate antigen receptor signaling in both T and B cells. However, neither SYK nor ZAP-70 were able to initiate signaling independently of SFK. We further found that additional important factors are involved in setting this threshold. These include differences between the antigen receptor complexes themselves and the spatial separation of the key transmembrane adaptor protein LAT from the TCR. Thus, immunoreceptor sensing of SFK activity is a complex process regulated at multiple levels."	0
"32668260"	"Sensory Neuroblast Quiescence Depends on Vascular Cytoneme Contacts and Sensory Neuronal Differentiation Requires Initiation of Blood Flow.In many organs, stem cell function depends on communication with their niche partners. Cranial sensory neurons develop in close proximity to blood vessels; however, whether vasculature is an integral component of their niches is yet unknown. Here, two separate roles for vasculature in cranial sensory neurogenesis in zebrafish are uncovered. The first involves precise spatiotemporal endothelial-neuroblast cytoneme contacts and Dll4-Notch signaling to restrain neuroblast proliferation. The second, instead, requires blood flow to trigger a transcriptional response that modifies neuroblast metabolic status and induces sensory neuron differentiation. In contrast, no role of sensory neurogenesis in vascular development is found, suggesting unidirectional signaling from vasculature to sensory neuroblasts. Altogether, we demonstrate that the cranial vasculature constitutes a niche component of the sensory ganglia that regulates the pace of their growth and differentiation dynamics."	0
"31000437"	"Regulation of UCP1 and Mitochondrial Metabolism in Brown Adipose Tissue by Reversible Succinylation.Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and plays important roles in energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. We find that levels of mitochondrial protein succinylation and malonylation are high in BAT and subject to physiological and genetic regulation. BAT-specific deletion of Sirt5, a mitochondrial desuccinylase and demalonylase, results in dramatic increases in global protein succinylation and malonylation. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of succinylation reveals that Sirt5 regulates the key thermogenic protein in BAT, UCP1. Mutation of the two succinylated lysines in UCP1 to acyl-mimetic glutamine and glutamic acid significantly decreases its stability and activity. The reduced function of UCP1 and other proteins in Sirt5KO BAT results in impaired mitochondria respiration, defective mitophagy, and metabolic inflexibility. Thus, succinylation of UCP1 and other mitochondrial proteins plays an important role in BAT and in regulation of energy homeostasis."	1

The trimeric fusion glycoprotein (GP) is the sole target for neutralizing antibodies and is the major focus of vaccine development. Soluble GP ectodomains are unstable and mostly monomeric when not fused to a heterologous trimerization domain. Here, we report structure-based designs of Ebola and Marburg GP trimers based on a stabilizing mutation in the hinge loop in refolding region 1 and substitution of a partially buried charge at the interface of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. The combined substitutions (T577P and K588F) substantially increased trimer expression for Ebola GP proteins. We determined the crystal structure of stabilized GP from the Makona Zaire ebolavirus strain without a trimerization domain or complexed ligand. The structure reveals that the stabilized GP adopts the same trimeric prefusion conformation, provides insight into triggering of GP conformational changes, and should inform future filovirus vaccine development."	0
"32518159"	"The yeast exoribonuclease Xrn1 and associated factors modulate RNA polymerase II processivity in 5' and 3' gene regions.mRNA levels are determined by the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay. Protein factors that mediate both processes, including the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1, are responsible for a cross-talk between the two processes that buffers steady-state mRNA levels. However, the roles of these proteins in transcription remain elusive and controversial. Applying native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) to yeast cells, we show that Xrn1 functions mainly as a transcriptional activator and that its disruption manifests as a reduction of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. By combining our sequencing data and mathematical modeling of transcription, we found that Xrn1 modulates transcription initiation and elongation of its target genes. Furthermore, Pol II occupancy markedly increased near cleavage and polyadenylation sites in <i>xrn1</i>Δ cells, whereas its activity decreased, a characteristic feature of backtracked Pol II. We also provide indirect evidence that Xrn1 is involved in transcription termination downstream of polyadenylation sites. We noted that two additional decay factors, Dhh1 and Lsm1, seem to function similarly to Xrn1 in transcription, perhaps as a complex, and that the decay factors Ccr4 and Rpb4 also perturb transcription in other ways. Interestingly, the decay factors could differentiate between SAGA- and TFIID-dominated promoters. These two classes of genes responded differently to <i>XRN1</i> deletion in mRNA synthesis and were differentially regulated by mRNA decay pathways, raising the possibility that one distinction between these two gene classes lies in the mechanisms that balance mRNA synthesis with mRNA decay."	0

"31300275"	"Structures of the Rhodopsin-Transducin Complex: Insights into G-Protein Activation.Rhodopsin (Rho), a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in vertebrate vision, activates the G-protein transducin (G<sub>T</sub>) by catalyzing GDP-GTP exchange on its α subunit (Gα<sub>T</sub>). To elucidate the determinants of G<sub>T</sub> coupling and activation, we obtained cryo-EM structures of a fully functional, light-activated Rho-G<sub>T</sub> complex in the presence and absence of a G-protein-stabilizing nanobody. The structures illustrate how G<sub>T</sub> overcomes its low basal activity by engaging activated Rho in a conformation distinct from other GPCR-G-protein complexes. Moreover, the nanobody-free structures reveal native conformations of G-protein components and capture three distinct conformers showing the Gα<sub>T</sub> helical domain (αHD) contacting the Gβγ subunits. These findings uncover the molecular underpinnings of G-protein activation by visual rhodopsin and shed new light on the role played by Gβγ during receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange."	0
"32738194"	"Quality Control of ER Membrane Proteins by the RNF185/Membralin Ubiquitin Ligase Complex.Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although ERAD components involved in degradation of luminal substrates are well characterized, much less is known about quality control of membrane proteins. Here, we analyzed the degradation pathways of two short-lived ER membrane model proteins in mammalian cells. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide library screen, we identified an ERAD branch required for quality control of a subset of membrane proteins. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches, we showed that this ERAD branch is defined by an ER membrane complex consisting of the ubiquitin ligase RNF185, the ubiquitin-like domain containing proteins TMUB1/2 and TMEM259/Membralin, a poorly characterized protein. This complex cooperates with cytosolic ubiquitin ligase UBE3C and p97 ATPase in degrading their membrane substrates. Our data reveal that ERAD branches have remarkable specificity for their membrane substrates, suggesting that multiple, perhaps combinatorial, determinants are involved in substrate selection."	1
"32268123"	"DNAJB6, a Key Factor in Neuronal Sensitivity to Amyloidogenesis.CAG-repeat expansions in at least eight different genes cause neurodegeneration. The length of the extended polyglutamine stretches in the corresponding proteins is proportionally related to their aggregation propensity. Although these proteins are ubiquitously expressed, they predominantly cause toxicity to neurons. To understand this neuronal hypersensitivity, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington's disease patients. iPSC generation and neuronal differentiation are unaffected by polyglutamine proteins and show no spontaneous aggregate formation. However, upon glutamate treatment, aggregates form in neurons but not in patient-derived neural progenitors. During differentiation, the chaperone network is drastically rewired, including loss of expression of the anti-amyloidogenic chaperone DNAJB6. Upregulation of DNAJB6 in neurons antagonizes glutamate-induced aggregation, while knockdown of DNAJB6 in progenitors results in spontaneous polyglutamine aggregation. Loss of DNAJB6 expression upon differentiation is confirmed in vivo, explaining why stem cells are intrinsically protected against amyloidogenesis and protein aggregates are dominantly present in neurons."	0
"30472192"	"Comparative Analysis of Droplet-Based Ultra-High-Throughput Single-Cell RNA-Seq Systems.Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system."	0

SghA is a newly identified virulence factor enzymatically releasing salicylic acid from its glucoside conjugate and controlling plant tumor development. Here, we report the structural basis of SghR, a LacI-type transcription factor highly conserved in <i>Rhizobiaceae</i> family, regulating the expression of SghA and involved in tumorigenesis. We identified and characterized the binding site of SghR on the promoter region of <i>sghA</i> and then determined the crystal structures of apo-SghR, SghR complexed with its operator DNA, and ligand sucrose, respectively.

"30554945"	"Target-Specific Precision of CRISPR-Mediated Genome Editing.The CRISPR-Cas9 system has successfully been adapted to edit the genome of various organisms. However, our ability to predict the editing outcome at specific sites is limited. Here, we examined indel profiles at over 1,000 genomic sites in human cells and uncovered general principles guiding CRISPR-mediated DNA editing. We find that precision of DNA editing (i.e., recurrence of a specific indel) varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly preferred indel and others displaying numerous infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency and a preference for single-nucleotide homologous insertions. Precise targets and editing outcome can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Indel profiles are robust, but they can be influenced by chromatin features. Our findings have important implications for clinical applications of CRISPR technology and reveal general patterns of broken end joining that can provide insights into DNA repair mechanisms."	0
"31255466"	"EXD2 Protects Stressed Replication Forks and Is Required for Cell Viability in the Absence of BRCA1/2.Accurate DNA replication is essential to preserve genomic integrity and prevent chromosomal instability-associated diseases including cancer. Key to this process is the cells' ability to stabilize and restart stalled replication forks. Here, we show that the EXD2 nuclease is essential to this process. EXD2 recruitment to stressed forks suppresses their degradation by restraining excessive fork regression. Accordingly, EXD2 deficiency leads to fork collapse, hypersensitivity to replication inhibitors, and genomic instability. Impeding fork regression by inactivation of SMARCAL1 or removal of RECQ1's inhibition in EXD2<sup>-/-</sup> cells restores efficient fork restart and genome stability. Moreover, purified EXD2 efficiently processes substrates mimicking regressed forks. Thus, this work identifies a mechanism underpinned by EXD2's nuclease activity, by which cells balance fork regression with fork restoration to maintain genome stability. Interestingly, from a clinical perspective, we discover that EXD2's depletion is synthetic lethal with mutations in BRCA1/2, implying a non-redundant role in replication fork protection."	0
"32348764"	"Complex Genetic Architecture Underlies Regulation of Influenza-A-Virus-Specific Antibody Responses in the Collaborative Cross.Host genetic factors play a fundamental role in regulating humoral immunity to viral infection, including influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we utilize the Collaborative Cross (CC), a mouse genetic reference population, to study genetic regulation of variation in antibody response following IAV infection. CC mice show significant heritable variation in the magnitude, kinetics, and composition of IAV-specific antibody response. We map 23 genetic loci associated with this variation. Analysis of a subset of these loci finds that they broadly affect the antibody response to IAV as well as other viruses. Candidate genes are identified based on predicted variant consequences and haplotype-specific expression patterns, and several show overlap with genes identified in human mapping studies. These findings demonstrate that the host antibody response to IAV infection is under complex genetic control and highlight the utility of the CC in modeling and identifying genetic factors with translational relevance to human health and disease."	0
"32783933"	"Activation of a Specific Gut Bacteroides-Folate-Liver Axis Benefits for the Alleviation of Nonalcoholic Hepatic Steatosis.A beneficial gut Bacteroides-folate-liver pathway regulating lipid metabolism is demonstrated. Oral administration of a Ganoderma meroterpene derivative (GMD) ameliorates nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in the liver of fa/fa rats by reducing endotoxemia, enhancing lipid oxidation, decreasing de novo lipogenesis, and suppressing lipid export from the liver. An altered gut microbiota with an increase of butyrate and folate plays a causative role in the effects of GMD. The commensal bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides uniformis, which are enriched by GMD, are major contributors to the increased gut folate. Administration of live B. xylanisolvens reduces hepatic steatosis and enhances the folate-mediated signaling pathways in mice. Knockout of the folate biosynthetic folp gene in B. xylanisolvens blocks its folate production and beneficial effects.

"32393888"	"NFI transcription factors provide chromatin access to maintain stem cell identity while preventing unintended lineage fate choices.Tissue homeostasis and regeneration rely on resident stem cells (SCs), whose behaviour is regulated through niche-dependent crosstalk. The mechanisms underlying SC identity are still unfolding. Here, using spatiotemporal gene ablation in murine hair follicles, we uncover a critical role for the transcription factors (TFs) nuclear factor IB (NFIB) and IX (NFIX) in maintaining SC identity. Without NFI TFs, SCs lose their hair-regenerating capability, and produce skin bearing striking resemblance to irreversible human alopecia, which also displays reduced NFIs. Through single-cell transcriptomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq profiling, we expose a key role for NFIB and NFIX in governing super-enhancer maintenance of the key hair follicle SC-specific TF genes. When NFIB and NFIX are genetically removed, the stemness epigenetic landscape is lost. Super-enhancers driving SC identity are decommissioned, while unwanted lineages are de-repressed ectopically. Together, our findings expose NFIB and NFIX as crucial rheostats of tissue homeostasis, functioning to safeguard the SC epigenome from a breach in lineage confinement that otherwise triggers irreversible tissue degeneration."	0

"30850330"	"Pif1-Family Helicases Support Fork Convergence during DNA Replication Termination in Eukaryotes.The convergence of two DNA replication forks creates unique problems during DNA replication termination. In E. coli and SV40, the release of torsional strain by type II topoisomerases is critical for converging replisomes to complete DNA synthesis, but the pathways that mediate fork convergence in eukaryotes are unknown. We studied the convergence of reconstituted yeast replication forks that include all core replisome components and both type I and type II topoisomerases. We found that most converging forks stall at a very late stage, indicating a role for additional factors. We showed that the Pif1 and Rrm3 DNA helicases promote efficient fork convergence and completion of DNA synthesis, even in the absence of type II topoisomerase. Furthermore, Rrm3 and Pif1 are also important for termination of plasmid DNA replication in vivo.

"32362315"	"Mechanistic Insight into Crossing over during Mouse Meiosis.Crossover recombination is critical for meiotic chromosome segregation, but how mammalian crossing over is accomplished is poorly understood. Here, we illuminate how strands exchange during meiotic recombination in male mice by analyzing patterns of heteroduplex DNA in recombinant molecules preserved by the mismatch correction deficiency of Msh2<sup>-/-</sup> mutants. Surprisingly, MSH2-dependent recombination suppression was not evident. However, a substantial fraction of crossover products retained heteroduplex DNA, and some provided evidence of MSH2-independent correction. Biased crossover resolution was observed, consistent with asymmetry between DNA ends in earlier intermediates. Many crossover products yielded no heteroduplex DNA, suggesting dismantling by D-loop migration. Unlike the complexity of crossovers in yeast, these simple modifications of the original double-strand break repair model-asymmetry in recombination intermediates and D-loop migration-may be sufficient to explain most meiotic crossing over in mice while also addressing long-standing questions related to Holliday junction resolution."	0

After initiation, RNAPII enzymes pause after transcribing less than 100 bases; precisely how RNAPII pausing is enforced and regulated remains unclear. To address specific mechanistic questions, we reconstituted human RNAPII promoter-proximal pausing in vitro, entirely with purified factors (no extracts). As expected, NELF and DSIF increased pausing, and P-TEFb promoted pause release. Unexpectedly, the PIC alone was sufficient to reconstitute pausing, suggesting RNAPII pausing is an inherent PIC function. In agreement, pausing was lost upon replacement of the TFIID complex with TATA-binding protein (TBP), and PRO-seq experiments revealed widespread disruption of RNAPII pausing upon acute depletion (t = 60 min) of TFIID subunits in human or Drosophila cells. These results establish a TFIID requirement for RNAPII pausing and suggest pause regulatory factors may function directly or indirectly through TFIID."	0
"32755579"	"The Ubiquitin Ligase TRIP12 Limits PARP1 Trapping and Constrains PARP Inhibitor Efficiency.PARP inhibitors (PARPi) cause synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance."	0
"32492414"	"Chaperone-Mediated Protein Disaggregation Triggers Proteolytic Clearance of Intra-nuclear Protein Inclusions.The formation of insoluble inclusions in the cytosol and nucleus is associated with impaired protein homeostasis and is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the absence of the autophagic machinery, nuclear protein aggregates require a solubilization step preceding degradation by the 26S proteasome. Using yeast, we identify a nuclear protein quality control pathway required for the clearance of protein aggregates. The nuclear J-domain protein Apj1 supports protein disaggregation together with Hsp70 but independent of the canonical disaggregase Hsp104. Disaggregation mediated by Apj1/Hsp70 promotes turnover rather than refolding. A loss of Apj1 activity uncouples disaggregation from proteasomal turnover, resulting in accumulation of toxic soluble protein species. Endogenous substrates of the Apj1/Hsp70 pathway include both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which aggregate inside the nucleus upon proteotoxic stress. These findings demonstrate the coordinated activity of the Apj1/Hsp70 disaggregation system with the 26S proteasome in facilitating the clearance of toxic inclusions inside the nucleus."	0
"32540968"	"Dysfunctional telomeres trigger cellular senescence mediated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase.Defective DNA damage response (DDR) signaling is a common mechanism that initiates and maintains the cellular senescence phenotype. Dysfunctional telomeres activate DDR signaling, genomic instability, and cellular senescence, but the links among these events remains unclear. Here, using an array of biochemical and imaging techniques, including a highly regulatable CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to induce DNA double strand breaks specifically in the telomeres, ChIP, telomere immunofluorescence, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH), micronuclei imaging, and the telomere shortest length assay (TeSLA), we show that chromosome mis-segregation due to imperfect DDR signaling in response to dysfunctional telomeres creates a preponderance of chromatin fragments in the cytosol, which leads to a premature senescence phenotype. We found that this phenomenon is caused not by telomere shortening, but by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognizing cytosolic chromatin fragments and then activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream interferon signaling. Significantly, genetic and pharmacological manipulation of cGAS not only attenuated immune signaling, but also prevented premature cellular senescence in response to dysfunctional telomeres. The findings of our study uncover a cellular intrinsic mechanism involving the cGAS-mediated cytosolic self-DNA-sensing pathway that initiates premature senescence independently of telomere shortening."	0

Activated dynein complexes consist of one or two dynein dimers, the dynactin complex and an 'activating adaptor', and they show faster velocity when two dynein dimers are present<sup>3-6</sup>. Little is known about the assembly process of this massive ~4 MDa complex. Here, using purified recombinant human proteins, we uncover a role for the dynein-binding protein LIS1 in promoting the formation of activated dynein-dynactin complexes that contain two dynein dimers. Complexes activated by proteins representing three families of activating adaptors-BicD2, Hook3 and Ninl-all show enhanced motile properties in the presence of LIS1. Activated dynein complexes do not require sustained LIS1 binding for fast velocity. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that human LIS1 binds to dynein at two sites on the motor domain of dynein. Our research suggests that LIS1 binding at these sites functions in multiple stages of assembling the motile dynein-dynactin-activating adaptor complex."	0
"31924448"	"Antisense-Mediated Transcript Knockdown Triggers Premature Transcription Termination.Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that trigger RNase-H-mediated cleavage are commonly used to knock down transcripts for experimental or therapeutic purposes. In particular, ASOs are frequently used to functionally interrogate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and discriminate lncRNA loci that produce functional RNAs from those whose activity is attributable to the act of transcription. Transcription termination is triggered by cleavage of nascent transcripts, generally during polyadenylation, resulting in degradation of the residual RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated RNA by XRN2 and dissociation of elongating Pol II. Here, we show that ASOs act upon nascent transcripts and, consequently, induce premature transcription termination downstream of the cleavage site in an XRN2-dependent manner. Targeting the transcript 3' end with ASOs, however, allows transcript knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the gene body. These results demonstrate that the effects of ASOs on transcription must be considered for appropriate experimental and therapeutic use of these reagents."	0

Here, we provide biochemical, structural, functional, and clinical evidence that Cathepsin S (CTSS) alterations induce a tumor-promoting immune microenvironment in follicular lymphoma (FL). We found CTSS mutations at Y132 in 6% of FL (19/305). Another 13% (37/286) had CTSS amplification, which was associated with higher CTSS expression. CTSS Y132 mutations lead to accelerated autocatalytic conversion from an enzymatically inactive profrom to active CTSS and increased substrate cleavage, including CD74, which regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II)-restricted antigen presentation. Lymphoma cells with hyperactive CTSS more efficiently activated antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro. Tumors with hyperactive CTSS showed increased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine perturbation in a mouse model and in human FLs. In mice, this CTSS-induced immune microenvironment promoted tumor growth.

Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and other imprinted loci, in addition to impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and loss of developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we use to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis.

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and fueling an exacerbated cytokine response."	0
"32392469"	"Single-Cell Tracing Dissects Regulation of Maintenance and Inheritance of Transcriptional Reinduction Memory.Transcriptional memory of gene expression enables adaptation to repeated stimuli across many organisms. However, the regulation and heritability of transcriptional memory in single cells and through divisions remains poorly understood. Here, we combined microfluidics with single-cell live imaging to monitor Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase 1 (GAL1) expression over multiple generations. By applying pedigree analysis, we dissected and quantified the maintenance and inheritance of transcriptional reinduction memory in individual cells through multiple divisions. We systematically screened for loss- and gain-of-memory knockouts to identify memory regulators in thousands of single cells. We identified new loss-of-memory mutants, which affect memory inheritance into progeny. We also unveiled a gain-of-memory mutant, elp6Δ, and suggest that this new phenotype can be mediated through decreased histone occupancy at the GAL1 promoter. Our work uncovers principles of maintenance and inheritance of gene expression states and their regulators at the single-cell level."	0
"32294440"	"Phosphoglycerate Mutase 1 Activates DNA Damage Repair via Regulation of WIP1 Activity.The metabolic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is overexpressed in several types of cancer, suggesting an additional function beyond its established role in the glycolytic pathway. We here report that PGAM1 is overexpressed in gliomas where it increases the efficiency of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by cytoplasmic binding of WIP1 phosphatase, thereby preventing WIP1 nuclear translocation and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing of PGAM1 expression in glioma cells consequently decreases formation of γ-H2AX foci, increases apoptosis, and decreases clonogenicity following irradiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with PGAM1-knockdown cells have significantly improved survival after treatment with IR and TMZ. These effects are counteracted by exogenous expression of two kinase-dead PGAM1 mutants, H186R and Y92F, indicating an important non-enzymatic function of PGAM1. Our findings identify PGAM1 as a potential therapeutic target in gliomas."	1
"32362314"	"A Multibasic Cleavage Site in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Is Essential for Infection of Human Lung Cells.The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention."	0
"31421981"	"Nucleo-cytoplasmic Partitioning of ARF Proteins Controls Auxin Responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.The phytohormone auxin plays crucial roles in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. The auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factor family regulates auxin-responsive gene expression and exhibits nuclear localization in regions of high auxin responsiveness. Here we show that the ARF7 and ARF19 proteins accumulate in micron-sized assemblies within the cytoplasm of tissues with attenuated auxin responsiveness. We found that the intrinsically disordered middle region and the folded PB1 interaction domain of ARFs drive protein assembly formation. Mutation of a single lysine within the PB1 domain abrogates cytoplasmic assemblies, promotes ARF nuclear localization, and results in an altered transcriptome and morphological defects. Our data suggest a model in which ARF nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning regulates auxin responsiveness, providing a mechanism for cellular competence for auxin signaling."	0

However, their function and regulation remain considerably elusive, particularly those of less abundant variants. We demonstrate the human 20S proteasome recombinant assembly and confirmed the recombinant complex integrity biochemically and with a 2.6 Å resolution cryo-EM map. To assess its competence to form higher-order assemblies, we prepared and analyzed recombinant human 20S-PA200, a poorly characterized nuclear complex. Its 3.0 Å resolution cryo-EM structure reveals the PA200 unique architecture; the details of its intricate interactions with the proteasome, resulting in unparalleled proteasome α ring rearrangements; and the molecular basis for PA200 allosteric modulation of the proteasome active sites. Non-protein cryo-EM densities could be assigned to PA200-bound inositol phosphates, and we speculate regarding their functional role. Here we open extensive opportunities to study the fundamental properties of the diverse and distinct eukaryotic proteasome variants and to improve proteasome targeting under different therapeutic conditions."	0
"31732458"	"DNA Methylation and Histone H1 Jointly Repress Transposable Elements and Aberrant Intragenic Transcripts.DNA methylation and histone H1 mediate transcriptional silencing of genes and transposable elements, but how they interact is unclear. In plants and animals with mosaic genomic methylation, functionally mysterious methylation is also common within constitutively active housekeeping genes. Here, we show that H1 is enriched in methylated sequences, including genes, of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet this enrichment is independent of DNA methylation. Loss of H1 disperses heterochromatin, globally alters nucleosome organization, and activates H1-bound genes, but only weakly de-represses transposable elements. However, H1 loss strongly activates transposable elements hypomethylated through mutation of DNA methyltransferase MET1. Hypomethylation of genes also activates antisense transcription, which is modestly enhanced by H1 loss. Our results demonstrate that H1 and DNA methylation jointly maintain transcriptional homeostasis by silencing transposable elements and aberrant intragenic transcripts. Such functionality plausibly explains why DNA methylation, a well-known mutagen, has been maintained within coding sequences of crucial plant and animal genes."	0
"31805521"	"Set1/COMPASS repels heterochromatin invasion at euchromatic sites by disrupting Suv39/Clr4 activity and nucleosome stability.Protection of euchromatin from invasion by gene-repressive heterochromatin is critical for cellular health and viability. In addition to constitutive loci such as pericentromeres and subtelomeres, heterochromatin can be found interspersed in gene-rich euchromatin, where it regulates gene expression pertinent to cell fate. While heterochromatin and euchromatin are globally poised for mutual antagonism, the mechanisms underlying precise spatial encoding of heterochromatin containment within euchromatic sites remain opaque. We investigated ectopic heterochromatin invasion by manipulating the fission yeast mating type locus boundary using a single-cell spreading reporter system. We found that heterochromatin repulsion is locally encoded by Set1/COMPASS on certain actively transcribed genes and that this protective role is most prominent at heterochromatin islands, small domains interspersed in euchromatin that regulate cell fate specifiers. Sensitivity to invasion by heterochromatin, surprisingly, is not dependent on Set1 altering overall gene expression levels. Rather, the gene-protective effect is strictly dependent on Set1's catalytic activity. H3K4 methylation, the Set1 product, antagonizes spreading in two ways: directly inhibiting catalysis by Suv39/Clr4 and locally disrupting nucleosome stability. Taken together, these results describe a mechanism for spatial encoding of euchromatic signals that repel heterochromatin invasion."	0
"30792173"	"Structural Snapshots of 26S Proteasome Reveal Tetraubiquitin-Induced Conformations.The 26S proteasome is the ATP-dependent protease responsible for regulating the proteome of eukaryotic cells through degradation of mainly ubiquitin-tagged substrates. In order to understand how proteasome responds to ubiquitin signal, we resolved an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of proteasome in the presence of K48-Ub<sub>4</sub>, with three of them resolved at near-atomic resolution. We identified a conformation with stabilized ubiquitin receptors and a previously unreported orientation of the lid, assigned as a Ub-accepted state C1-b. We determined another structure C3-b with localized K48-Ub<sub>4</sub> to the toroid region of Rpn1, assigned as a substrate-processing state. Our structures indicate that tetraUb induced conformational changes in proteasome could initiate substrate degradation. We also propose a CP gate-opening mechanism involving the propagation of the motion of the lid to the gate through the Rpn6-α2 interaction. Our results enabled us to put forward a model of a functional cycle for proteasomes induced by tetraUb and nucleotide."	0
"31539507"	"Lysine Methylation Regulators Moonlighting outside the Epigenome.Landmark discoveries made nearly two decades ago identified known transcriptional regulators as histone lysine methyltransferases. Since then, the field of lysine methylation signaling has been dominated by studies of how this small chemical posttranslational modification regulates gene expression and other chromatin-based processes. However, recent advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics have revealed that histones are just a subset of the thousands of eukaryotic proteins marked by lysine methylation. As the writers, erasers, and readers of histone lysine methylation are emerging as a promising therapeutic target class for cancer and other diseases, a key challenge for the field is to define the full spectrum of activities for these proteins. Here we summarize recent discoveries implicating non-histone lysine methylation as a major regulator of diverse cellular processes. We further discuss recent technological innovations that are enabling the expanded study of lysine methylation signaling. Collectively, these findings are shaping our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of non-histone protein regulation through this dynamic and multi-functional posttranslational modification."	0
"32755589"	"RGS6 Mediates Effects of Voluntary Running on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.Voluntary running enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with consequences for hippocampal-dependent learning ability and mood regulation. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that voluntary running induces unique and dynamic gene expression changes specifically within the adult-born hippocampal neurons, with significant impact on genes involved in neuronal maturation and human diseases. We identify the regulator of G protein signaling 6 (RGS6) as a key factor that mediates running impact on adult-born neurons. RGS6 overexpression mimics the positive effects of voluntary running on morphological and physiological maturation of adult new neurons and reduced sensitivity of adult-born neurons to the inhibitory effect of GABA<sub>B</sub> (γ-Aminobutyric acid B) receptor activation. Knocking down RGS6 abolishes running-enhanced neuronal maturation and hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent learning and anxiolytic effect. Our study provides a data resource showing genome-wide intrinsic molecular changes in adult-born hippocampal neurons that contribute to voluntary running-induced neurogenesis."	0
"32183942"	"N<sup>6</sup>-Deoxyadenosine Methylation in Mammalian Mitochondrial DNA.N<sup>6</sup>-Methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA) has recently been shown to exist and play regulatory roles in eukaryotic genomic DNA (gDNA). However, the biological functions of 6mA in mammals have yet to be adequately explored, largely due to its low abundance in most mammalian genomes. Here, we report that mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is enriched for 6mA. The level of 6mA in HepG2 mtDNA is at least 1,300-fold higher than that in gDNA under normal growth conditions, corresponding to approximately four 6mA modifications on each mtDNA molecule. METTL4, a putative mammalian methyltransferase, can mediate mtDNA 6mA methylation, which contributes to attenuated mtDNA transcription and a reduced mtDNA copy number. Mechanistically, the presence of 6mA could repress DNA binding and bending by mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM). Under hypoxia, the 6mA level in mtDNA could be further elevated, suggesting regulatory roles for 6mA in mitochondrial stress response. Our study reveals DNA 6mA as a regulatory mark in mammalian mtDNA."	0

Here, we study their differentiation pathways in relation with their sampling, migratory, and T cell-priming abilities. Among four identified LysoDC differentiation stages displaying similar phagocytic activity, one is located in follicles, and the others reside in subepithelial domes (SED), where they proliferate and mature as they get closer to the epithelium. Mature LysoDCs but not macrophages express a gene set in common with conventional dendritic cells and prime naive helper T cells in vitro. At steady state, they do not migrate into naive T cell-enriched interfollicular regions (IFRs), but upon stimulation, they express the chemokine receptor CCR7 and migrate from SED to the IFR periphery, where they strongly interact with proliferative immune cells. Finally, we show that LysoDCs populate human Peyer's patches, strengthening their interest as targets for modulating intestinal immunity."	0
"31968258"	"Ex Vivo Expanded 3D Human Kidney Spheres Engraft Long Term and Repair Chronic Renal Injury in Mice.End-stage renal disease is a worldwide epidemic requiring renal replacement therapy. Harvesting tissue from failing kidneys and autotransplantation of tissue progenitors could theoretically delay the need for dialysis. Here we use healthy and end-stage human adult kidneys to robustly expand proliferative kidney epithelial cells and establish 3D kidney epithelial cultures termed ""nephrospheres."" Formation of nephrospheres reestablishes renal identity and function in primary cultures. Transplantation into NOD/SCID mice shows that nephrospheres restore self-organogenetic properties lost in monolayer cultures, allowing long-term engraftment as tubular structures, potentially adding nephron segments and demonstrating self-organization as critical to survival. Furthermore, long-term tubular engraftment of nephrospheres is functionally beneficial in murine models of chronic kidney disease. Remarkably, nephrospheres inhibit pro-fibrotic collagen production in cultured fibroblasts via paracrine modulation, while transplanted nephrospheres induce transcriptional signatures of proliferation and release from quiescence, suggesting re-activation of endogenous repair. These data support the use of human nephrospheres for renal cell therapy."	0

We identify a proinflammatory F480<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macrophage population that is associated with response rather than resistance to avelumab. These macrophages are the primary source of the interferon-inducible chemokine Cxcl9, which facilitates the recruitment of protective Cxcr3<sup>+</sup> T cells. Consequently, the efficacy of avelumab in mouse tumor models is dependent on Cxcr3 and Cxcl9, and baseline levels of Cxcl9 in patients treated with avelumab are associated with clinical response and overall survival. These data suggest that, within the broadly immune-suppressive macrophage compartment, a pro-inflammatory population exists that promotes responsiveness to PD-L1 blockade."	0
"32726578"	"GIGYF2 and 4EHP Inhibit Translation Initiation of Defective Messenger RNAs to Assist Ribosome-Associated Quality Control.Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways protect cells from toxicity caused by incomplete protein products resulting from translation of damaged or problematic mRNAs. Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved mechanisms that lead to degradation of faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptides. Here we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation of faulty mRNAs and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function."	0
"30954403"	"The Phospho-Code Determining Circadian Feedback Loop Closure and Output in Neurospora.In the negative feedback loop driving fungal and animal circadian oscillators, negative elements (FREQUENCY [FRQ], PERIODS [PERs], and CRYPTOCHROMES [CRYs]) are understood to inhibit their own expression, in part by promoting the phosphorylation of their heterodimeric transcriptional activators (e.g., White Collar-1 [WC-1]-WC-2 [White Collar complex; WCC] and BMAL1/Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput [CLOCK]). However, correlations between heterodimer activity and phosphorylation are weak, contradictions exist, and mechanistic details are almost wholly lacking. We report mapping of 80 phosphosites on WC-1 and 15 on WC-2 and elucidation of the time-of-day-specific code, requiring both a group of phosphoevents on WC-1 and two distinct clusters on WC-2, that governs circadian repression, leading to feedback loop closure. Combinatorial control via phosphorylation also governs rhythmic WCC binding to the promoters of clock-controlled genes mediating the essential first step in circadian output, a group encoding both transcription factors and signaling proteins. These data provide a basic mechanistic understanding for fundamental events underlying circadian negative feedback and output, key aspects of circadian biology."	0
"32101744"	"Adaptive Evolution Targets a piRNA Precursor Transcription Network.In Drosophila, transposon-silencing piRNAs are derived from heterochromatic clusters and a subset of euchromatic transposon insertions, which are bound by the Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to Deadlock, which recruits TRF2 to promote non-canonical transcription from both genomic strands. Cuff function is less well understood, but this Rai1 homolog shows hallmarks of adaptive evolution, which can remodel functional interactions within host defense systems. Supporting this hypothesis, Drosophila simulans Cutoff is a dominant-negative allele when expressed in Drosophila melanogaster, in which it traps Deadlock, TRF2, and the conserved transcriptional co-repressor CtBP in stable complexes. Cutoff functions with Rhino and Deadlock to drive non-canonical transcription. In contrast, CtBP suppresses canonical transcription of transposons and promoters flanking the major germline clusters, and canonical transcription interferes with downstream non-canonical transcription and piRNA production. Adaptive evolution thus targets interactions among Cutoff, TRF2, and CtBP that balance canonical and non-canonical piRNA precursor transcription."	0
"32755592"	"Marginal Zone Formation Requires ACKR3 Expression on B Cells.The marginal zone (MZ) contributes to the highly organized spleen microarchitecture. We show that expression of atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) defines two equal-sized populations of mouse MZ B cells (MZBs). ACKR3 is required for development of a functional MZ and for positioning of MZBs. Deletion of ACKR3 on B cells distorts the MZ, and MZBs fail to deliver antigens to follicles, reducing humoral responses. Reconstitution of MZ-deficient CD19<sup>ko</sup> mice shows that ACKR3<sup>-</sup> MZBs can differentiate into ACKR3<sup>+</sup> MZBs, but not vice versa. The lack of a MZ is rescued by adoptive transfer of ACKR3-sufficient, and less by ACKR3-deficient, follicular B cells (FoBs); hence, ACKR3 expression is crucial for establishment of the MZ. The inability of CD19<sup>ko</sup> mice to respond to T-independent antigen is rescued when ACKR3-proficient, but not ACKR3-deficient, FoBs are transferred. Accordingly, ACKR3-deficient FoBs are able to reconstitute the MZ if the niche is pre-established by ACKR3-proficient MZBs."	0

While mutations in the kelch propeller domain (K13 mutations) are associated with artemisinin resistance, a range of evidence suggests that other factors are critical for the establishment and subsequent transmission of resistance in the field. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of DNA damage and repair in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and find a strong link between enhanced DNA damage repair and artemisinin resistance. This experimental observation is further supported when variations in seven known DNA repair genes are found in resistant parasites, with six of these mutations being associated with K13 mutations. Our data provide important insights on confounding factors that are important for the establishment and spread of artemisinin resistance and may explain why resistance has not yet arisen in Africa."	0
"32209481"	"c-Src Promotes Tumorigenesis and Tumor Progression by Activating PFKFB3.Reprogramming of glucose metabolism is a key event in tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we show that active c-Src stimulates glycolysis by phosphorylating (Tyr194) and activating PFKFB3, a key enzyme that boosts glycolysis by producing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and activating PFK1. Increased glycolysis intermediates replenish non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine pathway for biosynthesis of cancer cells. PFKFB3 knockout (KO) cells and their counterpart reconstituted with PFKFB3-Y194F show comparably impaired abilities for proliferation, migration, and xenograft formation. Furthermore, PFKFB3-Y194F knockin mice show impaired glycolysis and, mating of these mice with APC<sup>min/+</sup> mice attenuates spontaneous colon cancer formation in APC<sup>min/+</sup> mice. In summary, we identify a specific mechanism by which c-Src mediates glucose metabolism to meet cancer cells' requirements for maximal biosynthesis and proliferation.

However, the defect of mutant SF3B1 is unknown. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from MDS patients and confirmed that SF3B1 mutants use aberrant 3' splice sites. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we purified complexes containing either wild-type or the hotspot K700E mutant SF3B1 and found that levels of a poorly studied spliceosomal protein, SUGP1, were reduced in mutant spliceosomes. Strikingly, SUGP1 knockdown completely recapitulated the splicing errors, whereas SUGP1 overexpression drove the protein, which our data suggest plays an important role in branchsite recognition, into the mutant spliceosome and partially rescued splicing. Other hotspot SF3B1 mutants showed similar altered splicing and diminished interaction with SUGP1. Our study demonstrates that SUGP1 loss is a common defect of spliceosomes with disease-causing SF3B1 mutations and, because this defect can be rescued, suggests possibilities for therapeutic intervention."	0

While the transcriptome profile of microglia directs microglial functions, how the microglial transcriptome can be regulated to alleviate AD pathology is largely unknown. Here, we show that injection of interleukin (IL)-33 in an AD transgenic mouse model ameliorates Aβ pathology by reprogramming microglial epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles to induce a microglial subpopulation with enhanced phagocytic activity. These IL-33-responsive microglia (IL-33RMs) express a distinct transcriptome signature that is highlighted by increased major histocompatibility complex class II genes and restored homeostatic signature genes. IL-33-induced remodeling of chromatin accessibility and PU.1 transcription factor binding at the signature genes of IL-33RM control their transcriptome reprogramming. Specifically, disrupting PU.1-DNA interaction abolishes the microglial state transition and Aβ clearance that is induced by IL-33.

In addition, we show that nog2 expression in the notochord is induced by at least one notochord enhancer and its loss of function reduces the number of pancreatic progenitors and impairs β cell differentiation. Tracing Nog2 diffusion, we show that Nog2 emanates from the notochord to the pancreas progenitor domain. Finally, we find a notochord enhancer in human and mice Nog genomic landscapes, suggesting that the acquisition of a Nog notochord enhancer occurred early in the vertebrate phylogeny and contributes to the development of complex organs like the pancreas."	0
"31420217"	"One-Carbon Metabolism Supports S-Adenosylmethionine and Histone Methylation to Drive Inflammatory Macrophages.Activated macrophages adapt their metabolic pathways to drive the pro-inflammatory phenotype, but little is known about the biochemical underpinnings of this process. Here, we find that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the pentose phosphate pathway, the serine synthesis pathway, and one-carbon metabolism, the synergism of which drives epigenetic reprogramming for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression. Glucose-derived ribose and one-carbon units fed by both glucose and serine metabolism are synergistically integrated into the methionine cycle through de novo ATP synthesis and fuel the generation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) during LPS-induced inflammation. Impairment of these metabolic pathways that feed SAM generation lead to anti-inflammatory outcomes, implicating SAM as an essential metabolite for inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, SAM generation maintains a relatively high SAM:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio to support histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation for IL-1β production. We therefore identify a synergistic effect of glucose and amino acid metabolism on orchestrating SAM availability that is intimately linked to the chromatin state for inflammation."	0

This finding has implications for the severe genetic disorder, Barth syndrome (BTHS), in which CL metabolism is perturbed because of mutations in the CL-remodeling enzyme, tafazzin. Here, we investigate the effects of tafazzin deficiency on iron homeostasis in the mouse myoblast model of BTHS tafazzin knockout (TAZ-KO) cells. Similarly to CL-deficient yeast cells, TAZ-KO cells exhibited elevated sensitivity to iron, as well as to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which was alleviated by the iron chelator deferoxamine. TAZ-KO cells exhibited increased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin and decreased expression of the iron importer transferrin receptor, likely reflecting a regulatory response to elevated mitochondrial iron. Reduced activities of mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster enzymes suggested that the mechanism underlying perturbation of iron homeostasis was defective iron-sulfur biogenesis. We observed decreased levels of Yfh1/frataxin, an essential component of the iron-sulfur biogenesis machinery, in mitochondria from TAZ-KO mouse cells and in CL-deleted yeast <i>crd1</i>Δ cells, indicating that the role of CL in iron-sulfur biogenesis is highly conserved.

"31474573"	"Polyamines Control eIF5A Hypusination, TFEB Translation, and Autophagy to Reverse B Cell Senescence.Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans."	1

However, this process lacks the necessary specificity to explain CL diversity, which is especially evident for highly specific CL compositions in mammalian tissues. To investigate the so far elusive regulatory origin of CL homeostasis in mice, we combine lipidomics, integrative transcriptomics, and data-driven machine learning. We demonstrate that not transcriptional regulation, but cellular phospholipid compositions are closely linked to the tissue specificity of CL patterns allowing artificial neural networks to precisely predict cross-tissue CL compositions in a consistent mechanistic specificity rationale. This is especially relevant for the interpretation of disease-related perturbations of CL homeostasis, by allowing differentiation between specific aberrations in CL metabolism and changes caused by global alterations in cellular (phospho-)lipid metabolism."	0

Here, we show that HSF1, a physiological substrate for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), constitutively suppresses this central metabolic sensor. By physically evoking conformational switching of AMPK, HSF1 impairs AMP binding to the γ subunits and enhances the PP2A-mediated de-phosphorylation, but it impedes the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr172, and retards ATP binding to the catalytic α subunits. These immediate and manifold regulations empower HSF1 to both repress AMPK under basal conditions and restrain its activation by diverse stimuli, thereby promoting lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and protein cholesteroylation. In vivo, HSF1 antagonizes AMPK to control body fat mass and drive the lipogenic phenotype and growth of melanomas independently of its intrinsic transcriptional action.

Cell culture systems for prion propagation have greatly advanced molecular insights into prion biology, but translation of <i>in vitro</i> to <i>in vivo</i> findings is often disappointing. A wider range of cell culture systems might help overcome these shortcomings. Here, we describe an immortalized mouse neuronal astrocyte cell line (C8D1A) that can be infected with murine prions. Both PrP<sup>C</sup> protein and mRNA levels in astrocytes were comparable with those in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines permitting persistent prion infection. We challenged astrocytes with three mouse-adapted prion strains (22L, RML, and ME7) and cultured them for six passages. Immunoblotting results revealed that the astrocytes propagated 22L prions well over all six passages, whereas ME7 prions did not replicate, and RML prions replicated only very weakly after five passages. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated similar results for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> Interestingly, when we used prion conversion activity as a readout in real-time quaking-induced conversion assays with RML-infected cell lysates, we observed a strong signal over all six passages, comparable with that for 22L-infected cells. These data indicate that the C8D1A cell line is permissive to prion infection. Moreover, the propagated prions differed in conversion and proteinase K-resistance levels in these astrocytes. We propose that the C8D1A cell line could be used to decipher prion strain biology."	0
"32433971"	"G-Protein-Coupled Receptor SRBC-48 Protects against Dendrite Degeneration and Reduced Longevity Due to Infection.Increasing evidence suggests that deficient immune modulation and microbial infections underline neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we show that the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) SRBC-48, which belongs to the class BC serpentine receptors, has a protective role in Caenorhabditis elegans dendrite degeneration caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Our results indicate that SRBC-48 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in AWC neurons to protect against infection-associated dendrite degeneration. The absence of SRBC-48 results in a reduced lifespan caused by a pathogen infection early in life that induces dendrite degeneration. The decreased longevity in animals deficient in SRBC-48 is due to uncontrolled activation of immune genes, particularly those regulated by the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16 that is part of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor homolog DAF-2. These results reveal how an infection early in life can not only induce dendrite degeneration but also reduce lifespan."	0
"32348762"	"Ensemble-Level Organization of Human Kinetochores and Evidence for Distinct Tension and Attachment Sensors.Kinetochores are multi-protein machines that form dynamic attachments to microtubules and control chromosome segregation. High fidelity is ensured because kinetochores can monitor attachment status and tension, using this information to activate checkpoints and error-correction mechanisms. To explore how kinetochores achieve this, we used two- and three-color subpixel fluorescence localization to define how proteins from six major complexes (CCAN, MIS12, NDC80, KNL1, RZZ, and SKA) and the checkpoint proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad2 are organized in the human kinetochore. This reveals how the outer kinetochore has a high nematic order and is largely invariant to the loss of attachment or tension, except for two mechanical sensors. First, Knl1 unravels to relay tension, and second, NDC80 undergoes jackknifing and loss of nematic order under microtubule detachment, with only the latter wired up to the checkpoint signaling system. This provides insight into how kinetochores integrate mechanical signals to promote error-free chromosome segregation."	0

Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation is associated with heterochromatin and gene repression during cell-fate change<sup>5</sup>, whereas histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation marks active gene promoters<sup>6</sup>. Mature oocytes are transcriptionally quiescent and possess remarkably broad domains of H3K4me3 (bdH3K4me3)<sup>1,2</sup>. It is unknown which factors contribute to the maintenance of the bdH3K4me3 landscape. Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) demethylates H3K9me3 at promoters marked by H3K4me3 in actively transcribing somatic cells<sup>7</sup>. Here, we report that KDM4A-mediated H3K9me3 demethylation at bdH3K4me3 in oocytes is crucial for normal pre-implantation development and zygotic genome activation after fertilization. The loss of KDM4A in oocytes causes aberrant H3K9me3 spreading over bdH3K4me3, resulting in insufficient transcriptional activation of genes, endogenous retroviral elements and chimeric transcripts initiated from long terminal repeats during zygotic genome activation. The catalytic activity of KDM4A is essential for normal epigenetic reprogramming and pre-implantation development. Hence, KDM4A plays a crucial role in preserving the maternal epigenome integrity required for proper zygotic genome activation and transfer of developmental control to the embryo."	0

Phosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A<sub>C</sub>) at tyrosine 307 has been claimed to inactivate PP2A and was examined in more than 180 studies using commercial antibodies, but this modification was never identified using mass spectrometry.

We used genomics, genetic, biochemical, and microscopic approaches to dissect their interplay in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that FACT and H2Bub globally repress antisense transcripts near the 5' end of genes and inside gene bodies, respectively. The accumulation of these transcripts is accompanied by changes at genic nucleosomes and Pol II redistribution. H2Bub is required for FACT activity in genic regions. In the H2Bub mutant, FACT binding to chromatin is altered and its association with histones is stabilized, which leads to the reduction of genic nucleosomes. Interestingly, FACT depletion globally restores nucleosomes in the H2Bub mutant. Moreover, in the absence of Pob3, the FACT Spt16 subunit controls the 3' end of genes. Furthermore, FACT maintains nucleosomes in subtelomeric regions, which is crucial for their compaction."	0
"32579921"	"The Kinase Activity of Drosophila BubR1 Is Required for Insulin Signaling-Dependent Stem Cell Maintenance.As a core component of the mitotic checkpoint complex, BubR1 has a modular organization of molecular functions, with KEN box and other motifs at the N terminus inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and a kinase domain at the C terminus, whose function remains unsettled, especially at organismal levels. We generate knock-in BubR1 mutations in the Drosophila genome to separately disrupt the KEN box and the kinase domain. All of the mutants are homozygously viable and fertile and show no defects in mitotic progression. The mutants without kinase activity have an increased lifespan and phenotypic changes associated with attenuated insulin signaling, including reduced InR on the cell membrane, weakened PI3K and AKT activity, and elevated expression of dFoxO targets. The BubR1 kinase-dead mutants have a reduced cap cell number in female germaria, which can be rescued by expressing a constitutively active InR. We conclude that one major physiological role of BubR1 kinase in Drosophila is to modulate insulin signaling."	0

Here we show that the expression and activity of the RBP TDP-43 and the long isoform of the lncRNA Neat1, the scaffold of the nuclear compartment ""paraspeckles,"" are reciprocal in pluripotent and differentiated cells because of their cross-regulation. In pluripotent cells, TDP-43 represses the formation of paraspeckles by enhancing the polyadenylated short isoform of Neat1. TDP-43 also promotes pluripotency by regulating alternative polyadenylation of transcripts encoding pluripotency factors, including Sox2, which partially protects its 3' UTR from miR-21-mediated degradation. Conversely, paraspeckles sequester TDP-43 and other RBPs from mRNAs and promote exit from pluripotency and embryonic patterning in the mouse. We demonstrate that cross-regulation between TDP-43 and Neat1 is essential for their efficient regulation of a broad network of genes and, therefore, of pluripotency and differentiation."	0
"32698005"	"Local Necrotic Cells Trigger Systemic Immune Activation via Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis in Drosophila.Necrotic cells elicit an inflammatory response through their endogenous factors with damage-associated molecular patterns. Blocking apoptosis in Drosophila wings leads to the necrosis-driven systemic immune response by unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that immune activation in response to necrotic cells is mediated by commensal gut microbiota. Removing the microbiome attenuates hyperactivation of the innate immune signaling IMD pathway in necrosis-induced flies. Necrotic cells in wings trigger Gluconobacter expansion in the gut. An isolated Gluconobacter sp. strain is sufficient for pathological IMD activation in necrosis-induced flies, while it is not inflammatory for control animals. In addition, bacterial colonization shifts the host metabolome and shortens the lifespan of necrosis-induced flies. This study shows that local necrosis triggers a pathological systemic inflammatory response through interaction between the host and the dysbiotic gut microbiome."	0

This modification has critical regulatory roles in various biological processes. Here, we report that deletion of Mettl14 dramatically reduces mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in developing B cells and severely blocks B cell development in mice. Deletion of Mettl14 impairs interleukin-7 (IL-7)-induced pro-B cell proliferation and the large-pre-B-to-small-pre-B transition and causes dramatic abnormalities in gene expression programs important for B cell development. Suppression of a group of transcripts by cytoplasmic m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 is critical to the IL-7-induced pro-B cell proliferation.

"32075735"	"Palmitate Is Increased in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Humans with Obesity and Induces Memory Impairment in Mice via Pro-inflammatory TNF-α.Obesity has been associated with cognitive decline, atrophy of brain regions related to learning and memory, and higher risk of developing dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurological alterations are still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid present at high amounts in fat-rich diets, in the brain. Palmitate is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of overweight and obese patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In mice, intracerebroventricular infusion of palmitate impairs synaptic plasticity and memory. Palmitate induces astroglial and microglial activation in the mouse hippocampus, and its deleterious impact is mediated by microglia-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling. Our results establish that obesity is associated with increases in CSF palmitate. By defining a pro-inflammatory mechanism by which abnormal levels of palmitate in the brain impair memory, the results further suggest that anti-inflammatory strategies may attenuate memory impairment in obesity."	0

Indeed, activities of PA Vglut1+ (PA<sup>Vglut1</sup>) neurons, as analyzed by post hoc c-Fos expression, differentiate trials in which attacks occur, or not, during resident-intruder assays. More importantly, chemogenetic activation of VMHvl-projecting PA<sup>Vglut1</sup> neurons robustly promote aggression while inhibition of these neurons reduces attacks. Finally, a connectivity map places VMHvl-projecting PA<sup>Vglut1</sup> neurons at the interface between emotion regulation and aggression as they receive broad inputs from limbic structures and project collaterally to the VMHvl and other targets. Taken together, these results point to VMHvl-projecting PA<sup>Vglut1</sup> neurons as a potential site for cortical gating of territorial aggression."	0

"32209485"	"BMP Signaling Gradient Scaling in the Zebrafish Pectoral Fin.Secreted growth factors can act as morphogens that form spatial concentration gradients in developing organs, thereby controlling growth and patterning. For some morphogens, adaptation of the gradients to tissue size allows morphological patterns to remain proportioned as the organs grow. In the zebrafish pectoral fin, we found that BMP signaling forms a two-dimensional gradient. The length of the gradient scales with tissue length and its amplitude increases with fin size according to a power-law. Gradient scaling and amplitude power-laws are signatures of growth control by time derivatives of morphogenetic signaling: cell division correlates with the fold change over time of the cellular signaling levels. We show that Smoc1 regulates BMP gradient scaling and growth in the fin. Smoc1 scales the gradient by means of a feedback loop: Smoc1 is a BMP agonist and BMP signaling represses Smoc1 expression.

"32698008"	"Axon Growth of CNS Neurons in Three Dimensions Is Amoeboid and Independent of Adhesions.During development of the central nervous system (CNS), neurons polarize and rapidly extend their axons to assemble neuronal circuits. The growth cone leads the axon to its target and drives axon growth. Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying axon growth in three dimensions. Live in situ imaging and super-resolution microscopy combined with pharmacological and molecular manipulations as well as biophysical force measurements revealed that growth cones extend CNS axons independent of pulling forces on their substrates and without the need for adhesions in three-dimensional (3D) environments. In 3D, microtubules grow unrestrained from the actomyosin cytoskeleton into the growth cone leading edge to enable rapid axon extension. Axons extend and polarize even in adhesion-inert matrices. Thus, CNS neurons use amoeboid mechanisms to drive axon growth. Together with our understanding that adult CNS axons regenerate by reactivating developmental processes, our findings illuminate how cytoskeletal manipulations enable axon regeneration in the adult CNS."	0

The catalytically active subunit Rrp44/Dis3 of the exosome in budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) is considered a protein present in these two subcellular compartments, and here we report that it not only localizes mainly to the nucleus, but is concentrated in the nucleolus, where the early pre-rRNA processing reactions take place. Moreover, we show by confocal microscopy analysis that the core exosome subunits Rrp41 and Rrp43 also localize largely to the nucleus and strongly accumulate in the nucleolus.

"32579924"	"Tonic GABAergic Inhibition Is Essential for Nerve Injury-Induced Afferent Remodeling in the Somatosensory Thalamus and Ectopic Sensations.Peripheral nerve injury induces functional and structural remodeling of neural circuits along the somatosensory pathways, forming the basis for somatotopic reorganization and ectopic sensations, such as referred phantom pain. However, the mechanisms underlying that remodeling remain largely unknown. Whisker sensory nerve injury drives functional remodeling in the somatosensory thalamus: the number of afferent inputs to each thalamic neuron increases from one to many. Here, we report that extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R)-mediated tonic inhibition is necessary for that remodeling. Extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents were potentiated rapidly after nerve injury in advance of remodeling. Pharmacological activation of the thalamic extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in intact mice induced similar remodeling. Notably, conditional deletion of extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the thalamus rescued both the injury-induced remodeling and the ectopic mechanical hypersensitivity.

Here, we report that BMP4 reconfigures the nuclear architecture during the primed-to-naive transition (PNT). We first established a BMP4-driven PNT and show that BMP4 orchestrates the chromatin accessibility dynamics during PNT. Among the loci opened early by BMP4, we identified Zbtb7a and Zbtb7b (Zbtb7a/b) as targets that drive PNT. ZBTB7A/B in turn facilitate the opening of naive pluripotent chromatin loci and the activation of nearby genes. Mechanistically, ZBTB7A not only binds to chromatin loci near to the genes that are activated, but also strategically occupies those that are silenced, consistent with a role of BMP4 in both activating and suppressing gene expression during PNT at the chromatin level. Our results reveal a previously unknown function of BMP4 in regulating nuclear architecture and link its targets ZBTB7A/B to chromatin remodelling and pluripotent fate control."	0

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to decomplexify interstitial cell populations in healthy and dystrophic skeletal muscles. We identify an interstitial CD142-positive cell population in mice and humans that is responsible for the inhibition of adipogenesis through GDF10 secretion. Furthermore, we show that the interstitial cell composition is completely altered in muscular dystrophy, with a near absence of CD142-positive cells.

Yet, it has been unclear whether implanted hGPCs are similarly able to remyelinate the diffusely demyelinated adult CNS. We, therefore, ask if hGPCs could remyelinate both congenitally hypomyelinated adult shiverers and normal adult mice after cuprizone demyelination. In adult shiverers, hGPCs broadly disperse and differentiate as myelinating oligodendrocytes after subcortical injection, improving both host callosal conduction and ambulation. Implanted hGPCs similarly remyelinate denuded axons after cuprizone demyelination, whether delivered before or after demyelination. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hGPCs back from cuprizone-demyelinated brains reveals their transcriptional activation of oligodendrocyte differentiation programs, while distinguishing them from hGPCs not previously exposed to demyelination. These data indicate the ability of transplanted hGPCs to disperse throughout the adult CNS, to broadly myelinate regions of dysmyelination, and also to be recruited as myelinogenic oligodendrocytes later in life, upon demyelination-associated demand."	0

O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which act in a nutrient- and stress-responsive manner. The precise role of O-GlcNAc in adult stem cells and the relationship between O-GlcNAc and the DNA damage response (DDR) is poorly understood. Here, we show that hyper-O-GlcNacylation leads to elevated insulin signaling, hyperproliferation, and DDR activation that mimic the glucose- and oxidative-stress-induced response. We discover a feedback mechanism involving key downstream effectors of DDR, ATM, ATR, and CHK1/2 that regulates OGT stability to promote O-GlcNAcylation and elevate DDR. This O-GlcNAc-dependent regulatory pathway is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in Drosophila and the DDR in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our findings reveal a conserved mechanistic link among O-GlcNAc cycling, stem cell self-renewal, and DDR with profound implications for stem-cell-derived diseases including cancer."	1
"32393887"	"The HOIL-1L ligase modulates immune signalling and cell death via monoubiquitination of LUBAC.The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which consists of HOIP, SHARPIN and HOIL-1L, promotes NF-κB activation and protects against cell death by generating linear ubiquitin chains. LUBAC contains two RING-IBR-RING (RBR) ubiquitin ligases (E3), and the HOIP RBR is responsible for catalysing linear ubiquitination. We found that HOIL-1L RBR plays a crucial role in regulating LUBAC. HOIL-1L RBR conjugates monoubiquitin onto all LUBAC subunits, followed by HOIP-mediated conjugation of linear chains onto monoubiquitin, and these linear chains attenuate the functions of LUBAC. The introduction of E3-defective HOIL-1L mutants into cells augmented linear ubiquitination, which protected the cells against Salmonella infection and cured dermatitis caused by reduced LUBAC levels due to SHARPIN loss. Our results reveal a regulatory mode of E3 ligases in which the accessory E3 in LUBAC downregulates the main E3 by providing preferred substrates for autolinear ubiquitination. Thus, inhibition of HOIL-1L E3 represents a promising strategy for treating severe infections or immunodeficiency."	0

We determined that the DNA translocase Mfd is an ""evolvability factor"" that promotes mutagenesis and is required for rapid resistance development to all antibiotics tested across highly divergent bacterial species. Importantly, hypermutator alleles that accelerate AMR development did not arise without Mfd, at least during evolution of trimethoprim resistance. We also show that Mfd's role in AMR development depends on its interactions with the RNA polymerase subunit RpoB and the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA. Our findings suggest that AMR development can be inhibited through inactivation of evolvability factors (potentially with ""anti-evolution"" drugs)-in particular, Mfd-providing an unexplored route toward battling the AMR crisis."	0
"30612880"	"Multisite Phosphorylation of S6K1 Directs a Kinase Phospho-code that Determines Substrate Selection.Multisite phosphorylation of kinases can induce on-off or graded regulation of catalytic activity; however, its influence on substrate specificity remains unclear. Here, we show that multisite phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) alters target selection. Agonist-inducible phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) by S6K1 in monocytes and adipocytes requires not only canonical phosphorylation at Thr<sup>389</sup> by mTORC1 but also phosphorylation at Ser<sup>424</sup> and Ser<sup>429</sup> in the C terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). S6K1 phosphorylation at these additional sites induces a conformational switch and is essential for high-affinity binding and phosphorylation of EPRS, but not canonical S6K1 targets, e.g., ribosomal protein S6. Unbiased proteomic analysis identified additional targets phosphorylated by multisite phosphorylated S6K1 in insulin-stimulated adipocytes-namely, coenzyme A synthase, lipocalin 2, and cortactin. Thus, embedded within S6K1 is a target-selective kinase phospho-code that integrates signals from mTORC1 and Cdk5 to direct an insulin-stimulated, post-translational metabolon determining adipocyte lipid metabolism."	1
"32426212"	"Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections.The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development."	0

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how vitamin B12 affects the development and maintenance of the nervous system are still unclear. Here, we report that vitamin B12 can regulate glial migration and synapse formation through control of isoform-specific expression of PTP-3/LAR PRTP (leukocyte-common antigen-related receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase). We found the uptake of diet-supplied vitamin B12 in the intestine to be critical for the expression of a long isoform of PTP-3 (PTP-3A) in neuronal and glial cells. The expression of PTP-3A cell autonomously regulates glial migration and synapse formation through interaction with an extracellular matrix protein NID-1/nidogen 1. Together, our findings demonstrate that isoform-specific regulation of PTP-3/ LAR PRTP expression is a key molecular mechanism that mediates vitamin-B12-dependent neuronal and glial development."	0

"32610126"	"Counter Regulation of Spic by NF-κB and STAT Signaling Controls Inflammation and Iron Metabolism in Macrophages.Activated macrophages must carefully calibrate their inflammatory responses to balance efficient pathogen control with inflammation-mediated tissue damage, but the molecular underpinnings of this ""balancing act"" remain unclear. Using genetically engineered mouse models and primary macrophage cultures, we show that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induces the expression of the transcription factor Spic selectively in patrolling monocytes and tissue macrophages by a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent mechanism. Functionally, Spic downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes iron efflux by regulating ferroportin expression in activated macrophages. Notably, interferon-gamma blocks Spic expression in a STAT1-dependent manner. High levels of interferon-gamma are indicative of ongoing infection, and in its absence, activated macrophages appear to engage a ""default"" Spic-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway. We also provide evidence for the engagement of this pathway in sterile inflammation. Taken together, our findings uncover a pathway wherein counter-regulation of Spic by NF-κB and STATs attune inflammatory responses and iron metabolism in macrophages."	1

Conversely, the role of m<sup>6</sup>A on the biogenesis and function of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has yet to be addressed. circRNAs belong to a class of covalently closed transcripts produced via a back-splicing reaction whereby a downstream 5' splice donor site fuses to an upstream 3' splice acceptor site. Starting from circ-ZNF609 as a study case, we discover that specific m<sup>6</sup>As control its accumulation and that METTL3 and YTHDC1 are required to direct the back-splicing reaction. This feature is shared with other circRNAs because we find a significant direct correlation among METTL3 requirement, YTHDC1 binding, and the ability of m<sup>6</sup>A exons to undergo back-splicing. Finally, because circ-ZNF609 displays the ability to be translated, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A modifications, through recognition by YTHDF3 and eIF4G2, modulate its translation."	0
"32006464"	"Localized Inhibition of Protein Phosphatase 1 by NUAK1 Promotes Spliceosome Activity and Reveals a MYC-Sensitive Feedback Control of Transcription.Deregulated expression of MYC induces a dependence on the NUAK1 kinase, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this dependence have not been fully clarified. Here, we show that NUAK1 is a predominantly nuclear protein that associates with a network of nuclear protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interactors and that PNUTS, a nuclear regulatory subunit of PP1, is phosphorylated by NUAK1. Both NUAK1 and PNUTS associate with the splicing machinery. Inhibition of NUAK1 abolishes chromatin association of PNUTS, reduces spliceosome activity, and suppresses nascent RNA synthesis. Activation of MYC does not bypass the requirement for NUAK1 for spliceosome activity but significantly attenuates transcription inhibition. Consequently, NUAK1 inhibition in MYC-transformed cells induces global accumulation of RNAPII both at the pause site and at the first exon-intron boundary but does not increase mRNA synthesis. We suggest that NUAK1 inhibition in the presence of deregulated MYC traps non-productive RNAPII because of the absence of correctly assembled spliceosomes."	1
"32049027"	"Nanoscale Remodeling of Functional Synaptic Vesicle Pools in Hebbian Plasticity.Vesicle pool properties are known determinants of synaptic efficacy, but their potential role as modifiable substrates in forms of Hebbian plasticity is still unclear. Here, we investigate this using a nanoscale readout of functionally recycled vesicles in natively wired hippocampal CA3→CA1 circuits undergoing long-term potentiation (LTP). We show that the total recycled vesicle pool is larger after plasticity induction, with the smallest terminals exhibiting the greatest relative expansion. Changes in the spatial organization of vesicles accompany potentiation including a specific increase in the number of recycled vesicles at the active zone, consistent with an ultrastructural remodeling component of synaptic strengthening. The cAMP-PKA pathway activator, forskolin, selectively mimics some features of LTP-driven changes, suggesting that distinct and independent modules of regulation accompany plasticity expression. Our findings provide evidence for a presynaptic locus of LTP encoded in the number and arrangement of functionally recycled vesicles, with relevance for models of long-term plasticity storage."	0
"32001512"	"Recurrent SRSF2 mutations in MDS affect both splicing and NMD.Oncogenic mutations in the RNA splicing factors SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 are the most frequent class of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and are also common in clonal hematopoiesis, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a variety of solid tumors. They cause genome-wide splicing alterations that affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and NMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2 mutants enhance the deposition of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated molecular interactions. This architecture then favors the association of key NMD factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of EJC deposition by antisense oligonucleotides circumvents aberrant NMD promoted by mutant SRSF2, restoring the expression of PTC-containing transcript. Our study uncovered critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies, reflecting the regulation at multiple levels of RNA metabolism, from splicing to decay."	0

Here we report structural and functional studies of human maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor suppressor lncRNA that modulates the p53 response. We found that, in an evolutionary conserved region of MEG3, two distal motifs interact by base complementarity to form alternative, mutually exclusive pseudoknot structures (""kissing loops""). Mutations that disrupt these interactions impair MEG3-dependent p53 stimulation in vivo and disrupt MEG3 folding in vitro. These findings provide mechanistic insights into regulation of the p53 pathway by MEG3 and reveal how conserved motifs of tertiary structure can regulate lncRNA biological function."	0

In this study, we show that CD137 signaling, specifically in intestinal CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs), restricts acute colitis progression. Mechanistically, CD137 engagement activates TAK1 and subsequently stimulates the AMPK-PGC-1α axis to enhance expression of the Aldh1a2 gene encoding the retinoic acid (RA) metabolizing enzyme RALDH2. RA can act on CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs and induce SOCS3 expression, which, in turn, suppresses p38MAPK activation and interleukin-23 (IL-23) production. Administration of RA in DC-specific CD137<sup>-/-</sup> mice represses IL-23-producing CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, indicating that RA is a major inhibitory effector molecule against intestinal CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs.

"32601061"	"Characterization of the nonheme iron center of cysteamine dioxygenase and its interaction with substrates.Cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) has been reported to exhibit two distinct biological functions with a nonheme iron center. It catalyzes oxidation of both cysteamine in sulfur metabolism and N-terminal cysteine-containing proteins or peptides, such as regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5). It thereby preserves oxygen homeostasis in a variety of physiological processes. However, little is known about its catalytic center and how it interacts with these two types of primary substrates in addition to O<sub>2</sub> Here, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mössbauer, and UV-visible spectroscopies, we explored the binding mode of cysteamine and RGS5 to human and mouse ADO proteins in their physiologically relevant ferrous form. This characterization revealed that in the presence of nitric oxide as a spin probe and oxygen surrogate, both the small molecule and the peptide substrates coordinate the iron center with their free thiols in a monodentate binding mode, in sharp contrast to binding behaviors observed in other thiol dioxygenases. We observed a substrate-bound B-type dinitrosyl iron center complex in ADO, suggesting the possibility of dioxygen binding to the iron ion in a side-on mode. Moreover, we observed substrate-mediated reduction of the iron center from ferric to the ferrous oxidation state. Subsequent MS analysis indicated corresponding disulfide formation of the substrates, suggesting that the presence of the substrate could reactivate ADO to defend against oxidative stress. The findings of this work contribute to the understanding of the substrate interaction in ADO and fill a gap in our knowledge of the substrate specificity of thiol dioxygenases."	0
"32846118"	"Antagonistic Interaction between Auxin and SA Signaling Pathways Regulates Bacterial Infection through Lateral Root in Arabidopsis.Pathogen entry into host tissues is a critical and first step in infections. In plants, the lateral roots (LRs) are a potential entry and colonization site for pathogens. Here, using a GFP-labeled pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pto DC3000), we observe that virulent Pto DC3000 invades plants through emerged LRs in Arabidopsis. Pto DC3000 strongly induced LR formation, a process that was dependent on the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19-LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN (LBD) regulatory module. We show that salicylic acid (SA) represses LR formation, and several mutants defective in SA signaling are also involved in Pto DC3000-induced LR development. Significantly, ARF7, a well-documented positive regulator of LR development, directly represses the transcription of PR1 and PR2 to promote LR development. This study indicates that ARF7-mediated auxin signaling antagonizes with SA signaling to control bacterial infection through the regulation of LR development."	1
"32381628"	"Transcriptional down-regulation of metabolic genes by Gdown1 ablation induces quiescent cell re-entry into the cell cycle.Liver regeneration and metabolism are highly interconnected. Here, we show that hepatocyte-specific ablation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated Gdown1 leads to down-regulation of highly expressed genes involved in plasma protein synthesis and metabolism, a concomitant cell cycle re-entry associated with induction of cell cycle-related genes (including <i>cyclin D1</i>), and up-regulation of <i>p21</i> through activation of p53 signaling. In the absence of p53, Gdown1-deficient hepatocytes show a severe dysregulation of cell cycle progression, with incomplete mitoses, and a premalignant-like transformation. Mechanistically, Gdown1 is associated with elongating Pol II on the highly expressed genes and its ablation leads to reduced Pol II recruitment to these genes, suggesting that Pol II redistribution may facilitate hepatocyte re-entry into the cell cycle. These results establish an important physiological function for a Pol II regulatory factor (Gdown1) in the maintenance of normal liver cell transcription through constraints on cell cycle re-entry of quiescent hepatocytes."	0

Here, we show that, in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, NvPOU4 is expressed in post-mitotic cells that give rise to a diverse set of neural cell types, including cnidocytes and NvElav1-expressing neurons. Morphological analyses of NvPOU4 mutants crossed to transgenic reporter lines show that the loss of NvPOU4 does not affect the initial specification of neural cells. Transcriptomes derived from the mutants and from different neural cell populations reveal that NvPOU4 is required for the execution of the terminal differentiation program of these neural cells. These findings suggest that POU4 genes have ancient functions as terminal selectors for morphologically and functionally disparate types of neurons and they provide experimental support for the relevance of terminal selectors for understanding the evolution of cell types."	0
"32348756"	"A Sparse, Spatially Biased Subtype of Mature Granule Cell Dominates Recruitment in Hippocampal-Associated Behaviors.Animals can store information about experiences by activating specific neuronal populations, and subsequent reactivation of these neural ensembles can lead to recall of salient experiences. In the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus participate in such memory engrams; however, whether there is an underlying logic to granule cell participation has not been examined. Here, we find that a range of novel experiences preferentially activates granule cells of the suprapyramidal blade relative to the infrapyramidal blade. Motivated by this, we identify a suprapyramidal-blade-enriched population of granule cells with distinct spatial, morphological, physiological, and developmental properties. Via transcriptomics, we map these traits onto a sparse and discrete granule cell subtype that is recruited at a 10-fold greater frequency than expected by subtype prevalence, constituting the majority of all recruited granule cells. Thus, in behaviors known to involve hippocampal-dependent memory formation, a rare and spatially localized subtype dominates overall granule cell recruitment."	0
"31447390"	"SLX4IP Antagonizes Promiscuous BLM Activity during ALT Maintenance.Cancer cells acquire unlimited proliferative capacity by either re-expressing telomerase or inducing alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which relies on telomere recombination. Here, we show that ALT recombination requires coordinate regulation of the SMX and BTR complexes to ensure the appropriate balance of resolution and dissolution activities at recombining telomeres. Critical to this control is SLX4IP, which accumulates at ALT telomeres and interacts with SLX4, XPF, and BLM. Loss of SLX4IP increases ALT-related phenotypes, which is incompatible with cell growth following concomitant loss of SLX4. Inactivation of BLM is sufficient to rescue telomere aggregation and the synthetic growth defect in this context, suggesting that SLX4IP favors SMX-dependent resolution by antagonizing promiscuous BLM activity during ALT recombination. Finally, we show that SLX4IP is inactivated in a subset of ALT-positive osteosarcomas. Collectively, our findings uncover an SLX4IP-dependent regulatory mechanism critical for telomere maintenance in ALT cancer cells."	0
"32647006"	"A kinase cascade on the yeast lysosomal vacuole regulates its membrane dynamics: conserved kinase Env7 is phosphorylated by casein kinase Yck3.Membrane fusion/fission is a highly dynamic and conserved process that responds to intra- and extracellular signals. Whereas the molecular machineries involved in membrane fusion/fission have been dissected, regulation of membrane dynamics remains poorly understood. The lysosomal vacuole of budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) has served as a seminal model in studies of membrane dynamics. We have previously established that yeast <i>ENV7</i> encodes an ortholog of STK16-related kinases that localizes to the vacuolar membrane and downregulates vacuolar membrane fusion. Additionally, we have previously reported that Env7 phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i> depends on <i>YCK3</i>, a gene that encodes a vacuolar membrane casein kinase I (CKI) homolog that nonredundantly functions in fusion regulation. Here, we report that Env7 physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by Yck3. We also establish that Env7 vacuole fusion/fission regulation and vacuolar localization are mediated through its Yck3-dependent phosphorylation. Through extensive site-directed mutagenesis, we map phosphorylation to the Env7 C terminus and confirm that Ser-331 is a primary and preferred phosphorylation site. Phospho-deficient Env7 mutants were defective in negative regulation of membrane fusion, increasing the number of prominent vacuoles, whereas a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-331 increased the number of fragmented vacuoles. Bioinformatics approaches confirmed that Env7 Ser-331 is within a motif that is highly conserved in STK16-related kinases and that it also anchors an SXXS CKI phosphorylation motif (<sub>328</sub>SRFS<sub>331</sub>). This study represents the first report on the regulatory mechanism of an STK16-related kinase. It also points to regulation of vacuolar membrane dynamics via a novel Yck3-Env7 kinase cascade."	1

"32209480"	"The Zonal Organization of Odorant Receptor Gene Choice in the Main Olfactory Epithelium of the Mouse.A mature olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) typically expresses one allele of one odorant receptor (OR) gene. It is widely thought that the great majority of the 1,141 intact mouse OR genes are expressed in one of four MOE zones (or bands or stripes), which are largely non-overlapping. Here, we develop a multiplex method to map, in 3D and MOE-wide, the expression areas of multiple OR genes in individual, non-genetically modified mice by three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, semi-automated image segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. We classify the expression areas of 68 OR genes into 9 zones. These zones are highly overlapping and strikingly complex when viewed in 3D reconstructions. There could well be more zones. We propose that zones reflect distinct OSN types that are each restricted in their choice to a subset of the OR gene repertoire."	0

We report that small T antigen in complex with MYCL and the EP400 complex activates the expression of LSD1 (KDM1A), RCOR2 and INSM1 to repress gene expression by the lineage transcription factor ATOH1. LSD1 inhibition reduces the growth of MCC in vitro and in vivo. Through a forward-genetics CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified an antagonistic relationship between LSD1 and the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) chromatin remodelling complex. Changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility caused by LSD1 inhibition were partially rescued by BRD9 inhibition, revealing that LSD1 and ncBAF antagonistically regulate an overlapping set of genes. Our work provides mechanistic insight into the dependence of MCC on LSD1 and a tumour suppressor role for ncBAF in cancer."	0
"30738704"	"Dual Role of Mitochondrial Porin in Metabolite Transport across the Outer Membrane and Protein Transfer to the Inner Membrane.The mitochondrial inner membrane harbors a large number of metabolite carriers. The precursors of carrier proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the carrier translocase of the inner membrane (TIM22). Molecular chaperones in the cytosol and intermembrane space bind to the hydrophobic precursors to prevent their aggregation. We report that the major metabolite channel of the outer membrane, termed porin or voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), promotes efficient import of carrier precursors. Porin interacts with carrier precursors arriving in the intermembrane space and recruits TIM22 complexes, thus ensuring an efficient transfer of the precursors to the inner membrane translocase. Porin channel mutants impaired in metabolite transport are not disturbed in carrier import into mitochondria. We conclude that porin serves distinct functions as outer membrane channel for metabolites and as coupling factor for protein translocation into the inner membrane."	0

Most of our understanding of Hippo signaling pertains to its cytoplasmic regulation, but how the pathway is controlled in the nucleus remains poorly understood. Here we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which CDK7 promotes Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization in the nucleus to sustain Hippo pathway outputs. We found that a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4<sup>DCAF12</sup> binds and targets Yki/Yap/Taz for ubiquitination and degradation, whereas CDK7 phosphorylates Yki/Yap/Taz at S169/S128/S90 to inhibit CRL4<sup>DCAF12</sup> recruitment, leading to Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization. As a consequence, inactivation of CDK7 reduced organ size and inhibited tumor growth, which could be reversed by restoring Yki/Yap activity. Our study identifies an unanticipated layer of Hippo pathway regulation, defines a novel mechanism by which CDK7 regulates tissue growth, and implies CDK7 as a drug target for Yap/Taz-driven cancer."	1

However, the pathogenesis of NASH is still unclear. Currently, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat this devastating disease. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) senses energy status and regulates metabolic processes to maintain homeostasis. The activity of AMPK is regulated by the availability of nutrients, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids. AMPK activity is increased by nutrient deprivation and inhibited by overnutrition, inflammation, and hypersecretion of certain anabolic hormones, such as insulin, during obesity. The repression of hepatic AMPK activity permits the transition from simple steatosis to hepatocellular death; thus, activation might ameliorate multiple aspects of NASH. Here we review the pathogenesis of NAFLD and the impact of AMPK activity state on hepatic steatosis, inflammation, liver injury, and fibrosis during the transition of NAFL to NASH and liver failure."	0

However, how maternally supplied transcripts are dynamically regulated during MZT remains largely unknown. Herein, through genome-wide profiling of RNA 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) modification in zebrafish early embryos, we found that m<sup>5</sup>C-modified maternal mRNAs display higher stability than non-m<sup>5</sup>C-modified mRNAs during MZT.

Shotgun sequencing of the skin microbiome demonstrates that lesional skin of NS subjects is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). Isolates of either species from NS subjects are able to induce skin inflammation and barrier damage on mice.

"32375036"	"Antagonistic Center-Surround Mechanisms for Direction Selectivity in the Retina.An antagonistic center-surround receptive field is a key feature in sensory processing, but how it contributes to specific computations such as direction selectivity is often unknown. Retinal On-starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which mediate direction selectivity in direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), exhibit antagonistic receptive field organization: depolarizing to light increments and decrements in their center and surround, respectively. We find that a repetitive stimulation exhausts SAC center and enhances its surround and use it to study how center-surround responses contribute to direction selectivity. Center, but not surround, activation induces direction-selective responses in SACs. Nevertheless, both SAC center and surround elicited direction-selective responses in DSGCs, but to opposite directions. Physiological and modeling data suggest that the opposing direction selectivity can result from inverted temporal balance between excitation and inhibition in DSGCs, implying that SAC's response timing dictates direction selectivity. Our findings reveal antagonistic center-surround mechanisms for direction selectivity and demonstrate how context-dependent receptive field reorganization enables flexible computations."	0
"32320660"	"The Asymmetric Expression of SAUR Genes Mediated by ARF7/19 Promotes the Gravitropism and Phototropism of Plant Hypocotyls.The asymmetric distribution of auxin leads to the bending growth of hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, but the signaling events downstream of auxin remain unclear. Here, we identify many SAUR genes showing asymmetric expression in soybean hypocotyls during gravistimulation and then study their homologs in Arabidopsis. SAUR19 subfamily genes have asymmetric expression in Arabidopsis hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, induced by the lateral redistribution of auxin. Both the mutation of SAUR19 subfamily genes and the ectopic expression of SAUR19 weaken these tropic responses, indicating the critical role of their asymmetric expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor ARF7 may directly bind the SAUR19 promoter and activate SAUR19 expression asymmetrically in tropic responses. Taken together, our results reveal that a gravity- or light-triggered asymmetric auxin distribution induces the asymmetric expression of SAUR19 subfamily genes by ARF7 and ARF19 in the hypocotyls, which leads to bending growth during gravitropic and phototropic responses."	1

We employed metabolic small RNA sequencing for a comprehensive view on intracellular microRNA kinetics in Drosophila. Based on absolute rate of biogenesis and decay, microRNAs rank among the fastest produced and longest-lived cellular transcripts, disposing up to 10<sup>5</sup> copies per cell at steady-state. Mature microRNAs are produced within minutes, revealing tight intracellular coupling of biogenesis that is selectively disrupted by pre-miRNA-uridylation. Control over Argonaute protein homeostasis generates a kinetic bottleneck that cooperates with non-coding RNA surveillance to ensure faithful microRNA loading. Finally, regulated small RNA decay enables the selective rapid turnover of Ago1-bound microRNAs, but not of Ago2-bound small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), reflecting key differences in the robustness of small RNA silencing pathways.

Here, we generate mutant human embryonic stem cell lines (Mut hESCs) carrying an NR2F1-R112K mutation that has been identified in a patient with ASD features and investigate their neurodevelopmental alterations. Mut hESCs overproduce ventral telencephalic neuron progenitors (ventral NPCs) and underproduce dorsal NPCs, causing the imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurons. These alterations can be mainly attributed to the aberrantly activated Hedgehog signaling pathway. Moreover, the corresponding Nr2f1 point-mutant mice display a similar excitatory/inhibitory neuron imbalance and abnormal behaviors. Antagonizing the increased inhibitory synaptic transmission partially alleviates their behavioral deficits. Together, our results suggest that the NR2F1-dependent imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neuron differentiation caused by the activated Hedgehog pathway is one precursor of neurodevelopmental disorders and may enlighten the therapeutic approaches."	0
"32755586"	"Inhibition of MEK1/2 Forestalls the Onset of Acquired Resistance to Entrectinib in Multiple Models of NTRK1-Driven Cancer.NTRK1 gene fusions are actionable drivers of numerous human malignancies. Here, we show that expression of the TPR-NTRK1 fusion kinase in immortalized mouse pancreatic ductal epithelial (IMPE) (pancreas) or mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells is sufficient to promote rapidly growing tumors in mice. Both tumor models are exquisitely sensitive to targeted inhibition with entrectinib, a tropomyosin-related kinase A (TRKA) inhibitor. Initial regression of NTRK1-driven tumors is driven by induced expression of BIM, such that BIM silencing leads to a diminished response to entrectinib in vivo. However, the emergence of drug-resistant disease limits the long-term durability of responses. Based on the reactivation of RAF>MEK>ERK signaling observed in entrectinib-treated tumors, we show that the combination of entrectinib plus the MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib dramatically forestalls the onset of drug resistance in vivo. Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic rationale for rapid clinical deployment of combined inhibition of TRKA plus MEK1/2 in NTRK1-driven cancers."	0
"32868903"	"Ferroptosis occurs through an osmotic mechanism and propagates independently of cell rupture.Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that is caused by the accumulation of oxidized phospholipids, leading to membrane damage and cell lysis<sup>1,2</sup>. Although other types of necrotic death such as pyroptosis and necroptosis are mediated by active mechanisms of execution<sup>3-6</sup>, ferroptosis is thought to result from the accumulation of unrepaired cell damage<sup>1</sup>. Previous studies have suggested that ferroptosis has the ability to spread through cell populations in a wave-like manner, resulting in a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of cell death<sup>7,8</sup>. Here we investigate the mechanism of ferroptosis execution and discover that ferroptotic cell rupture is mediated by plasma membrane pores, similarly to cell lysis in pyroptosis and necroptosis<sup>3,4</sup>. We further find that intercellular propagation of death occurs following treatment with some ferroptosis-inducing agents, including erastin<sup>2,9</sup> and C' dot nanoparticles<sup>8</sup>, but not upon direct inhibition of the ferroptosis-inhibiting enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)<sup>10</sup>. Propagation of a ferroptosis-inducing signal occurs upstream of cell rupture and involves the spreading of a cell swelling effect through cell populations in a lipid peroxide- and iron-dependent manner."	0
"31706702"	"The Biogenesis of SRP RNA Is Modulated by an RNA Folding Intermediate Attained during Transcription.The signal recognition particle (SRP), responsible for co-translational protein targeting and delivery to cellular membranes, depends on the native long-hairpin fold of its RNA to confer functionality. Since RNA initiates folding during its synthesis, we used high-resolution optical tweezers to follow in real time the co-transcriptional folding of SRP RNA. Surprisingly, SRP RNA folding is robust to transcription rate changes and the presence or absence of its 5'-precursor sequence. The folding pathway also reveals the obligatory attainment of a non-native hairpin intermediate (H1) that eventually rearranges into the native fold. Furthermore, H1 provides a structural platform alternative to the native fold for RNase P to bind and mature SRP RNA co-transcriptionally. Delays in attaining the final native fold are detrimental to the cell, altogether showing that a co-transcriptional folding pathway underpins the proper biogenesis of function-essential SRP RNA."	0
"32610038"	"The Configuration of RPA, RAD51, and DMC1 Binding in Meiosis Reveals the Nature of Critical Recombination Intermediates.Meiotic recombination proceeds via binding of RPA, RAD51, and DMC1 to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates created after formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks. Here we report high-resolution in vivo maps of RPA and RAD51 in meiosis, mapping their binding locations and lifespans to individual homologous chromosomes using a genetically engineered hybrid mouse. Together with high-resolution microscopy and DMC1 binding maps, we show that DMC1 and RAD51 have distinct spatial localization on ssDNA: DMC1 binds near the break site, and RAD51 binds away from it. We characterize inter-homolog recombination intermediates bound by RPA in vivo, with properties expected for the critical displacement loop (D-loop) intermediates. These data support the hypothesis that DMC1, not RAD51, performs strand exchange in mammalian meiosis. RPA-bound D-loops can be resolved as crossovers or non-crossovers, but crossover-destined D-loops may have longer lifespans. D-loops resemble crossover gene conversions in size, but their extent is similar in both repair pathways."	0

Its emergence into the human population and ensuing pandemic came on the heels of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two other highly pathogenic coronavirus spillovers, which collectively have reshaped our view of a virus family previously associated primarily with the common cold. It has placed intense pressure on the collective scientific community to develop therapeutics and vaccines, whose engineering relies on a detailed understanding of coronavirus biology. Here, we present the molecular virology of coronavirus infection, including its entry into cells, its remarkably sophisticated gene expression and replication mechanisms, its extensive remodeling of the intracellular environment, and its multifaceted immune evasion strategies. We highlight aspects of the viral life cycle that may be amenable to antiviral targeting as well as key features of its biology that await discovery."	0

The transcription start site nucleotide is ribose methylated (Nm) in many eukaryotes, whereas an adenosine at this position is further methylated at the N<sup>6</sup> position (m<sup>6</sup>A) by the mammalian Phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting Factor 1 (PCIF1) to generate m<sup>6</sup>Am. Here, we show that although the loss of cap-specific m<sup>6</sup>Am in mice does not affect viability or fertility, the Pcif1 mutants display reduced body weight. Transcriptome analyses of mutant mouse tissues support a role for the cap-specific m<sup>6</sup>Am modification in stabilizing transcripts. In contrast, the Drosophila Pcif1 is catalytically dead, but like its mammalian counterpart, it retains the ability to associate with the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II).

"32268106"	"T Cell Factor 1 Suppresses CD103+ Lung Tissue-Resident Memory T Cell Development.T cell factor 1 (Tcf1) promotes the central memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cell differentiation and stemness in lymphoid tissues after systemic infections. It remains unclear whether Tcf1 regulates the CD103<sup>high</sup> tissue-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cell formation in non-lymphoid tissues after mucosal infections. We find that Tcf1 is progressively decreased during lung T<sub>RM</sub> cell formation. Abrogation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is associated with a loss of CD103<sup>+</sup> and reciprocal gain of Tcf1<sup>+</sup> cells among T<sub>RM</sub> precursors in vivo. T-cell-specific ablation of Tcf7 enhances CD103 protein expression in T<sub>RM</sub> cells and precursors and increases T<sub>RM</sub> cell numbers after primary and secondary infections. Tcf1 directly binds to the Itgae (encoding CD103) locus and partly inhibits TGF-β-induced CD103 expression. Our study suggests that memory T cell tissue residency and homeostatic proliferation are reciprocally regulated by Tcf1. Tcf1 may play either immunosupportive or immunosuppressive roles in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, depending on systemic or mucosal infections."	1
"32937137"	"LIM-Homeodomain Transcription Factor LHX4 Is Required for the Differentiation of Retinal Rod Bipolar Cells and OFF-Cone Bipolar Subtypes.Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) connect with photoreceptors and relay visual information to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Retina-specific deletion of Lhx4 in mice results in a visual defect resembling human congenital stationary night blindness. This visual dysfunction results from the absence of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and the loss of selective rod-connecting cone bipolar cell (CBC) subtypes and AII amacrine cells (ACs). Inactivation of Lhx4 causes the apoptosis of BCs and cell fate switch from some BCs to ACs, whereas Lhx4 overexpression promotes BC genesis. Moreover, Lhx4 positively regulates Lhx3 expression to drive the fate choice of type 2 BCs over the GABAergic ACs. Lhx4 inactivation ablates Bhlhe23 expression, whereas overexpression of Bhlhe23 partially rescues RBC development in the absence of Lhx4. Thus, by acting upstream of Bhlhe23, Prdm8, Fezf2, Lhx3, and other BC genes, Lhx4, together with Isl1, could play essential roles in regulating the subtype-specific development of RBCs and CBCs."	0
"32209468"	"The Absence of HIF-1α Increases Susceptibility to Leishmania donovani Infection via Activation of BNIP3/mTOR/SREBP-1c Axis.Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is considered a global regulator of cellular metabolism and innate immune cell functions. Intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania have been reported to manipulate host cell metabolism. Herein, we demonstrate that myeloid cells from myeloid-restricted HIF-1α-deficient mice and individuals with loss-of-function HIF1A gene polymorphisms are more susceptible to L. donovani infection through increased lipogenesis. Absence of HIF-1α leads to a defect in BNIP3 expression, resulting in the activation of mTOR and nuclear translocation of SREBP-1c. We observed the induction of lipogenic gene transcripts, such as FASN, and lipid accumulation in infected HIF-1α<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages. L. donovani-infected HIF-1α-deficient mice develop hypertriglyceridemia and lipid accumulation in splenic and hepatic myeloid cells. Most importantly, our data demonstrate that manipulating FASN or SREBP-1c using pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced parasite burden. As such, genetic deficiency of HIF-1α is associated with increased lipid accumulation, which results in impaired host-protective anti-leishmanial functions of myeloid cells."	0
"32268091"	"A Two-Cell Model for IL-1β Release Mediated by Death-Receptor Signaling.Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key orchestrator of anti-microbial immunity whose secretion is typically dependent on activation of inflammasomes. However, many pathogens have evolved strategies to evade inflammasome activation. Here we describe an alternative, two-cell model for IL-1β release where invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells use the death receptor pathway to instruct antigen-presenting cells to secrete IL-1β. Following cognate interactions with TLR-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), iNKT cells rapidly translocate intracellular Fas ligand to the surface to engage Fas on BMDCs. Fas ligation activates a caspase-8-dependent signaling cascade in BMDCs that drives IL-1β release largely independent of inflammasomes. The apoptotic program initiated by Fas ligation rapidly transitions into a pyroptosis-like form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D. Together, our findings support a two-cell model for IL-1β secretion that may supersede inflammasome activation when cytosolic triggers fail."	0
"32023465"	"Dynamics of the Coreceptor-LCK Interactions during T Cell Development Shape the Self-Reactivity of Peripheral CD4 and CD8 T Cells.Overtly self-reactive T cells are removed during thymic selection. However, it has been recently established that T cell self-reactivity promotes protective immune responses. Apparently, the level of self-reactivity of mature T cells must be tightly balanced. Our mathematical model and experimental data show that the dynamic regulation of CD4- and CD8-LCK coupling establish the self-reactivity of the peripheral T cell pool. The stoichiometry of the interaction between CD8 and LCK, but not between CD4 and LCK, substantially increases upon T cell maturation. As a result, peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are more self-reactive than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The different levels of self-reactivity of mature CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells likely reflect the unique roles of these subsets in immunity. These results indicate that the evolutionary selection pressure tuned the CD4-LCK and CD8-LCK stoichiometries, as they represent the unique parts of the proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, which differ between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells."	0
"31759821"	"Fork Cleavage-Religation Cycle and Active Transcription Mediate Replication Restart after Fork Stalling at Co-transcriptional R-Loops.Formation of co-transcriptional R-loops underlies replication fork stalling upon head-on transcription-replication encounters. Here, we demonstrate that RAD51-dependent replication fork reversal induced by R-loops is followed by the restart of semiconservative DNA replication mediated by RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases, MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, RAD52 strand-annealing factor, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)/XRCC4 complex, and the non-catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, POLD3. RECQ5 disrupts RAD51 filaments assembled on stalled forks after RECQ1-mediated reverse branch migration, preventing a new round of fork reversal and facilitating fork cleavage by MUS81/EME1. MUS81-dependent DNA breaks accumulate in cells lacking RAD52 or LIG4 upon induction of R-loop formation, suggesting that RAD52 acts in concert with LIG4/XRCC4 to catalyze fork religation, thereby mediating replication restart. The resumption of DNA synthesis after R-loop-associated fork stalling also requires active transcription, the restoration of which depends on MUS81, RAD52, LIG4, and the transcription elongation factor ELL. These findings provide mechanistic insights into transcription-replication conflict resolution."	0
"32822587"	"Functional Interplay between Histone H2B ADP-Ribosylation and Phosphorylation Controls Adipogenesis.Although ADP-ribosylation of histones by PARP-1 has been linked to genotoxic stress responses, its role in physiological processes and gene expression has remained elusive. We found that NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B-Glu35 by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-activated PARP-1 inhibits AMP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of adjacent H2B-Ser36, which is required for the proadipogenic gene expression program. The activity of PARP-1 on H2B requires NMNAT-1, a nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> synthase, which directs PARP-1 catalytic activity to Glu and Asp residues. ADP-ribosylation of Glu35 and the subsequent reduction of H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation inhibits the differentiation of adipocyte precursors in cultured cells. Parp1 knockout in preadipocytes in a mouse lineage-tracing genetic model increases adipogenesis, leading to obesity. Collectively, our results demonstrate a functional interplay between H2B-Glu35 ADP-ribosylation and H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation that controls adipogenesis."	1
"31668496"	"The NADH Dehydrogenase Nde1 Executes Cell Death after Integrating Signals from Metabolism and Proteostasis on the Mitochondrial Surface.The proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to gain a global overview of mitochondrial protein turnover in yeast cells. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally high turnover of the NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor, AIF, forms two distinct topomers in mitochondria, one residing in the intermembrane space while the other spans the outer membrane and is exposed to the cytosol. The surface-exposed topomer triggers cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome/Cdc48 system and the mitochondrial protease Yme1; however, it is strongly enriched in respiratory-deficient cells. Our data suggest that in addition to their role in electron transfer, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases such as Nde1 or AIF integrate signals from energy metabolism and cytosolic proteostasis to eliminate compromised cells from growing populations."	0
"32209467"	"Acute Plasmodium Infection Promotes Interferon-Gamma-Dependent Resistance to Ebola Virus Infection.During the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic, a significant number of patients admitted to Ebola treatment units were co-infected with Plasmodium falciparum, a predominant agent of malaria. However, there is no consensus on how malaria impacts EBOV infection. The effect of acute Plasmodium infection on EBOV challenge was investigated using mouse-adapted EBOV and a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) model virus. We demonstrate that acute Plasmodium infection protects from lethal viral challenge, dependent upon interferon gamma (IFN-γ) elicited as a result of parasite infection. Plasmodium-infected mice lacking the IFN-γ receptor are not protected. Ex vivo incubation of naive human or mouse macrophages with sera from acutely parasitemic rodents or macaques programs a proinflammatory phenotype dependent on IFN-γ and renders cells resistant to EBOV infection. We conclude that acute Plasmodium infection can safeguard against EBOV by the production of protective IFN-γ. These findings have implications for anti-malaria therapies administered during episodic EBOV outbreaks in Africa."	0
"31006537"	"TEX264 Is an Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident ATG8-Interacting Protein Critical for ER Remodeling during Nutrient Stress.Cells respond to nutrient stress by trafficking cytosolic contents to lysosomes for degradation via macroautophagy. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an initiation site for autophagosomes and is also remodeled in response to nutrient stress through ER-phagy, a form of selective autophagy. Quantitative proteome analysis during nutrient stress identified an unstudied single-pass transmembrane ER protein, TEX264, as an ER-phagy receptor. TEX264 uses an LC3-interacting region (LIR) to traffic into ATG8-positive puncta that often initiate from three-way ER tubule junctions and subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Interaction and proximity biotinylation proteomics identified a cohort of autophagy regulatory proteins and cargo adaptors located near TEX264 in an LIR-dependent manner. Global proteomics and ER-phagy flux analysis revealed the stabilization of a cohort of ER proteins in TEX264<sup>-/-</sup> cells during nutrient stress. This work reveals TEX264 as an unrecognized ER-phagy receptor that acts independently of other candidate ER-phagy receptors to remodel the ER during nutrient stress."	0

The classical-PRE state ribosome structure reveals a previously unobserved interaction between the C-terminal region of the conserved ribosomal protein uS19 and the A- and P-site tRNAs and the mRNA in the decoding site. In addition to changes in the inter-subunit bridges, analysis of different ribosomal conformations reveals the dynamic nature of this domain and suggests a role in tRNA accommodation and translocation during elongation. Furthermore, we show that disease-associated mutations in uS19 result in increased frameshifting. Together, this structure-function analysis provides mechanistic insights into the role of the uS19 C-terminal tail in the context of mammalian ribosomes."	0
"31003868"	"tRNA Maturation Defects Lead to Inhibition of rRNA Processing via Synthesis of pppGpp.rRNAs and tRNAs universally require processing from longer primary transcripts to become functional for translation. Here, we describe an unsuspected link between tRNA maturation and the 3' processing of 16S rRNA, a key step in preparing the small ribosomal subunit for interaction with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotic translation initiation. We show that an accumulation of either 5' or 3' immature tRNAs triggers RelA-dependent production of the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The accumulation of (p)ppGpp and accompanying decrease in GTP levels specifically inhibit 16S rRNA 3' maturation.

"32571874"	"The bacterial copper resistance protein CopG contains a cysteine-bridged tetranuclear copper cluster.CopG is an uncharacterized protein ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria whose gene frequently occurs in clusters of copper resistance genes and can be recognized by the presence of a conserved CxCC motif. To investigate its contribution to copper resistance, here we undertook a structural and biochemical characterization of the CopG protein from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Results from biochemical analyses of CopG purified under aerobic conditions indicate that it is a green copper-binding protein that displays absorbance maxima near 411, 581, and 721 nm and is monomeric in solution. Determination of the three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography revealed that CopG consists of a thioredoxin domain with a C-terminal extension that contributes to metal binding. We noted that adjacent to the CxCC motif is a cluster of four copper ions bridged by cysteine sulfur atoms. Structures of CopG in two oxidation states support the assignment of this protein as an oxidoreductase. On the basis of these structural and spectroscopic findings and also genetic evidence, we propose that CopG has a role in interconverting Cu(I) and Cu(II) to minimize toxic effects and facilitate export by the Cus RND transporter efflux system."	0
"32610127"	"The AP1 Transcription Factor Fosl2 Promotes Systemic Autoimmunity and Inflammation by Repressing Treg Development.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a major population in the control of immune homeostasis and autoimmunity. Here we show that Fos-like 2 (Fosl2), a TCR-induced AP1 transcription factor, represses Treg development and controls autoimmunity. Mice overexpressing Fosl2 (Fosl2<sup>tg</sup>) indeed show a systemic inflammatory phenotype, with immune infiltrates in multiple organs. This phenotype is absent in Fosl2<sup>tg</sup> × Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice lacking T and B cells, and Fosl2 induces T cell-intrinsic reduction of Treg development that is responsible for the inflammatory phenotype. Fosl2<sup>tg</sup> T cells can transfer inflammation, which is suppressed by the co-delivery of Tregs, while Fosl2 deficiency in T cells reduces the severity of autoimmunity in the EAE model.

"32268085"	"Loss of Thymine DNA Glycosylase Causes Dysregulation of Bile Acid Homeostasis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that plays an essential role in the maintenance of epigenetic stability in cells. Here, we demonstrate that the conditional deletion of TDG in adult mice results in a male-predominant onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TDG loss leads to a prediabetic state, as well as bile acid (BA) accumulation in the liver and serum of male mice. Consistent with these data, TDG deletion led to dysregulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulatory cascade in the liver. FXR and SHP are tumor suppressors of HCC and play an essential role in BA and glucose homeostasis. These results indicate that TDG functions as a tumor suppressor of HCC by regulating a transcriptional program that protects against the development of glucose intolerance and BA accumulation in the liver."	0

Their dysfunction is linked to cancer and developmental disorders. Here, we identify CCDC57 as a pleiotropic regulator of centriole duplication, mitosis, and ciliogenesis. Combining proximity mapping with superresolution imaging, we show that CCDC57 localizes to the proximal end of centrioles and interacts with the microcephaly protein CEP63, centriolar satellite proteins, and microtubules. Loss of CCDC57 causes defects in centriole duplication and results in a failure to localize CEP63 and CEP152 to the centrosome. Additionally, CCDC57 depletion perturbs mitotic progression both in wild-type and centriole-less cells. Importantly, its centrosome-targeting region is required for its interaction with CEP63 and functions during centriole duplication and cilium assembly, whereas the microtubule-targeting region is required for its mitotic functions. Together, our results identify CCDC57 as a critical interface between centrosome and microtubule-mediated cellular processes that are deregulated in microcephaly."	1

At least two independent subcomplexes exist, defined by their specific accessory proteins: PRC2.1 (PCL1-3, EPOP, and PALI1/2) and PRC2.2 (AEBP2 and JARID2). We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1-3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms."	0

H<sub>2</sub> formation is catalyzed by a biologically unique hexanuclear iron cofactor denoted the H-cluster. The assembly of this cofactor requires a dedicated maturation machinery including HydF, a multidomain [4Fe4S] cluster protein with GTPase activity. HydF is responsible for harboring and delivering a precatalyst to the apo-hydrogenase, but the details of this process are not well understood. Here, we utilize gas-phase electrophoretic macromolecule analysis to show that a HydF dimer forms a transient interaction complex with the hydrogenase and that the formation of this complex depends on the cofactor content on HydF. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance, and UV-visible spectroscopy studies of mutants of HydF show that the isolated iron-sulfur cluster domain retains the capacity for binding the precatalyst in a reversible fashion and is capable of activating apo-hydrogenase in <i>in vitro</i> assays.

Diseases like osteoporosis are characterized by increased bone destruction due to partially enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Here, we report that the post-translational SUMO modification is critical for regulating osteoclastogenesis. The expression of the SUMO-specific protease SENP3 is downregulated in osteoclast precursors during osteoclast differentiation. Mice with SENP3 deficiency in bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) exhibit more severe bone loss due to over-activation of osteoclasts after ovariectomy. Deleting SENP3 in BMDMs promotes osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, loss of SENP3 increases interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) SUMO3 modification at the K310 amino acid site, which upregulates expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cell c1 (NFATc1) and osteoclastogenesis. In summary, IRF8 de-SUMO modification mediated by SENP3 suppresses osteoclast differentiation and suggests strategies to treat bone loss diseases."	1

To examine these interactions, we summarize the population partial pairwise correlation structure as a directed and weighted graph. We find that tuned and untuned neurons have distinct topological properties, with untuned neurons occupying central positions in functional networks (FNs). Implementation of a decoder that utilizes the topology of these FNs yields accurate decoding of visual stimuli. We further show that decoding performance degrades comparably following manipulations of either tuned or untuned neurons. Our results demonstrate that untuned neurons are an integral component of V1 FNs and suggest that network interactions contain information about the stimulus that is accessible to downstream elements."	0

These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid, yet they are infectious, allowing them to act as a protein-based epigenetic element: a prion [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. Our data establish that non-amyloid self-assembly of RNA-binding proteins can drive a form of epigenetics beyond the chromosome, instilling adaptive gene expression programs that are heritable over long biological timescales."	0
"31128943"	"RNA Targets Ribogenesis Factor WDR43 to Chromatin for Transcription and Pluripotency Control.Transcription regulation underlies stem cell function and development. Here, we elucidate an unexpected role of an essential ribogenesis factor, WDR43, as a chromatin-associated RNA-binding protein (RBP) and release factor in modulating the polymerase (Pol) II activity for pluripotency regulation. WDR43 binds prominently to promoter-associated noncoding/nascent RNAs, occupies thousands of gene promoters and enhancers, and interacts with the Pol II machinery in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Nascent transcripts and transcription recruit WDR43 to active promoters, where WDR43 facilitates releases of the elongation factor P-TEFb and paused Pol II. Knockdown of WDR43 causes genome-wide defects in Pol II release and pluripotency-associated gene expression. Importantly, auxin-mediated rapid degradation of WDR43 drastically reduces Pol II activity, precluding indirect consequences. These results reveal an RNA-mediated recruitment and feedforward regulation on transcription and demonstrate an unforeseen role of an RBP in promoting Pol II elongation and coordinating high-level transcription and translation in ESC pluripotency."	0
"32645369"	"RNF126-Mediated Reubiquitination Is Required for Proteasomal Degradation of p97-Extracted Membrane Proteins.Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is an AAA-ATPase that extracts polyubiquitinated substrates from multimeric macromolecular complexes and biological membranes for proteasomal degradation. During p97-mediated extraction, the substrate is largely deubiquitinated as it is threaded through the p97 central pore. How p97-extracted substrates are targeted to the proteasome with few or no ubiquitins is unknown. Here, we report that p97-extracted membrane proteins undergo a second round of ubiquitination catalyzed by the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase RNF126. RNF126 interacts with transmembrane-domain-specific chaperone BAG6, which captures p97-liberated substrates. RNF126 depletion in cells diminishes the ubiquitination of extracted membrane proteins, slows down their turnover, and dramatically stabilizes otherwise transient intermediates in the cytosol. We reconstitute the reubiquitination of a p97-extracted, misfolded multispanning membrane protein with purified factors. Our results demonstrate that p97-extracted substrates need to rapidly engage ubiquitin ligase-chaperone pairs that rebuild the ubiquitin signal for proteasome targeting to prevent harmful accumulation of unfolded intermediates."	1
"32783928"	"Efficient Strategies for Microglia Replacement in the Central Nervous System.Microglia are important immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunctions of gene-deficient microglia contribute to the development and progression of multiple CNS diseases. Microglia replacement by nonself cells has been proposed to treat microglia-associated disorders. However, some attempts have failed due to low replacement efficiency, such as with the traditional bone marrow transplantation approach. In this study, we develop three efficient strategies for microglia replacement: microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (mrBMT), microglia replacement by peripheral blood (mrPB), and microglia replacement by microglia transplantation (mrMT). mrBMT and mrPB allow microglia-like cells to efficiently replace resident microglia in the whole CNS. On the other hand, mrMT achieves microglia replacement in brain regions of interest. In summary, the present study offers effective tactics for microglia replacement with diverse application scenarios, which potentially opens up a window on treating microglia-associated CNS disorders."	0
"31420216"	"Estrogen-Related Hormones Induce Apoptosis by Stabilizing Schlafen-12 Protein Turnover.The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is controlled by the ratio of anti- and pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The molecular events underlying how a given physiological stimulus changes this ratio to trigger apoptosis remains unclear. We report here that human 17-β-estradiol (E2) and its related steroid hormones induce apoptosis by binding directly to phosphodiesterase 3A, which in turn recruits and stabilizes an otherwise fast-turnover protein Schlafen 12 (SLFN12). The elevated SLFN12 binds to ribosomes to exclude the recruitment of signal recognition particles (SRPs), thereby blocking the continuous protein translation occurring on the endoplasmic reticulum of E2-treated cells. These proteins include Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, whose ensuing decrease triggers apoptosis. The SLFN12 protein and an apoptosis activation marker were co-localized in syncytiotrophoblast of human placentas, where levels of estrogen-related hormones are high, and dynamic cell turnover by apoptosis is critical for successful implantation and placenta development."	1
