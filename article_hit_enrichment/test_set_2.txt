"32698014"	"Tissue-Specific Regulation of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway by PAGE4 Inhibition of Tankyrase.Spatiotemporal control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critical for organism development and homeostasis. The poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase Tankyrase (TNKS1) promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling through PARylation-mediated degradation of AXIN1, a component of the β-catenin destruction complex. Although Wnt/β-catenin is a niche-restricted signaling program, tissue-specific factors that regulate TNKS1 are not known. Here, we report prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) as a tissue-specific TNKS1 inhibitor that robustly represses canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human cells, zebrafish, and mice. Structural and biochemical studies reveal that PAGE4 acts as an optimal substrate decoy that potently hijacks substrate binding sites on TNKS1 to prevent AXIN1 PARylation and degradation. Consistently, transgenic expression of PAGE4 in mice phenocopies TNKS1 knockout. Physiologically, PAGE4 is selectively expressed in stromal prostate fibroblasts and functions to establish a proper Wnt/β-catenin signaling niche through suppression of autocrine signaling. Our findings reveal a non-canonical mechanism for TNKS1 inhibition that functions to establish tissue-specific control of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."	1
"32521278"	"Enhancer-Driven lncRNA BDNF-AS Induces Endocrine Resistance and Malignant Progression of Breast Cancer through the RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR Cascade.Epigenomic alterations can give rise to various tumor-promoting properties, including therapeutic resistance of cancer cells. Here, we identify an lncRNA, BDNF-AS, whose overexpression is specifically driven by a MEF2A-regulated enhancer in endocrine-resistant and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High levels of BDNF-AS in breast cancer tissues not only feature endocrine resistance in hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients but also correlate with poor outcomes in both HR-positive and TNBC patients. Mechanistically, BDNF-AS acts as a molecular scaffold to promote RNH1 protein degradation via TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of RNH1 at K225. Subsequently, BDNF-AS abolishes RNH1-regulated and RISC-mediated mTOR mRNA decay, therefore sustaining the activation of mTOR signaling. Importantly, mTOR inhibitor, but not PI3K inhibitor, could reverse tamoxifen resistance induced by the overexpression of BDNF-AS. These results point toward a master regulatory role of an enhancer-activated cascade of BDNF-AS/RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR in endocrine resistance and malignant progression of breast cancer."	1
"32814047"	"Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2S Enhances Viral Replication by Inhibiting Type I IFN Production through Recruiting USP15 to Deubiquitinate TBK1.Type I interferon (IFN) plays an essential role in the host innate immune responses. Several ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) family members were reported to regulate type I IFN production and host antiviral immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we report that UBE2S acts as a negative regulator in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of UBE2S inhibits host antiviral immune responses and enhances viral replications, whereas deficiency of UBE2S enhances host antiviral immune responses and suppresses viral replications both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of type І IFN production by UBE2S is independent on its E2 and E3 enzymic activity. Mechanistically, UBE2S interacts with TBK1 and recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) to remove Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains of TBK1. Our findings reveal a role of the UBE2S-USP15-TBK1 axis in the regulation of host antiviral innate immune responses."	1
"32571881"	"MtcB, a member of the MttB superfamily from the human gut acetogen <i>Eubacterium limosum</i>, is a cobalamin-dependent carnitine demethylase.The trimethylamine methyltransferase MttB is the first described member of a superfamily comprising thousands of microbial proteins. Most members of the MttB superfamily are encoded by genes that lack the codon for pyrrolysine characteristic of trimethylamine methyltransferases, raising questions about the activities of these proteins. The superfamily member MtcB is found in the human intestinal isolate <i>Eubacterium limosum</i> ATCC 8486, an acetogen that can grow by demethylation of l-carnitine. Here, we demonstrate that MtcB catalyzes l-carnitine demethylation. When growing on l-carnitine, <i>E. limosum</i> excreted the unusual biological product norcarnitine as well as acetate, butyrate, and caproate. Cellular extracts of <i>E. limosum</i> grown on l-carnitine, but not lactate, methylated cob-(I)alamin or tetrahydrofolate using l-carnitine as methyl donor. MtcB, along with the corrinoid protein MtqC and the methylcorrinoid:tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase MtqA, were much more abundant in <i>E. limosum</i> cells grown on l-carnitine than on lactate. Recombinant MtcB methylates either cob(I)alamin or Co(I)-MtqC in the presence of l-carnitine and, to a much lesser extent, γ-butyrobetaine. Other quaternary amines were not substrates. Recombinant MtcB, MtqC, and MtqA methylated tetrahydrofolate via l-carnitine, forming a key intermediate in the acetogenic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. To our knowledge, MtcB methylation of cobalamin or Co(I)-MtqC represents the first described mechanism of biological l-carnitine demethylation. The conversion of l-carnitine and its derivative γ-butyrobetaine to trimethylamine by the gut microbiome has been linked to cardiovascular disease. The activities of MtcB and related proteins in <i>E. limosum</i> might demethylate proatherogenic quaternary amines and contribute to the perceived health benefits of this human gut symbiont."	0
"32049028"	"Opposing Regulation of Cocaine Seeking by Glutamate and GABA Neurons in the Ventral Pallidum.Projections from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum (VP) regulate relapse in animal models of addiction. The VP contains GABAergic (VP<sub>GABA</sub>) and glutamatergic (VP<sub>Glu</sub>) neurons, and a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons co-express enkephalin (VP<sub>Penk</sub>). Rabies tracing reveals that VP<sub>Glu</sub> and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons receive preferential innervation from upstream D1- relative to D2-expressing accumbens neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons inhibits, whereas stimulation of VP<sub>GABA</sub> and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons potentiates cocaine seeking in mice withdrawn from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Calcium imaging reveals cell type-specific activity patterns when animals learn to suppress drug seeking during extinction training versus engaging in cue-induced cocaine seeking. During cued seeking, VP<sub>GABA</sub> neurons increase their overall activity, and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons are selectively activated around nose pokes for cocaine. In contrast, VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons increase their spike rate following extinction training. These data show that VP subpopulations differentially encode and regulate cocaine seeking, with VP<sub>Penk</sub> and VP<sub>GABA</sub> neurons facilitating and VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons inhibiting cocaine seeking."	0
"30704899"	"Pacer Is a Mediator of mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 Signaling in Regulation of Autophagosome Maturation and Lipid Metabolism.mTORC1 and GSK3 play critical roles in early stages of (macro)autophagy, but how they regulate late steps of autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 signaling converge to modulate autophagosome maturation through Pacer, an autophagy regulator that was identified in our recent study. Hepatocyte-specific Pacer knockout in mice results in impaired autophagy flux, glycogen and lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates Pacer at serine157 to disrupt the association of Pacer with Stx17 and the HOPS complex and thus abolishes Pacer-mediated autophagosome maturation. Importantly, dephosphorylation of Pacer under nutrient-deprived conditions promotes TIP60-mediated Pacer acetylation, which facilitates HOPS complex recruitment and is required for autophagosome maturation and lipid droplet clearance. This work not only identifies Pacer as a regulator in hepatic autophagy and liver homeostasis in vivo but also reveals a signal integration mechanism involved in late stages of autophagy and lipid metabolism."	1
"32048998"	"Mammalian RNA Decay Pathways Are Highly Specialized and Widely Linked to Translation.RNA decay is crucial for mRNA turnover and surveillance and misregulated in many diseases. This complex system is challenging to study, particularly in mammals, where it remains unclear whether decay pathways perform specialized versus redundant roles. Cytoplasmic pathways and links to translation are particularly enigmatic. By directly profiling decay factor targets and normal versus aberrant translation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we uncovered extensive decay pathway specialization and crosstalk with translation. XRN1 (5'-3') mediates cytoplasmic bulk mRNA turnover whereas SKIV2L (3'-5') is universally recruited by ribosomes, tackling aberrant translation and sometimes modulating mRNA abundance. Further exploring translation surveillance revealed AVEN and FOCAD as SKIV2L interactors. AVEN prevents ribosome stalls at structured regions, which otherwise require SKIV2L for clearance. This pathway is crucial for histone translation, upstream open reading frame (uORF) regulation, and counteracting ribosome arrest on small ORFs. In summary, we uncovered key targets, components, and functions of mammalian RNA decay pathways and extensive coupling to translation."	0
"31542296"	"Rad52 Restrains Resection at DNA Double-Strand Break Ends in Yeast.Rad52 is a key factor for homologous recombination (HR) in yeast. Rad52 helps assemble Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments that catalyze DNA strand exchange, and it mediates single-strand DNA annealing. We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from ∼3-5 kb/h up to ∼10-20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA. These results identify a role for Rad52 in limiting ssDNA generated by end resection."	1
"31677974"	"Control of RNA Pol II Speed by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 Dephosphorylation Facilitates Termination by a ""Sitting Duck Torpedo"" Mechanism.Control of transcription speed, which influences many co-transcriptional processes, is poorly understood. We report that PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase is a negative regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation rate. The PNUTS W401A mutation, which disrupts PP1 binding, causes genome-wide acceleration of transcription associated with hyper-phosphorylation of the Spt5 elongation factor. Immediately downstream of poly(A) sites, Pol II decelerates from >2 kb/min to <1 kb/min, which correlates with Spt5 dephosphorylation. Pol II deceleration and Spt5 dephosphorylation require poly(A) site recognition and the PNUTS-PP1 complex, which is in turn necessary for transcription termination. These results lead to a model for termination, the ""sitting duck torpedo"" mechanism, where poly(A) site-dependent deceleration caused by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 dephosphorylation is required to convert Pol II into a viable target for the Xrn2 terminator exonuclease. Spt5 and its bacterial homolog NusG therefore have related functions controlling kinetic competition between RNA polymerases and the termination factors that pursue them."	1
"32579942"	"Phenotypic Screen with TSC-Deficient Neurons Reveals Heat-Shock Machinery as a Druggable Pathway for mTORC1 and Reduced Cilia.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder that leads to elevated mechanistic targeting of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. Cilia can be affected by mTORC1 signaling, and ciliary deficits are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine whether neuronal cilia are affected in TSC. We show that cortical tubers from TSC patients and mutant mouse brains have fewer cilia. Using high-content image-based assays, we demonstrate that mTORC1 activity inversely correlates with ciliation in TSC1/2-deficient neurons. To investigate the mechanistic relationship between mTORC1 and cilia, we perform a phenotypic screen for mTORC1 inhibitors with TSC1/2-deficient neurons. We identify inhibitors of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) that suppress mTORC1 through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 rescues ciliation through downregulation of Hsp27. Our study uncovers the heat-shock machinery as a druggable signaling node to restore mTORC1 activity and cilia due to loss of TSC1/2, and it provides broadly applicable platforms for studying TSC-related neuronal dysfunction."	0

Kountz <i>et al</i> have discovered an alternative pathway for carnitine metabolism in the gut bacterium <i>Eubacterium limosum</i> Instead of forming TMA, carnitine is demethylated by the newly discovered methyltransferase MtcB, sending one-carbon units into production of short-chain fatty acids.

"31940493"	"FOXD3 Regulates VISTA Expression in Melanoma.Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved patient survival in melanoma, but the innate resistance of many patients necessitates the investigation of alternative immune targets. Many immune checkpoint proteins lack proper characterization, including V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA). VISTA expression on immune cells can suppress T cell activity; however, few studies have investigated its expression and regulation in cancer cells. In this study, we observe that VISTA is expressed in melanoma patient samples and cell lines. Tumor cell-specific expression of VISTA promotes tumor onset in vivo, associated with increased intratumoral T regulatory cells, and enhanced PDL-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating macrophages. VISTA transcript levels are regulated by the stemness factor Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3). BRAF inhibition upregulates FOXD3 and reduces VISTA expression. Overall, this study demonstrates melanoma cell expression of VISTA and its regulation by FOXD3, contributing to the rationale for therapeutic strategies that combine targeted inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade."	1
"32027840"	"Replicational Dilution of H3K27me3 in Mammalian Cells and the Role of Poised Promoters.Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) places H3K27me3 at developmental genes and is causally implicated in keeping bivalent genes silent. It is unclear if that silence requires minimum H3K27me3 levels and how the mark transmits faithfully across mammalian somatic cell generations. Mouse intestinal cells lacking EZH2 methyltransferase reduce H3K27me3 proportionately at all PRC2 target sites, but ∼40% uniform residual levels keep target genes inactive. These genes, derepressed in PRC2-null villus cells, remain silent in intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and computational modeling indicate that because unmodified histones dilute H3K27me3 by 50% each time DNA replicates, PRC2-deficient ISCs initially retain sufficient H3K27me3 to avoid gene derepression. EZH2 mutant human lymphoma cells also require multiple divisions before H3K27me3 dilution relieves gene silencing. In both cell types, promoters with high basal H3K4me2/3 activate in spite of some residual H3K27me3, compared to less-poised promoters. These findings have implications for PRC2 inhibition in cancer therapy."	0
"32780990"	"An In Vitro Assembly System Identifies Roles for RNA Nucleation and ATP in Yeast Stress Granule Formation.Stress granules (SGs) are condensates of mRNPs that form in response to stress. SGs arise by multivalent protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions. However, the role of RNA-RNA interactions in SG assembly remains understudied. Here, we describe a yeast SG reconstitution system that faithfully recapitulates SG assembly in response to trigger RNAs. SGs assembled by stem-loop RNA triggers are ATP-sensitive, regulated by helicase/chaperone activity, and exhibit the hallmarks of maturation observed for SG proteins that phase-separate in vitro. Additionally, the fraction of total RNA that phase-separates in vitro is sufficient to trigger SG formation. However, condensation of NFT1 mRNA, an enriched transcript in this population, can only assemble an incomplete SG. These results suggest that networks of distinct transcripts are required to form a canonical SG and provide a platform for dissecting the interplay between the transcriptome and ATP-dependent remodeling in SG formation."	0
"32620552"	"Phosphorylation on Ser-359 of the α2 subunit in GABA type A receptors down-regulates their density at inhibitory synapses.GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) mediate fast synaptic inhibition and are trafficked to functionally diverse synapses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition. The MS data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange, with the data set identifier PXD019597."	1

DBP is highly localized to the liver and pancreatic α cells. Although DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms, and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates α cell morphology, α cell function, and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP leads to smaller and hyperplastic α cells, altered Na<sup>+</sup> channel conductance, impaired α cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, this involves reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution. Defects are also seen in β cell and δ cell function. Immunostaining of human pancreata reveals generalized loss of DBP expression as a feature of late-onset and long-standing, but not early-onset, type 1 diabetes. Thus, DBP regulates α cell phenotype, with implications for diabetes pathogenesis."	0
"30898438"	"MDC1 Interacts with TOPBP1 to Maintain Chromosomal Stability during Mitosis.In mitosis, cells inactivate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to preserve genome stability. However, some early signaling events still occur, such as recruitment of the scaffold protein MDC1 to phosphorylated histone H2AX at DSBs. Yet, it remains unclear whether these events are important for maintaining genome stability during mitosis. Here, we identify a highly conserved protein-interaction surface in MDC1 that is phosphorylated by CK2 and recognized by the DNA-damage response mediator protein TOPBP1. Disruption of MDC1-TOPBP1 binding causes a specific loss of TOPBP1 recruitment to DSBs in mitotic but not interphase cells, accompanied by mitotic radiosensitivity, increased micronuclei, and chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, we find that TOPBP1 forms filamentous structures capable of bridging MDC1 foci in mitosis, indicating that MDC1-TOPBP1 complexes tether DSBs until repair is reactivated in the following G1 phase. Thus, we reveal an important, hitherto-unnoticed cooperation between MDC1 and TOPBP1 in maintaining genome stability during cell division."	1

However, its detection within low-abundance mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) has been hampered by a lack of sensitive detection strategies. Here, we adapt a chemical reactivity assay to detect internal m7G in miRNAs. Using this technique (Borohydride Reduction sequencing [BoRed-seq]) alongside RNA immunoprecipitation, we identify m7G within a subset of miRNAs that inhibit cell migration. We show that the METTL1 methyltransferase mediates m7G methylation within miRNAs and that this enzyme regulates cell migration via its catalytic activity. Using refined mass spectrometry methods, we map m7G to a single guanosine within the let-7e-5p miRNA. We show that METTL1-mediated methylation augments let-7 miRNA processing by disrupting an inhibitory secondary structure within the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA). These results identify METTL1-dependent N7-methylation of guanosine as a new RNA modification pathway that regulates miRNA structure, biogenesis, and cell migration."	0

We show that G3BP1-family-USP10 complexes are required for deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3, and RPS10 to rescue modified 40S subunits from programmed degradation. Knockout of USP10 or G3BP1 family proteins increased lysosomal ribosomal degradation and perturbed ribosomal subunit stoichiometry, both of which were rescued by a single K214R substitution of RPS3. While the majority of RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination resulted from ZNF598-dependent sensing of ribosome collisions initiating RQC, another minor pathway contributed to their monoubiquitination. G3BP1 family proteins have long been considered RNA-binding proteins, however, our results identified 40S subunits and associated mRNAs as their predominant targets, a feature shared by stress granules to which G3BP1 family proteins localize under stress."	1
"31101498"	"Analysis of the Human Kinome and Phosphatome by Mass Cytometry Reveals Overexpression-Induced Effects on Cancer-Related Signaling.Kinase and phosphatase overexpression drives tumorigenesis and drug resistance. We previously developed a mass-cytometry-based single-cell proteomics approach that enables quantitative assessment of overexpression effects on cell signaling. Here, we applied this approach in a human kinome- and phosphatome-wide study to assess how 649 individually overexpressed proteins modulated cancer-related signaling in HEK293T cells in an abundance-dependent manner. Based on these data, we expanded the functional classification of human kinases and phosphatases and showed that the overexpression effects include non-catalytic roles. We detected 208 previously unreported signaling relationships. The signaling dynamics analysis indicated that the overexpression of ERK-specific phosphatases sustains proliferative signaling. This suggests a phosphatase-driven mechanism of cancer progression. Moreover, our analysis revealed a drug-resistant mechanism through which overexpression of tyrosine kinases, including SRC, FES, YES1, and BLK, induced MEK-independent ERK activation in melanoma A375 cells. These proteins could predict drug sensitivity to BRAF-MEK concurrent inhibition in cells carrying BRAF mutations."	0

Passage of Crohn's disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) through a murine model, in which intestinal PA levels are increased to mimic the human intestine, leads to the recovery of AIEC with significantly increased virulence. Similar phenotypic changes are observed outside the murine model when AIEC is grown in culture with PA as the sole carbon source; such PA exposure also results in AIEC that persists at 20-fold higher levels in vivo. RNA sequencing identifies an upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress response, metabolism, membrane integrity, and alternative carbon source utilization. PA exposure also increases virulence in a number of E. coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients. Removal of PA is sufficient to reverse these phenotypic changes. Our data indicate that exposure to PA results in AIEC resistance and increased virulence in its presence."	0

We apply CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to introduce three RBM20 mutations in iPSCs and differentiate them into iPSC-CMs to establish an in vitro model of RBM20 mutant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In iPSC-CMs harboring a known causal RBM20 variant, the splicing of RBM20 target genes, calcium handling, and contractility are impaired consistent with the disease manifestation in patients. A variant (Pro633Leu) identified by exome sequencing of patient genomes displays the same disease phenotypes, thus establishing this variant as disease causing. We find that all-trans retinoic acid upregulates RBM20 expression and reverts the splicing, calcium handling, and contractility defects in iPSC-CMs with different causal RBM20 mutations. These results suggest that pharmacological upregulation of RBM20 expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for DCM patients with a heterozygous mutation in RBM20."	0
"32521269"	"The Protein Arginine Methyltransferase PRMT8 and Substrate G3BP1 Control Rac1-PAK1 Signaling and Actin Cytoskeleton for Dendritic Spine Maturation.Excitatory synapses of neurons are located on dendritic spines. Spine maturation is essential for the stability of synapses and memory consolidation, and overproduction of the immature filopodia is associated with brain disorders. The structure and function of synapses can be modulated by protein post-translational modification (PTM). Arginine methylation is a major PTM that regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and splicing within the nucleus. Here we find that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 is present at neuronal synapses and its expression is upregulated in the hippocampus when dendritic spine maturation occurs. Depletion of PRMT8 leads to overabundance of filopodia and mis-localization of excitatory synapses. Mechanistically, PRMT8 promotes dendritic spine morphology through methylation of the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1 and suppression of the Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway to control synaptic actin dynamics. Our findings unravel arginine methylation as a crucial regulatory mechanism for actin cytoskeleton during synapse development."	1

Using CRISPR-Cas9, we deplete SORL1 in hiPSCs to ask if loss of SORL1 contributes to AD pathogenesis by endosome dysfunction. SORL1-deficient hiPSC neurons show early endosome enlargement, a hallmark cytopathology of AD. There is no effect of SORL1 depletion on endosome size in hiPSC microglia, suggesting a selective effect on neuronal endosomal trafficking. We validate defects in neuronal endosomal traffic by showing altered localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in early endosomes, a site of APP cleavage by the β-secretase (BACE). Inhibition of BACE does not rescue endosome enlargement in SORL1-deficient neurons, suggesting that this phenotype is independent of amyloidogenic APP processing. Our data, together with recent findings, underscore how sporadic AD pathways regulating endosomal trafficking and autosomal-dominant AD pathways regulating APP cleavage independently converge on the defining cytopathology of AD."	0

We demonstrate that canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which mediates higher-order chromatin structures, contributes little to gene repression. Instead, we uncover an unexpectedly high degree of synergy between variant PRC1 complexes, which is fundamental to gene repression. We further demonstrate that variant PRC1 complexes are responsible for distinct pools of H2A monoubiquitylation that are associated with repression of Polycomb target genes and silencing during X chromosome inactivation.

Blocking apoptosis in Drosophila wings leads to the necrosis-driven systemic immune response by unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that immune activation in response to necrotic cells is mediated by commensal gut microbiota. Removing the microbiome attenuates hyperactivation of the innate immune signaling IMD pathway in necrosis-induced flies. Necrotic cells in wings trigger Gluconobacter expansion in the gut. An isolated Gluconobacter sp. strain is sufficient for pathological IMD activation in necrosis-induced flies, while it is not inflammatory for control animals. In addition, bacterial colonization shifts the host metabolome and shortens the lifespan of necrosis-induced flies. This study shows that local necrosis triggers a pathological systemic inflammatory response through interaction between the host and the dysbiotic gut microbiome."	0

However, UCP1 expression but not DNL activation requires rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1. Furthermore, β3-adrenergic agonist CL316243 readily upregulates thermogenic but not lipogenic genes in cultured adipocytes, indicating that additional regulators must operate on DNL in sWAT in vivo. We identify one such factor as thyroid hormone T3, which is elevated locally by adrenergic signaling. T3 administration to wild-type mice enhances both thermogenesis and DNL in sWAT. Mechanistically, T3 action on UCP1 expression in sWAT depends upon cAMP and is blocked in Adipo-GsαKO mice even as elevated DNL persists. Thus, T3 enhances sWAT thermogenesis by amplifying cAMP signaling, while its control of adipocyte DNL can be mediated independently of both cAMP and rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1."	0

Previous biochemical studies have revealed that PLB interacts with a specific inhibitory site on SERCA, and low-resolution structural evidence suggests that PLB interacts with distinct alternative sites on SERCA. High-resolution details of the structural determinants of SERCA regulation have been elusive because of the dynamic nature of the regulatory complex. In this study, we used computational approaches to develop a structural model of SERCA-PLB interactions to gain a mechanistic understanding of PLB-mediated SERCA transport regulation. We combined steered molecular dynamics and membrane protein-protein docking experiments to achieve both a global search and all-atom force calculations to determine the relative affinities of PLB for candidate sites on SERCA. We modeled the binding of PLB to several SERCA conformations, representing different enzymatic states sampled during the calcium transport catalytic cycle. The results of the steered molecular dynamics and docking experiments indicated that the canonical PLB-binding site (comprising transmembrane helices M2, M4, and M9) is the preferred site. This preference was even more stringent for a superinhibitory PLB variant. Interestingly, PLB-binding specificity became more ambivalent for other SERCA conformers. These results provide evidence for polymorphic PLB interactions with novel sites on M3 and with the outside of the SERCA helix M9. Our findings are compatible with previous physical measurements that suggest that PLB interacts with multiple binding sites, conferring dynamic responsiveness to changing physiological conditions."	0
"31968249"	"The Mitochondrial Protein MAVS Stabilizes p53 to Suppress Tumorigenesis.Recent reports have shown the critical role of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein in virus-induced apoptosis, but the involvement of MAVS in tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Herein, we report that MAVS is a key regulator of p53 activation and is critical for protecting against tumorigenesis. We find that MAVS promotes p53-dependent cell death in response to DNA damage. MAVS interacts with p53 and mediates p53 mitochondrial recruitment under genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, MAVS inhibits p53 ubiquitination by blocking the formation of the p53-murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) complex, leading to the stabilization of p53. Notably, compared with their wild-type littermates, MAVS knockout mice display decreased resistance to azoxymethane (AOM) or AOM/dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced colon cancer. MAVS expression is significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues. These results unveil roles for MAVS in DNA damage response and tumor suppression."	1
"32783948"	"Comparison of Human Antral Follicles of Xenograft versus Ovarian Origin Reveals Disparate Molecular Signatures.The activation, growth, and maturation of oocytes to an ovulatory phase, termed folliculogenesis, is governed by the orchestrated activity of multiple specialized cell types within the ovary; yet, the mechanisms governing diversification and behavior of discrete cellular sub-populations within follicles are poorly understood. We use bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to distinguish the transcriptional signature of prospectively isolated granulosa and theca/stroma cell subsets within human antral follicles derived from xenografts or ovaries. The analysis deconstructs phenotypic diversification within small (<4 mm) antral follicles, identifying secreted factors that are differentially enriched between mural and oophorus granulosa cells, and segregating stromal/support and steroidal activity between theca externa and interna, respectively. Multiple factors are differentially expressed in follicles of xenograft versus ovarian origin. These data capture a high-resolution transcriptional signature of granulosa and theca subpopulations and provide a systems-level portrait of cellular diversification in early antral human follicles."	0
"32367047"	"Myeloid PTEN promotes chemotherapy-induced NLRP3-inflammasome activation and antitumour immunity.PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase that is frequently mutated in human cancer, and its deficiency in cancer has been associated with therapy resistance and poor survival. Although the intrinsic tumour-suppressor function of PTEN has been well established, evidence of its role in the tumour immune microenvironment is lacking. Here, we show that chemotherapy-induced antitumour immune responses and tumour suppression rely on myeloid-cell PTEN, which is essential for chemotherapy-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and antitumour immunity. PTEN directly interacts with and dephosphorylates NLRP3 to enable NLRP3-ASC interaction, inflammasome assembly and activation. Importantly, supplementation of IL-1β restores chemotherapy sensitivity in mouse myeloid cells with a PTEN deficiency. Clinically, chemotherapy-induced IL-1β production and antitumour immunity in patients with cancer is correlated with PTEN expression in myeloid cells, but not tumour cells. Our results demonstrate that myeloid PTEN can determine chemotherapy responsiveness by promoting NLRP3-dependent antitumour immunity and suggest that myeloid PTEN might be a potential biomarker to predict chemotherapy responses."	1

Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry indicated that, in fibroblasts, CARMIL1 associates with interleukin (IL)-1 signaling molecules. Immunoprecipitation of cells transfected with CARMIL1 mutants showed that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of CARMIL1 associates with IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Knockout of CARMIL1 by CRISPR-Cas9 reduced IL-1-induced ERK activation by 72% and MMP3 expression by 40%. Compared with CARMIL1 wild-type (WT), cells expressing mutant CARMIL1 lacking its LRR domain exhibited 45% lower ERK activation and 40% lower MMP3 expression. In fibroblasts transduced with a cell-permeable, TAT CARMIL1 peptide that competed with IL-1R1 and IRAK binding to the LRR of CARMIL1, collagen degradation was reduced by 43%. As the LRR of CARMIL1 evidently regulates IL-1 signaling, CARMIL1 could become a target for anti-inflammatory drug development."	1
"30472191"	"ATP-Dependent Dynamic Protein Aggregation Regulates Bacterial Dormancy Depth Critical for Antibiotic Tolerance.Cell dormancy is a widespread mechanism used by bacteria to evade environmental threats, including antibiotics. Here we monitored bacterial antibiotic tolerance and regrowth at the single-cell level and found that each individual survival cell shows different ""dormancy depth,"" which in return regulates the lag time for cell resuscitation after removal of antibiotic. We further established that protein aggresome-a collection of endogenous protein aggregates-is an important indicator of bacterial dormancy depth, whose formation is promoted by decreased cellular ATP level. For cells to leave the dormant state and resuscitate, clearance of protein aggresome and recovery of proteostasis are required. We revealed that the ability to recruit functional DnaK-ClpB machineries, which facilitate protein disaggregation in an ATP-dependent manner, determines the lag time for bacterial regrowth. Better understanding of the key factors regulating bacterial regrowth after surviving antibiotic attack could lead to new therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial antibiotic tolerance."	0
"32460025"	"The Drosophila Ortholog of Mammalian Transcription Factor Sox9 Regulates Intestinal Homeostasis and Regeneration at an Appropriate Level.Balanced stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcription factor SRY-related HMG-box (Sox) 100B, which is orthologous to mammalian Sox8/9/10, as a common target and central mediator of the EGFR/Ras and JAK/STAT signaling pathways that coordinates intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and differentiation during both normal epithelial homeostasis and stress-induced intestinal repair in Drosophila. The two stress-responsive pathways directly regulate Sox100B transcription via two separate enhancers. Interestingly, an appropriate level of Sox100B is critical for its function, as its depletion inhibits ISC proliferation via cell cycle arrest, while its overexpression also inhibits ISC proliferation by directly suppressing EGFR expression and additionally promotes ISC differentiation by activating a differentiation-promoting regulatory circuitry composed of Sox100B, Sox21a, and Pdm1. Thus, our study reveals a Sox family transcription factor that functions as a stress-responsive signaling nexus that ultimately controls tissue homeostasis and regeneration."	1
"32130912"	"Hierarchy in Hfq Chaperon Occupancy of Small RNA Targets Plays a Major Role in Their Regulation.Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression that base pair with complementary sequences on target mRNAs, often in association with the chaperone Hfq. Here, using experimentally identified sRNA-target pairs, along with gene expression measurements, we assess basic principles of regulation by sRNAs. We show that the sRNA sequence dictates the target repertoire, as point mutations in the sRNA shift the target set correspondingly. We distinguish two subsets of targets: targets showing changes in expression levels under overexpression of their sRNA regulator and unaffected targets that interact more sporadically with the sRNA. These differences among targets are associated with their Hfq occupancy, rather than with the sRNA-target base-pairing potential. Our results suggest that competition among targets over Hfq binding plays a major role in the regulatory outcome, possibly awarding targets with higher Hfq binding efficiency an advantage in the competition over binding to the sRNA."	0

To further understand the mechanisms that underlie neocortical growth, we focused our studies on the microcephaly gene Mcph1, and we report here that Mcph1 (1) exerts its functions in rapidly dividing apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) during mouse neocortical development stages that precede indirect neurogenesis; (2) is expressed at mitochondria; and (3) controls the proper proliferation and survival of RGCs, potentially through crosstalk with cellular metabolic pathways involving the stimulation of mitochondrial activity via VDAC1/GRP75 and AKT/HK2/VDAC1 and glutaminolysis via ATF4/PCK2. We currently report the description of a MCPH-gene implication in the interplay between bioenergetic pathways and neocortical growth, thus pointing to alterations of cellular metabolic pathways, in particular glutaminolysis, as a possible cause of microcephalic pathogenesis."	1
"32268090"	"TBK1 and IKKε Act Redundantly to Mediate STING-Induced NF-κB Responses in Myeloid Cells.Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a critical component of host innate immune defense but can contribute to chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease. Once activated, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway induces both type I interferon (IFN) expression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated cytokine production. Currently, these two signaling arms are thought to be mediated by a single upstream kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that TBK1 alone is dispensable for STING-induced NF-κB responses in human and mouse immune cells, as well as in vivo. We further demonstrate that TBK1 acts redundantly with IκB kinase ε (IKKε) to drive NF-κB upon STING activation. Interestingly, we show that activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is highly dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, whereas NF-κB is significantly less sensitive to TBK1/IKKε kinase inhibition. Our work redefines signaling events downstream of cGAS-STING. Our findings further suggest that cGAS-STING will need to be targeted directly to effectively ameliorate the inflammation underpinning disorders associated with STING hyperactivity."	1
"32460022"	"Macrophages Use Distinct Actin Regulators to Switch Engulfment Strategies and Ensure Phagocytic Plasticity In Vivo.Macrophages must not only be responsive to an array of different stimuli, such as infection and cellular damage, but also perform phagocytosis within the diverse and complex tissue environments found in vivo. This requires a high degree of morphological and therefore cytoskeletal plasticity. Here, we use the exceptional genetics and in vivo imaging of Drosophila embryos to study macrophage phagocytic versatility during apoptotic corpse clearance. We find that macrophage phagocytosis is highly robust, arising from their possession of two distinct modes of engulfment that utilize exclusive suites of actin-regulatory proteins. ""Lamellipodial phagocytosis"" is Arp2/3-complex-dependent and allows cells to migrate toward and envelop apoptotic corpses. Alternatively, Diaphanous and Ena drive filopodial phagocytosis to reach out and draw in debris. Macrophages switch to ""filopodial phagocytosis"" to overcome spatial constraint, providing the robust plasticity necessary to ensure that whatever obstacle they encounter in vivo, they fulfil their critical clearance function."	0
"31919192"	"Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 degradation regulates kinetochore composition in meiosis.The kinetochore complex is a conserved machinery that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules. During meiosis, the kinetochore is restructured to accommodate a specialized chromosome segregation pattern. In budding yeast, meiotic kinetochore remodeling is mediated by the temporal changes in the abundance of a single subunit called Ndc80. We previously described the regulatory events that control the timely synthesis of Ndc80. Here, we report that Ndc80 turnover is also tightly regulated in meiosis: Ndc80 degradation is active in meiotic prophase, but not in metaphase I. Ndc80 degradation depends on the ubiquitin ligase APC<sup>Ama1</sup> and is mediated by the proteasome. Importantly, Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation, a mark that has been previously implicated in correcting erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, is essential for Ndc80 degradation in a microtubule-independent manner. The N terminus of Ndc80, including a 27-residue sequence and Aurora B phosphorylation sites, is both necessary and sufficient for kinetochore protein degradation. Finally, defects in Ndc80 turnover predispose meiotic cells to chromosome mis-segregation. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which meiotic cells modulate their kinetochore composition through regulated Ndc80 degradation, and demonstrates that Aurora B-dependent regulation of kinetochores extends beyond altering microtubule attachments."	1
"32755570"	"The MARCH6-SQLE Axis Controls Endothelial Cholesterol Homeostasis and Angiogenic Sprouting.The endothelial monolayer forms a barrier between the lumen of blood vessels and the underlying tissues. Stable VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions are essential for maintaining this barrier, whereas their remodeling is required for angiogenesis in health and disease. Here, we position the ERAD-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a determinant of angiogenic sprouting and barrier integrity through its ability to promote the degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Accordingly, MARCHF6 ablation in endothelial cells increases SQLE protein and cholesterol load. This leads to altered membrane order, disorganized adherens junctions, decreased endothelial barrier function, and impaired SQLE-dependent sprouting angiogenesis. Akin to MARCHF6 silencing, the overexpression of SQLE impairs angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is also attenuated when SQLE is silenced, indicating that fine-tuning cholesterol biosynthesis is a determinant of healthy endothelial function. In summary, we propose a mechanistic link between regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by the MARCH6-SQLE axis and endothelial integrity and angiogenesis."	1
"32101753"	"Auto-ubiquitination of NEDD4-1 Recruits USP13 to Facilitate Autophagy through Deubiquitinating VPS34.The class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) is a core protein of autophagy initiation, yet the regulatory mechanisms responsible for its stringent control remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1 promotes the autophagy flux by targeting VPS34. NEDD4-1 undergoes lysine 29 (K29)-linked auto-ubiquitination at K1279 and serves as a scaffold for recruiting the ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) to form an NEDD4-1-USP13 deubiquitination complex, which subsequently stabilizes VPS34 to promote autophagy through removing the K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from VPS34 at K419. Knockout of either NEDD4-1 or USP13 increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of VPS34, thus attenuating the formation of the autophagosome. Our results identify an essential role for NEDD4-1 in regulating autophagy, which provides molecular insights into the mechanisms by which ubiquitination regulates autophagy flux."	1
"32905775"	"Local Production of Osteoprotegerin by Osteoblasts Suppresses Bone Resorption.Osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits the ability of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) to stimulate the differentiation, activity, and survival of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Genetic studies in mice show that osteocytes are an important source of RANKL, but the cellular sources of OPG are unclear. We use conditional deletion of Tnfrsf11b, which encodes OPG, from different cell populations to identify functionally relevant sources of OPG in mice. Deletion from B lymphocytes and osteocytes, two cell types commonly thought to supply OPG, has little or no impact on bone mass. By contrast, deletion of Tnfrsf11b from osteoblasts increases bone resorption and reduces bone mass to an extent similar to germline deletion, demonstrating that osteoblasts are an essential source of OPG. These results suggest that, in addition to producing new bone matrix, osteoblasts also play an active role in terminating the resorption phase of the bone remodeling cycle by suppressing RANKL activity."	0
"32160543"	"MYC Dysregulates Mitosis, Revealing Cancer Vulnerabilities.Tumors that overexpress the MYC oncogene are frequently aneuploid, a state associated with highly aggressive cancers and tumor evolution. However, how MYC causes aneuploidy is not well understood. Here, we show that MYC overexpression induces mitotic spindle assembly defects and chromosomal instability (CIN) through effects on microtubule nucleation and organization. Attenuating MYC expression reverses mitotic defects, even in established tumor cell lines, indicating an ongoing role for MYC in CIN. MYC reprograms mitotic gene expression, and we identify TPX2 to be permissive for spindle assembly in MYC-high cells. TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death, and prevents tumor growth. Further elevating TPX2 expression reduces mitotic defects in MYC-high cells. MYC and TPX2 expression may be useful biomarkers to stratify patients for anti-mitotic therapies. Our studies implicate MYC as a regulator of mitosis and suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution."	0

Abnormal regulation of the dynamic assembly and disassembly cycle of primary cilia is closely related to ciliopathy and cancer. The Wnt signaling pathway plays a major role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, and defects in Wnt signaling are associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer. In this study, we provide direct evidence of Wnt3a-induced primary ciliogenesis, which includes a continuous pathway showing that the stimulation of Wnt3a, a canonical Wnt ligand, promotes the generation of β-catenin p-S47 epitope by CK1δ, and these events lead to the reorganization of centriolar satellites resulting in primary ciliogenesis. We have also confirmed the application of our findings in MCF-7/ADR cells, a multidrug-resistant tumor cell model. Thus, our data provide a Wnt3a-induced primary ciliogenesis pathway and may provide a clue on how to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer treatment."	1
"32101755"	"Entropic Bristles Tune the Seeding Efficiency of Prion-Nucleating Fragments.Prions of lower eukaryotes are self-templating protein aggregates with cores formed by parallel in-register beta strands. Short aggregation-prone glutamine (Q)- and asparagine (N)-rich regions embedded in longer disordered domains have been proposed to act as nucleation sites that initiate refolding of soluble prion proteins into highly ordered fibrils, termed amyloid. We demonstrate that a short Q/N-rich peptide corresponding to a proposed nucleation site in the prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion protein Sup35 is sufficient to induce infectious cytosolic prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells ectopically expressing the soluble Sup35 NM prion domain. Embedding this nucleating core in a non-native N-rich sequence that does not form amyloid but acts as an entropic bristle quadruples seeding efficiency. Our data suggest that large disordered sequences flanking an aggregation core in prion proteins act as not only solubilizers of the monomeric protein but also breakers of the formed amyloid fibrils, enhancing infectivity of the prion seeds."	0
"32721385"	"Rationally Designed APOBEC3B Cytosine Base Editors with Improved Specificity.Cytosine base editors (CBEs) generate C-to-T nucleotide substitutions in genomic target sites without inducing double-strand breaks. However, CBEs such as BE3 can cause genome-wide off-target changes via sgRNA-independent DNA deamination. By leveraging the orthogonal R-loops generated by SaCas9 nickase to mimic actively transcribed genomic loci that are more susceptible to cytidine deaminase, we set up a high-throughput assay for assessing sgRNA-independent off-target effects of CBEs in rice protoplasts. The reliability of this assay was confirmed by the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 10 base editors in regenerated rice plants. The R-loop assay was used to screen a series of rationally designed A3Bctd-BE3 variants for improved specificity. We obtained 2 efficient CBE variants, A3Bctd-VHM-BE3 and A3Bctd-KKR-BE3, and the WGS analysis revealed that these new CBEs eliminated sgRNA-independent DNA off-target edits in rice plants. Moreover, these 2 base editor variants were more precise at their target sites by producing fewer multiple C edits."	0
"32579914"	"NeuroD1 Dictates Tumor Cell Differentiation in Medulloblastoma.Tumor cells are characterized by unlimited proliferation and perturbed differentiation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that tumor cells in medulloblastoma (MB) retain their capacity to differentiate in a similar way as their normal originating cells, cerebellar granule neuron precursors. Once they differentiate, MB cells permanently lose their proliferative capacity and tumorigenic potential. Differentiated MB cells highly express NeuroD1, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and forced expression of NeuroD1 promotes the differentiation of MB cells. The expression of NeuroD1 in bulk MB cells is repressed by trimethylation of histone 3 lysine-27 (H3K27me3). Inhibition of the histone lysine methyltransferase EZH2 prevents H3K27 trimethylation, resulting in increased NeuroD1 expression and enhanced differentiation in MB cells, which consequently reduces tumor growth. These studies reveal the mechanisms underlying MB cell differentiation and provide rationales to treat MB (potentially other malignancies) by stimulating tumor cell differentiation."	1

We find that male mice with brain-specific isoform A knockout (Oxr1A<sup>-/-</sup>) develop fatty liver. RNA sequencing of male Oxr1A<sup>-/-</sup> liver indicates decreased growth hormone (GH) signaling, which is known to affect liver metabolism. Indeed, Gh expression is reduced in male mice Oxr1A<sup>-/-</sup> pituitary gland and in rat Oxr1A<sup>-/-</sup> pituitary adenoma cell-line GH3. Oxr1A<sup>-/-</sup> male mice show reduced fasting-blood GH levels. Pull-down and proximity ligation assays reveal that OXR1A is associated with arginine methyl transferase PRMT5. OXR1A-depleted GH3 cells show reduced symmetrical dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2me2s), a product of PRMT5 catalyzed methylation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of H3R2me2s shows reduced Gh promoter enrichment. Finally, we demonstrate with purified proteins that OXR1A stimulates PRMT5/MEP50-catalyzed H3R2me2s. Our data suggest that OXR1A is a coactivator of PRMT5, regulating histone arginine methylation and thereby GH production within the pituitary gland."	1

We have identified TSPYL5 (testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 5) as a PML body component, co-localizing with ALT telomeres and critical for ALT<sup>+</sup> cell viability. TSPYL5 was described as an inhibitor of the USP7 deubiquitinase. We report that TSPYL5 prevents the poly-ubiquitination of POT1-a shelterin component-and protects POT1 from proteasomal degradation exclusively in ALT<sup>+</sup> cells. USP7 depletion rescued POT1 poly-ubiquitination and loss, suggesting that the deubiquitinase activates POT1 E3 ubiquitin ligase(s). Similarly, PML depletion suppressed POT1 poly-ubiquitination, suggesting an interplay between USP7 and PML to trigger POT1 degradation in TSPYL5-depleted ALT<sup>+</sup> cells.

Bacterial RNP-bodies (BR-bodies) are a biomolecular condensate containing the RNA degradosome mRNA decay machinery, but the biochemical function of such organization remains poorly defined. Here, we define the RNA substrates of BR-bodies through enrichment of the bodies followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We find that long, poorly translated mRNAs, small RNAs, and antisense RNAs are the main substrates, while rRNA, tRNA, and other conserved non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are excluded from these bodies. BR-bodies stimulate the mRNA decay rate of enriched mRNAs, helping to reshape the cellular mRNA pool. We also observe that BR-body formation promotes complete mRNA decay, avoiding the buildup of toxic endo-cleaved mRNA decay intermediates. The combined selective permeability of BR-bodies for both enzymes and substrates together with the stimulation of the sub-steps of mRNA decay provide an effective organization strategy for bacterial mRNA decay."	0
"32513871"	"CRISPR type II-A subgroups exhibit phylogenetically distinct mechanisms for prespacer insertion.CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes against foreign nucleic acids. Prokaryotes gain immunity by acquiring short pieces of the invading nucleic acid termed prespacers and inserting them into their CRISPR array. In type II-A systems, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins insert prespacers always at the leader-repeat junction of the CRISPR array. Among type II-A CRISPR systems, three distinct groups (G1, G2, and G3) exist according to the extent of DNA sequence conservation at the 3' end of the leader. However, the mechanisms by which these conserved motifs interact with their cognate Cas1 and Cas2 proteins remain unclear. Here, we performed <i>in vitro</i> integration assays, finding that for G1 and G2, the insertion site is recognized through defined mechanisms, at least in members examined to date, whereas G3 exhibits no sequence-specific insertion. G1 first recognized a 12-bp sequence at the leader-repeat junction and performed leader-side insertion before proceeding to spacer-side insertion. G2 recognized the full repeat sequence and could perform independent leader-side or spacer-side insertions, although the leader-side insertion was faster than spacer-side. The prespacer morphology requirements for Cas1-Cas2 varied, with G1 stringently requiring a 5-nucleotide 3' overhang and G2 being able to insert many forms of prespacers with variable efficiencies. These results highlight the intricacy of protein-DNA sequence interactions within the seemingly similar type II-A integration complexes and provide mechanistic insights into prespacer insertion. These interactions can be fine-tuned to expand the Cas1-Cas2 toolset for inserting small DNAs into diverse DNA targets."	0

Here, we show that Drosophila Atg8a protein, homologous to mammalian LC3, interacts with the transcription factor Sequoia in a LIR motif-dependent manner. We show that Sequoia depletion induces autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions through the enhanced expression of autophagy genes. We show that Atg8a interacts with YL-1, a component of a nuclear acetyltransferase complex, and that it is acetylated in nutrient-rich conditions. We also show that Atg8a interacts with the deacetylase Sir2, which deacetylates Atg8a during starvation to activate autophagy. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation of the expression of autophagy genes by Atg8a, which is linked to its acetylation status and its interaction with Sequoia, YL-1, and Sir2."	1
"31327636"	"HokB Monomerization and Membrane Repolarization Control Persister Awakening.Every bacterial population harbors a small subpopulation of so-called persisters that are transiently antibiotic tolerant. These persisters are associated with the recalcitrance of chronic infections because they can recolonize the host after antibiotic removal. Although several effectors have been described to induce persistence, persister cell awakening is poorly understood. We previously reported that the toxin HokB induces persistence via pore formation, resulting in membrane depolarization and ATP leakage. We now delineate mechanisms responsible for the awakening of HokB-induced persisters. We show that HokB dimerization by the oxidoreductase DsbA is essential for pore formation and peptide stability. Pores are disassembled via DsbC-mediated monomerization, which targets HokB for DegQ-mediated degradation. Finally, pore disassembly allows membrane repolarization by the electron transport chain, supporting cells to resume growth. These results provide a detailed view of both the formation and awakening of HokB-induced persister cells."	0
"32610121"	"Adipocyte-Derived Versican and Macrophage-Derived Biglycan Control Adipose Tissue Inflammation in Obesity.Obesity is characterized by adipose tissue inflammation. Because proteoglycans regulate inflammation, here we investigate their role in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. We find that adipose tissue versican and biglycan increase in obesity. Versican is produced mainly by adipocytes and biglycan by adipose tissue macrophages. Both proteoglycans are also present in adipose tissue from obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Deletion of adipocyte-specific versican or macrophage-specific biglycan in mice reduces macrophage accumulation and chemokine and cytokine expression, although only adipocyte-specific versican deletion leads to sustained improvement in glucose tolerance. Macrophage-derived biglycan activates inflammatory genes in adipocytes. Versican expression increases in cultured adipocytes exposed to excess glucose, and adipocyte-conditioned medium stimulates inflammation in resident peritoneal macrophages, in part because of a versican breakdown product, versikine. These findings provide insights into the role of adipocyte- and macrophage-derived proteoglycans in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity."	0
"32049022"	"Symmetric Arginine Dimethylation Is Selectively Required for mRNA Splicing and the Initiation of Type I and Type III Interferon Signaling.Alternative splicing is well understood to enhance proteome diversity as cells respond to stimuli. However, mechanistic understanding for how the spliceosome processes precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to achieve template diversification is incomplete. We use recently developed enzymatic inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and human naive T lymphocyte activation as a model system to uncover a precise set of mRNA transcripts that require symmetric arginine dimethylation. This methylation-dependent splicing selectivity is associated with a limited set of signaling pathways that are affected when PRMT5 is inhibited. Specifically, we identify a conserved role for symmetric arginine dimethylation in the induction of antiviral type I and type III interferon signaling following T cell receptor and pattern recognition receptor stimulation in human T lymphocytes and undifferentiated human THP-1 monocytes.

Here, we reveal an unexpected role for an essential DEAD-box helicase, DDX18, in antagonizing the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to prevent deposition of the repressive H3K27me3 mark onto rDNA in pluripotent cells. DDX18 binds and sequesters PRC2 in the outer layer of the nucleolus and counteracts PRC2 complex formation in vivo and in vitro. DDX18 knockdown leads to increased occupancy of PRC2 and H3K27me3 at rDNA loci, accompanied by drastically decreased rRNA transcription and reduced ribosomal protein expression and translation. Auxin-induced rapid degradation of DDX18 enhances PRC2 binding at rDNA. The inhibition of PRC2 partially rescues the effects of DDX18 depletion on rRNA transcription and ESC self-renewal. These results demonstrate a critical role for DDX18 in safeguarding the chromatin and transcriptional integrity of rDNA by counteracting the epigenetic silencing machinery to promote pluripotency."	1

We have examined RMDs induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) under varying conditions of repeat sequence divergence (identical versus 1% and 3% divergent) and DSB/repeat distance (16 bp-28.4 kbp). We find that the BLM helicase promotes RMDs with long DSB/repeat distances (e.g., 28.4 kbp), which is consistent with a role in extensive DSB end resection, because the resection nucleases EXO1 and DNA2 affect RMDs similarly to BLM. In contrast, BLM suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence and intermediate (e.g., 3.3 kbp) DSB/repeat distances, which supports a role in heteroduplex rejection. The role of BLM in heteroduplex rejection is not epistatic with MSH2 and is independent of the annealing factor RAD52. Accordingly, the role of BLM on RMDs is substantially affected by DSB/repeat distance and repeat sequence divergence."	0
"32610131"	"Senescence, Necrosis, and Apoptosis Govern Circulating Cell-free DNA Release Kinetics.The kinetics of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) release may provide a real-time assessment of induced cell death. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying biological rationale for cfDNA release following distinct treatments and cell death mechanisms. Here, we uncover a complex interplay between apoptosis, necrosis, and senescence in determining cfDNA release kinetics. Utilizing multiple in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we show how cfDNA release is modulated through a combination of apoptotic and senescent triggers and inhibitors. Interestingly, we identify treatment-induced senescence as a previously unrecognized determinant of cfDNA kinetics that can counteract its release. Necrosis is the predominant cell death mechanism that consistently contributes to cfDNA release in response to ionizing radiation, and, surprisingly, apoptosis plays a comparatively minor role in some tumors. Based on our results, we propose a model to explain cfDNA release from cells over time, with important implications for future studies."	0
"31901447"	"Lipid Droplet-Derived Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Traffic via PLIN5 to Allosterically Activate SIRT1.Lipid droplets (LDs) provide a reservoir for triacylglycerol storage and are a central hub for fatty acid trafficking and signaling in cells. Lipolysis promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism via a SIRT1/PGC-1α/PPARα-dependent pathway through an unknown mechanism. Herein, we identify that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) allosterically activate SIRT1 toward select peptide-substrates such as PGC-1α. MUFAs enhance PGC-1α/PPARα signaling and promote oxidative metabolism in cells and animal models in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Moreover, we characterize the LD protein perilipin 5 (PLIN5), which is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and function, to be a fatty-acid-binding protein that preferentially binds LD-derived monounsaturated fatty acids and traffics them to the nucleus following cAMP/PKA-mediated lipolytic stimulation. Thus, these studies identify the first-known endogenous allosteric modulators of SIRT1 and characterize a LD-nuclear signaling axis that underlies the known metabolic benefits of MUFAs and PLIN5."	1
"32521280"	"ELKS1 Captures Rab6-Marked Vesicular Cargo in Presynaptic Nerve Terminals.Neurons face unique transport challenges. They need to deliver cargo over long axonal distances and to many presynaptic nerve terminals. Rab GTPases are master regulators of vesicular traffic, but essential presynaptic Rabs have not been identified. Here, we find that Rab6, a Golgi-derived GTPase for constitutive secretion, associates with mobile axonal cargo and localizes to nerve terminals. ELKS1 is a stationary presynaptic protein with Golgin homology that binds to Rab6. Knockout and rescue experiments for ELKS1 and Rab6 establish that ELKS1 captures Rab6 cargo. The ELKS1-Rab6-capturing mechanism can be transferred to mitochondria by mistargeting ELKS1 or Rab6 to them. We conclude that nerve terminals have repurposed mechanisms from constitutive exocytosis for their highly regulated secretion. By employing Golgin-like mechanisms with anchored ELKS extending its coiled-coils to capture Rab6 cargo, they have spatially separated cargo capture from fusion. ELKS complexes connect to active zones and may mediate vesicle progression toward release sites."	1
"31300274"	"Nuclear TARBP2 Drives Oncogenic Dysregulation of RNA Splicing and Decay.Post-transcriptional regulation of RNA stability is a key step in gene expression control. We describe a regulatory program, mediated by the RNA binding protein TARBP2, that controls RNA stability in the nucleus. TARBP2 binding to pre-mRNAs results in increased intron retention, subsequently leading to targeted degradation of TARBP2-bound transcripts. This is mediated by TARBP2 recruitment of the m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation machinery to its target transcripts, where deposition of m<sup>6</sup>A marks influences the recruitment of splicing regulators, inhibiting efficient splicing. Interactions between TARBP2 and the nucleoprotein TPR then promote degradation of these TARBP2-bound transcripts by the nuclear exosome. Additionally, analysis of clinical gene expression datasets revealed a functional role for TARBP2 in lung cancer. Using xenograft mouse models, we find that TARBP2 affects tumor growth in the lung and that this is dependent on TARBP2-mediated destabilization of ABCA3 and FOXN3. Finally, we establish ZNF143 as an upstream regulator of TARBP2 expression."	0

Harvesting tissue from failing kidneys and autotransplantation of tissue progenitors could theoretically delay the need for dialysis. Here we use healthy and end-stage human adult kidneys to robustly expand proliferative kidney epithelial cells and establish 3D kidney epithelial cultures termed ""nephrospheres."" Formation of nephrospheres reestablishes renal identity and function in primary cultures. Transplantation into NOD/SCID mice shows that nephrospheres restore self-organogenetic properties lost in monolayer cultures, allowing long-term engraftment as tubular structures, potentially adding nephron segments and demonstrating self-organization as critical to survival. Furthermore, long-term tubular engraftment of nephrospheres is functionally beneficial in murine models of chronic kidney disease. Remarkably, nephrospheres inhibit pro-fibrotic collagen production in cultured fibroblasts via paracrine modulation, while transplanted nephrospheres induce transcriptional signatures of proliferation and release from quiescence, suggesting re-activation of endogenous repair. These data support the use of human nephrospheres for renal cell therapy."	0
"32937124"	"The Natural Compound Notopterol Binds and Targets JAK2/3 to Ameliorate Inflammation and Arthritis.The traditional Chinese medicinal herb Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H.T. Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients' serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway."	1
"32320653"	"The Autophagy-Initiating Kinase ULK1 Controls RIPK1-Mediated Cell Death.Autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis are stress responses governing the ultimate fate of a cell. However, the crosstalk between these cellular stress responses is not entirely understood. Especially, it is not clear whether the autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 and the cell-death-regulating kinase RIPK1 are involved in this potential crosstalk. Here, we identify RIPK1 as a substrate of ULK1. ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of RIPK1 reduces complex IIb/necrosome assembly and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death, whereas deprivation of ULK1 enhances TNF-induced cell death. We observe that ULK1 phosphorylates multiple sites of RIPK1, but it appears that especially phosphorylation of S357 within the intermediate domain of RIPK1 mediates this cell-death-inhibiting effect. We propose that ULK1 is a regulator of RIPK1-mediated cell death."	1
"32661198"	"The first DEP domain of the RhoGEF P-Rex1 autoinhibits activity and contributes to membrane binding.Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>)-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac GTPases, thereby triggering changes in the actin cytoskeleton and in transcription. Its overexpression is highly correlated with the metastasis of certain cancers. P-Rex1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and its activity are regulated via interactions with heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, PIP<sub>3</sub>, and protein kinase A (PKA). Deletion analysis has further shown that domains C-terminal to its catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain confer autoinhibition. Among these, the first dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin domain (DEP1) remains to be structurally characterized. DEP1 also harbors the primary PKA phosphorylation site, suggesting that an improved understanding of this region could substantially increase our knowledge of P-Rex1 signaling and open the door to new selective chemotherapeutics. Here we show that the DEP1 domain alone can autoinhibit activity in context of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment of P-Rex1 and interacts with the DH/PH domains in solution. The 3.1 Å crystal structure of DEP1 features a domain swap, similar to that observed previously in the Dvl2 DEP domain, involving an exposed basic loop that contains the PKA site. Using purified proteins, we show that although DEP1 phosphorylation has no effect on the activity or solution conformation of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment, it inhibits binding of the DEP1 domain to liposomes containing phosphatidic acid. Thus, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the DEP1 domain hampers P-Rex1 binding to negatively charged membranes in cells, freeing the DEP1 domain to associate with and inhibit the DH/PH module."	0
"32697991"	"Cell Competition, the Kinetics of Thymopoiesis, and Thymus Cellularity Are Regulated by Double-Negative 2 to 3 Early Thymocytes.Cell competition in the thymus is a homeostatic process that drives turnover. If the process is impaired, thymopoiesis can be autonomously maintained for several weeks, but this causes leukemia. We aimed to understand the effect of cell competition on thymopoiesis, identify the cells involved, and determine how the process is regulated. Using thymus transplantation experiments, we found that cell competition occurs within the double-negative 2 (DN2) and 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes and inhibits thymus autonomy. Furthermore, the expansion of DN2b is regulated by a negative feedback loop that is imposed by double-positive thymocytes and determines the kinetics of thymopoiesis. This feedback loop affects the cell cycle duration of DN2b, in a response controlled by interleukin 7 availability. Altogether, we show that thymocytes do not merely follow a pre-determined path if provided with the correct signals. Instead, thymopoiesis dynamically integrates cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous aspects that fine-tune normal thymus function."	0
"32341548"	"Pac1/LIS1 stabilizes an uninhibited conformation of dynein to coordinate its localization and activity.Dynein is a microtubule motor that transports many different cargos in various cell types and contexts. How dynein is regulated to perform these activities with spatial and temporal precision remains unclear. Human dynein is regulated by autoinhibition, whereby intermolecular contacts limit motor activity. Whether this mechanism is conserved throughout evolution, whether it can be affected by extrinsic factors, and its role in regulating dynein function remain unclear. Here, we use a combination of negative stain electron microscopy, single-molecule assays, genetic, and cell biological techniques to show that autoinhibition is conserved in budding yeast, and plays a key role in coordinating in vivo dynein function. Moreover, we find that the Lissencephaly-related protein, LIS1 (Pac1 in yeast), plays an important role in regulating dynein autoinhibition. Our studies demonstrate that, rather than inhibiting dynein motility, Pac1/LIS1 promotes dynein activity by stabilizing the uninhibited conformation, which ensures appropriate dynein localization and activity in cells."	0
"32640231"	"Neto-α Controls Synapse Organization and Homeostasis at the Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction.Glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins control receptor distribution and function, ultimately controlling synapse assembly, maturation, and plasticity. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse with both pre- and postsynaptic kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), we show that the auxiliary protein Neto evolved functionally distinct isoforms to modulate synapse development and homeostasis. Using genetics, cell biology, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that Neto-α functions on both sides of the NMJ. In muscle, Neto-α limits the size of the postsynaptic receptor field. In motor neurons (MNs), Neto-α controls neurotransmitter release in a KAR-dependent manner. In addition, Neto-α is both required and sufficient for the presynaptic increase in neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic sensitivity. This KAR-independent function of Neto-α is involved in activity-induced cytomatrix remodeling. We propose that Drosophila ensures NMJ functionality by acquiring two Neto isoforms with differential expression patterns and activities."	0
"31230815"	"TAM Kinases Promote Necroptosis by Regulating Oligomerization of MLKL.Necroptosis, a cell death pathway mediated by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling cascade downstream of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases are known for their anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and anti-inflammatory roles. Here, we identify an unexpected role of TAM kinases as promoters of necroptosis, a pro-inflammatory necrotic cell death. Pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TAM kinases results in a potent inhibition of necroptotic death in various cellular models. We identify phosphorylation of MLKL Tyr376 as a direct point of input from TAM kinases into the necroptosis signaling. The oligomerization of MLKL, but not its membranal translocation or phosphorylation by RIPK3, is controlled by TAM kinases. Importantly, both knockout and inhibition of TAM kinases protect mice from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, this study discovers that immunosuppressant TAM kinases are promoters of pro-inflammatory necroptosis, shedding light on the biological complexity of the regulation of inflammation."	1
"30853401"	"Spatiotemporal Control of ULK1 Activation by NDP52 and TBK1 during Selective Autophagy.Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis."	1
"32130892"	"Early B Cell Factor Activity Controls Developmental and Adaptive Thermogenic Gene Programming in Adipocytes.Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity protects animals against hypothermia and represents a potential therapeutic target to combat obesity. The transcription factor early B cell factor-2 (EBF2) promotes brown adipocyte differentiation, but its roles in maintaining brown adipocyte fate and in stimulating BAT recruitment during cold exposure were unknown. We find that the deletion of Ebf2 in adipocytes of mice ablates BAT character and function, resulting in cold intolerance. Unexpectedly, prolonged exposure to cold restores the thermogenic profile and function of Ebf2 mutant BAT. Enhancer profiling and genetic assays identified EBF1 as a candidate regulator of the cold response in BAT. Adipocyte-specific deletion of both Ebf1 and Ebf2 abolishes BAT recruitment during chronic cold exposure. Mechanistically, EBF1 and EBF2 promote thermogenic gene transcription through increasing the expression and activity of ERRα and PGC1α. Together, these studies demonstrate that EBF proteins specify the developmental fate and control the adaptive cold response of brown adipocytes."	0

In the LIFT pathway, lipidated cargoes are transported into the cilia through the coordinated actions of cargo carrier proteins such as Unc119 or PDE6δ, as well as small GTPases Arl13b and Arl3 in the cilium. Our previous studies have revealed a single Arl13b ortholog in the evolutionarily divergent <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. TbArl13 catalyzes two TbArl3 homologs, TbArl3A and TbArl3C, suggesting the presence of a conserved LIFT pathway in these protozoan parasites. Only a single homolog to the cargo carrier protein Unc119 has been identified in <i>T. brucei</i> genome, but its function in lipidated protein transport has not been characterized. In this study, we exploited the proximity-based biotinylation approach to identify binding partners of TbUnc119. We showed that TbUnc119 binds to a flagellar arginine kinase TbAK3 in a myristoylation-dependent manner and is responsible for its targeting to and enrichment in the flagellum. Interestingly, only TbArl3A, but not TbArl3C interacted with TbUnc119 in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting functional specialization of Arl3-GTPases in <i>T. brucei</i> These results establish the function of TbUnc119 as a myristoylated cargo carrier and support the presence of a conserved LIFT pathway in <i>T. brucei.</i>"	0

Compared to the aptamer-based MS2-MCP strategy, an optimized dCas13 system is user friendly, does not require genetic manipulation, and achieves comparable RNA-labeling efficiency. We demonstrate that the dCas13 system is capable of labeling NEAT1, SatIII, MUC4, and GCN4 RNAs and allows the study of paraspeckle-associated NEAT1 dynamics.

Important advances have been made to optimize culture conditions and define molecular criteria for naive pluripotency. However, the identity of naive-specific surface markers and the underlying molecular mechanism of naive pluripotency regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) as a prominent naive-specific surface marker by systematic proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ALPPL2 is essential for both the establishment and maintenance of naive pluripotency. Moreover, we show that ALPPL2 can interact with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 to stabilize the mRNA levels of the naive pluripotency transcription factors TFCP2L1 and STAT3 to regulate naive pluripotency. Overall, our study identifies a functional surface marker for human naive pluripotency, providing a powerful tool for human-naive-pluripotency-related mechanistic studies."	1

Where L1 integrates into the genome can directly impact human evolution and disease. Here, we experimentally induced L1 retrotransposition in cells and mapped integration sites at nucleotide resolution. At local scales, L1 integration is mostly restricted by genome sequence biases and the specificity of the L1 machinery. At regional scales, L1 shows a broad capacity for integration into all chromatin states, in contrast to other known mobile genetic elements. However, integration is influenced by the replication timing of target regions, suggesting a link to host DNA replication. The distribution of new L1 integrations differs from those of preexisting L1 copies, which are significantly reshaped by natural selection. Our findings reveal that the L1 machinery has evolved to efficiently target all genomic regions and underline a predominant role for post-integrative processes on the distribution of endogenous L1 elements."	0
"32234473"	"Nutlin-Induced Apoptosis Is Specified by a Translation Program Regulated by PCBP2 and DHX30.Activation of p53 by the small molecule Nutlin can result in a combination of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The relative strength of these events is difficult to predict by classical gene expression analysis, leaving uncertainty as to the therapeutic benefits. In this study, we report a translational control mechanism shaping p53-dependent apoptosis. Using polysome profiling, we establish Nutlin-induced apoptosis to associate with the enhanced translation of mRNAs carrying multiple copies of an identified 3' UTR CG-rich motif mediating p53-dependent death (CGPD-motif). We identify PCBP2 and DHX30 as CGPD-motif interactors. We find that in cells undergoing persistent cell cycle arrest in response to Nutlin, CGPD-motif mRNAs are repressed by the PCBP2-dependent binding of DHX30 to the motif. Upon DHX30 depletion in these cells, the translation of CGPD-motif mRNAs increases, and the response to Nutlin shifts toward apoptosis. Instead, DHX30 inducible overexpression in SJSA1 cells leads to decreased translation of CGPD-motif mRNAs."	0

To identify genes promoting tumorigenesis in combination with TP53 deficiency, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens coupled with proliferation and transformation assays in isogenic cell lines. Loss of several known tumor suppressors enhances cellular proliferation and transformation. Loss of neddylation pathway genes promotes uncontrolled proliferation exclusively in TP53-deficient cells. Combined loss of CUL3 and TP53 activates an oncogenic transcriptional program governed by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), AP-1, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways. This program maintains persistent cellular proliferation, induces partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and increases DNA damage, genomic instability, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings reveal CUL3 loss as a key event stimulating persistent proliferation in TP53-deficient cells.

SGs act as a protective mechanism to cope with acute stress, but persistent SGs have cytotoxic effects that are associated with several age-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the testis-specific protein, MAGE-B2, increases cellular stress tolerance by suppressing SG formation through translational inhibition of the key SG nucleator G3BP. MAGE-B2 reduces G3BP protein levels below the critical concentration for phase separation and suppresses SG initiation. Knockout of the MAGE-B2 mouse ortholog or overexpression of G3BP1 confers hypersensitivity of the male germline to heat stress in vivo. Thus, MAGE-B2 provides cytoprotection to maintain mammalian spermatogenesis, a highly thermosensitive process that must be preserved throughout reproductive life.

A mechanistic understanding of how eIF6 modulates translation in response to stress, specifically starvation-induced stress, is lacking. We here show a novel mode of eIF6 regulation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) that is predominantly active in response to serum starvation. Both GSK3α and GSK3β phosphorylate human eIF6. Multiple residues in the C terminus of eIF6 are phosphorylated by GSK3 in a sequential manner. In response to serum starvation, eIF6 accumulates in the cytoplasm, and this altered localization depends on phosphorylation by GSK3. Disruption of eIF6 phosphorylation exacerbates the translation inhibitory response to serum starvation and stalls cell growth. These results suggest that eIF6 regulation by GSK3 contributes to the attenuation of global protein synthesis that is critical for adaptation to starvation-induced stress."	1

Among these, GRIN2A, which encodes the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, is widely accepted as an epilepsy-causative gene. Here, we functionally characterize the de novo GluN2A-S1459G mutation identified in an epilepsy patient. We show that S1459 is a CaMKIIα phosphorylation site, and that endogenous phosphorylation is regulated during development and in response to synaptic activity in a dark rearing model. GluN2A-S1459 phosphorylation results in preferential binding of NMDARs to SNX27 and a corresponding decrease in PSD-95 binding, which consequently regulates NMDAR trafficking. Furthermore, the epilepsy-associated GluN2A-S1459G variant displays defects in interactions with both SNX27 and PSD-95, resulting in trafficking deficits, reduced spine density, and decreased excitatory synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate a role for CaMKIIα phosphorylation of GluN2A in receptor targeting and implicate NMDAR trafficking defects as a link to epilepsy."	1

Ythdf2/3 deficiency represses mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and chromatin silencing at loci containing the TEAD motif, contributing to decreased reprogramming efficiency. Moreover, RNA interference of Tgfb1 or the Hippo signaling effectors Yap1, Taz, and Tead2 rescues Ythdf2/3-defective reprogramming.

"32937135"	"The GSK-3β-FBXL21 Axis Contributes to Circadian TCAP Degradation and Skeletal Muscle Function.FBXL21 is a clock-controlled E3 ligase modulating circadian periodicity via subcellular-specific CRYPTOCHROME degradation. How FBXL21 regulates tissue-specific circadian physiology and what mechanism operates upstream is poorly understood. Here we report the sarcomere component TCAP as a cytoplasmic substrate of FBXL21. FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation. GSK-3β phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP to activate FBXL21-mediated, phosphodegron-dependent TCAP degradation. GSK-3β inhibition or knockdown diminishes FBXL21-Cul1 complex formation and delays FBXL21-mediated TCAP degradation. Finally, Psttm mice show significant skeletal muscle defects, including impaired fiber size, exercise tolerance, grip strength, and response to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy, in conjunction with cardiac dysfunction. These data highlight a circadian regulatory pathway where a GSK-3β-FBXL21 functional axis controls TCAP degradation via SCF complex formation and regulates skeletal muscle function."	1

However, the role and sequence of β cell dysfunction and mass loss for reduced insulin levels in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis are unclear. Here, we exploit freshly explanted pancreas specimens from metabolically phenotyped surgical patients using an in situ tissue slice technology. This approach allows assessment of β cell volume and function within pancreas samples of metabolically stratified individuals. We show that, in tissue of pre-diabetic, impaired glucose-tolerant subjects, β cell volume is unchanged, but function significantly deteriorates, exhibiting increased basal release and loss of first-phase insulin secretion. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, function within the sustained β cell volume further declines. These results indicate that dysfunction of persisting β cells is a key factor in the early development and progression of type 2 diabetes, representing a major target for diabetes prevention and therapy."	0

We find that FADS2 expression correlates with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity across multiple cancer types and is prognostic in some cancer types. Accordingly, activating mTOR signaling by deleting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) or overexpression of SREBP-1/2 is sufficient to increase FADS2 mRNA expression and sapienate metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and U87 glioblastoma cells, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR signaling decreases FADS2 expression and sapienate biosynthesis in MEFs with Tsc2 deletion, HUH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and orthotopic HUH7 liver xenografts. In conclusion, we show that mTOR signaling and SREBP activity are sufficient to activate sapienate metabolism by increasing FADS2 expression. Consequently, targeting mTOR signaling can reduce sapienate metabolism in vivo."	1
"31606273"	"Distinct Binding Preferences between Ras and Raf Family Members and the Impact on Oncogenic Ras Signaling.The Ras GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancer, and, although the Raf kinases are essential effectors of Ras signaling, the tumorigenic properties of specific Ras-Raf complexes are not well characterized. Here, we examine the ability of individual Ras and Raf proteins to interact in live cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology. We find that C-Raf binds all mutant Ras proteins with high affinity, whereas B-Raf exhibits a striking preference for mutant K-Ras. This selectivity is mediated by the acidic, N-terminal segment of B-Raf and requires the K-Ras polybasic region for high-affinity binding. In addition, we find that C-Raf is critical for mutant H-Ras-driven signaling and that events stabilizing B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization, such as Raf inhibitor treatment or certain B-Raf mutations, can allow mutant H-Ras to engage B-Raf with increased affinity to promote tumorigenesis, thus revealing a previously unappreciated role for C-Raf in potentiating B-Raf function."	1
"31494035"	"RNase L Reprograms Translation by Widespread mRNA Turnover Escaped by Antiviral mRNAs.In response to foreign and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), protein kinase R (PKR) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) reprogram translation in mammalian cells. PKR inhibits translation initiation through eIF2α phosphorylation, which triggers stress granule (SG) formation and promotes translation of stress responsive mRNAs. The mechanisms of RNase L-driven translation repression, its contribution to SG assembly, and its regulation of dsRNA stress-induced mRNAs are unknown. We demonstrate that RNase L drives translational shut-off in response to dsRNA by promoting widespread turnover of mRNAs. This alters stress granule assembly and reprograms translation by allowing translation of mRNAs resistant to RNase L degradation, including numerous antiviral mRNAs such as interferon (IFN)-β. Individual cells differentially activate dsRNA responses revealing variation that can affect cellular outcomes. This identifies bulk mRNA degradation and the resistance of antiviral mRNAs as the mechanism by which RNase L reprograms translation in response to dsRNA."	0

Here, we describe a mechanism of FBXL5 regulation involving its interaction with the cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex composed of MMS19, FAM96B, and CIAO1. We demonstrate that the CIA-targeting complex promotes the ability of FBXL5 to degrade IRPs. In addition, the FBXL5-CIA-targeting complex interaction is regulated by oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tension displaying a robust association in 21% O<sub>2</sub> that is severely diminished in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and contributes to O<sub>2</sub>-dependent regulation of IRP degradation. Together, these data identify a novel oxygen-dependent signaling axis that links IRP-dependent iron homeostasis with the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery."	1

However, the role of Eomes and its molecular program in mature NK cell biology is unclear. To address this, we develop a tamoxifen-inducible, type-1-ILC-specific (Ncr1-targeted) cre mouse and combine this with Eomes-floxed mice. Eomes deletion after normal NK cell ontogeny results in a rapid loss of NK cells (but not ILC1s), with a particularly profound effect on penultimately mature stage III NK cells. Mechanisms responsible for stage III reduction include increased apoptosis and impaired maturation from stage II precursors. Induced Eomes deletion also decreases NK cell cytotoxicity and abrogates in vivo rejection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class-I-deficient cells. However, other NK cell functional responses, and stage IV NK cells, are largely preserved. These data indicate that mature NK cells have distinct Eomes-dependent and -independent stages."	0
"30595436"	"Replication-Coupled DNA-Protein Crosslink Repair by SPRTN and the Proteasome in Xenopus Egg Extracts.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are bulky lesions that interfere with DNA metabolism and therefore threaten genomic integrity. Recent studies implicate the metalloprotease SPRTN in S phase removal of DPCs, but how SPRTN is targeted to DPCs during DNA replication is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN and proteasome activities are coupled to DNA replication by distinct mechanisms that promote replication across immovable protein barriers."	0
"32433965"	"Unbiased Identification of trans Regulators of ADAR and A-to-I RNA Editing.Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that deaminate adenosine to inosine. Although many RNA editing sites are known, few trans regulators have been identified. We perform BioID followed by mass spectrometry to identify trans regulators of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in HeLa and M17 neuroblastoma cells. We identify known and novel ADAR-interacting proteins. Using ENCODE data, we validate and characterize a subset of the novel interactors as global or site-specific RNA editing regulators. Our set of novel trans regulators includes all four members of the DZF-domain-containing family of proteins: ILF3, ILF2, STRBP, and ZFR. We show that these proteins interact with each ADAR and modulate RNA editing levels. We find ILF3 is a broadly influential negative regulator of editing. This work demonstrates the broad roles that RNA binding proteins play in regulating editing levels, and establishes DZF-domain-containing proteins as a group of highly influential RNA editing regulators."	1
"31735643"	"Dynamic Regulation of ME1 Phosphorylation and Acetylation Affects Lipid Metabolism and Colorectal Tumorigenesis.PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis."	1
"31968247"	"Constitutive Interferon Attenuates RIPK1/3-Mediated Cytokine Translation.Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and 3 (RIPK3) are well known for their capacity to drive necroptosis via mixed-lineage kinase-like domain (MLKL). Recently, RIPK1/3 kinase activity has been shown to drive inflammation via activation of MAPK signaling. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this kinase-dependent cytokine production remain poorly understood. In the present study, we establish that the kinase activity of RIPK1/3 regulates cytokine translation in mouse and human macrophages. Furthermore, we show that this inflammatory response is downregulated by type I interferon (IFN) signaling, independent of type I IFN-promoted cell death. Specifically, low-level constitutive IFN signaling attenuates RIPK-driven activation of cap-dependent translation initiation pathway components AKT, mTORC1, 4E-BP and eIF4E, while promoting RIPK-dependent cell death. Altogether, these data characterize constitutive IFN signaling as a regulator of RIPK-dependent inflammation and establish cap-dependent translation as a crucial checkpoint in the regulation of cytokine production."	1

We here report that PGAM1 is overexpressed in gliomas where it increases the efficiency of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by cytoplasmic binding of WIP1 phosphatase, thereby preventing WIP1 nuclear translocation and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing of PGAM1 expression in glioma cells consequently decreases formation of γ-H2AX foci, increases apoptosis, and decreases clonogenicity following irradiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with PGAM1-knockdown cells have significantly improved survival after treatment with IR and TMZ. These effects are counteracted by exogenous expression of two kinase-dead PGAM1 mutants, H186R and Y92F, indicating an important non-enzymatic function of PGAM1. Our findings identify PGAM1 as a potential therapeutic target in gliomas."	1

"32023464"	"Heterogeneity of Satellite Cells Implicates DELTA1/NOTCH2 Signaling in Self-Renewal.How satellite cells and their progenitors balance differentiation and self-renewal to achieve sustainable tissue regeneration is not well understood. A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty of studying this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identify the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity of satellite cells, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression, during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies, we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool. These findings have implications for therapeutic control of muscle regeneration."	0

It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ. Our results establish OTUB2 as an essential modulator of YAP/TAZ and also reveal a novel mechanism via which YAP/TAZ activity is induced by oncogenic KRAS."	1

We previously reported that differential degradation of TKI-sensitive (<i>e.g.</i> L858R) and resistant (T790M) EGFR mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. We also reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> ubiquitination assays, MS, and superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of EGF-bound EGFR, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown increases receptor sorting to lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown decreased EGFR steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive target to overcome TKI resistance."	1

Most germline piRNAs derive from dual-strand piRNA clusters, heterochromatic transposon graveyards that are transcribed from both genomic strands. These piRNA sources are marked by the heterochromatin protein 1 homolog Rhino (Rhi), which facilitates their promoter-independent transcription, suppresses splicing, and inhibits transcriptional termination. Here, we report that the protein Maelstrom (Mael) represses canonical, promoter-dependent transcription in dual-strand clusters, allowing Rhi to initiate piRNA precursor transcription. Mael also represses promoter-dependent transcription at sites outside clusters. At some loci, Mael repression requires the piRNA pathway, while at others, piRNAs play no role. We propose that by repressing canonical transcription of individual transposon mRNAs, Mael helps Rhi drive non-canonical transcription of piRNA precursors without generating mRNAs encoding transposon proteins."	0

Here, we use a proteomic screen to identify proteins that are ubiquitylated at cellular membranes and found that Lunapark, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping protein localized to ER three-way junctions, is ubiquitylated by the CRL3<sup>KLHL12</sup> ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that Lunapark interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1), a central cellular regulator that coordinates growth and metabolism with environmental conditions. We show that mTORC1 binds Lunapark specifically at three-way junctions, and lysosomes, where mTORC1 is activated, make contact with three-way junctions where Lunapark resides. Inhibition of Lunapark ubiquitylation results in neurodevelopmental defects indicating that KLHL12-dependent ubiquitylation of Lunapark is required for normal growth and development."	1

Using global nuclear run-on followed by sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), we show that CDK8 kinase activity promotes RNA polymerase II pause release in response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a universal cytokine involved in immunity and tumor surveillance. The Mediator kinase module contains CDK8 or CDK19, which are presumed to be functionally redundant. We implemented cortistatin A, chemical genetics, transcriptomics, and other methods to decouple their function while assessing enzymatic versus structural roles. Unexpectedly, CDK8 and CDK19 regulated different gene sets via distinct mechanisms. CDK8-dependent regulation required its kinase activity, whereas CDK19 governed IFN-γ responses through its scaffolding function (i.e., it was kinase independent). Accordingly, CDK8, not CDK19, phosphorylates the STAT1 transcription factor (TF) during IFN-γ stimulation, and CDK8 kinase inhibition blocked activation of JAK-STAT pathway TFs. Cytokines such as IFN-γ rapidly mobilize TFs to ""reprogram"" cellular transcription; our results implicate CDK8 and CDK19 as essential for this transcriptional reprogramming."	1

The anaerobic biosynthesis of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), the lower ligand of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, involves five reactions catalyzed by the <i>bza</i> operon gene products, namely the hydroxybenzimidazole synthase BzaAB/BzaF, phosphoribosyltransferase CobT, and three methyltransferases, BzaC, BzaD, and BzaE, that conduct three distinct methylation steps. Of these, the methyltransferases that contribute to benzimidazole lower ligand diversity in cobamides remain to be characterized, and the precise role of the <i>bza</i> operon protein CobT is unclear. In this study, we used the <i>bza</i> operon from the anaerobic bacterium <i>Moorella thermoacetica</i> (comprising <i>bzaA-bzaB-cobT-bzaC</i>) to examine the role of CobT and investigate the activity of the first methyltransferase, BzaC.

We uncover an essential role for the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in epicardial invasion and differentiation. Using scRNA-seq, we show that epicardial-specific deletion of Prmt1 reduced matrix and ribosomal gene expression in epicardial-derived cell lineages. PRMT1 regulates splicing of Mdm4, which is a key controller of p53 stability. Loss of PRMT1 leads to accumulation of p53 that enhances Slug degradation and blocks EMT. During heart development, the PRMT1-p53 pathway is required for epicardial invasion and formation of epicardial-derived lineages: cardiac fibroblasts, coronary smooth muscle cells, and pericytes.

Using photoactivated localization microscopy and single-molecule tracking, we demonstrate that Hfq forms a distinct and reversible focus-like structure in <i>Escherichia coli</i> specifically experiencing long-term nitrogen starvation. Using the ability of T7 phage to replicate in nitrogen-starved bacteria as a biological probe of <i>E. coli</i> cell function during nitrogen starvation, we demonstrate that Hfq foci have a role in the adaptive response of <i>E. coli</i> to long-term nitrogen starvation. We further show that Hfq foci formation does not depend on gene expression once nitrogen starvation has set in and occurs indepen-dently of the transcription factor N-regulatory protein C, which activates the initial adaptive response to N starvation in <i>E. coli</i> These results serve as a paradigm to demonstrate that bacterial adaptation to long-term nutrient starvation can be spatiotemporally coordinated and can occur independently of <i>de novo</i> gene expression during starvation."	0
"31000436"	"Mouse ANKRD31 Regulates Spatiotemporal Patterning of Meiotic Recombination Initiation and Ensures Recombination between X and Y Sex Chromosomes.Orderly segregation of chromosomes during meiosis requires that crossovers form between homologous chromosomes by recombination. Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate meiotic recombination. We identify ANKRD31 as a key component of complexes of DSB-promoting proteins that assemble on meiotic chromosome axes. Genome-wide, ANKRD31 deficiency causes delayed recombination initiation. In addition, loss of ANKRD31 alters DSB distribution because of reduced selectivity for sites that normally attract DSBs. Strikingly, ANKRD31 deficiency also abolishes uniquely high rates of recombination that normally characterize pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of X and Y chromosomes. Consequently, sex chromosomes do not form crossovers, leading to chromosome segregation failure in ANKRD31-deficient spermatocytes. These defects co-occur with a genome-wide delay in assembling DSB-promoting proteins on autosome axes and loss of a specialized PAR-axis domain that is highly enriched for DSB-promoting proteins in wild type. Thus, we propose a model for spatiotemporal patterning of recombination by ANKRD31-dependent control of axis-associated DSB-promoting proteins."	0

Here, we report an unanticipated cell-death- and inflammation-independent function of RIPK1 and Caspase-8, promoting faithful chromosome alignment in mitosis and thereby ensuring genome stability. We find that ripoptosome complexes progressively form as cells enter mitosis, peaking at metaphase and disassembling as cells exit mitosis. Genetic deletion and mitosis-specific inhibition of Ripk1 or Caspase-8 results in chromosome alignment defects independently of MLKL. We found that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited into mitotic ripoptosomes, where PLK1's activity is controlled via RIPK1-dependent recruitment and Caspase-8-mediated cleavage. A fine balance of ripoptosome assembly is required as deregulated ripoptosome activity modulates PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as BUBR1.

Once stimulated, they rapidly undergo dynamic changes in gene expression to adopt an activated phenotype capable of stimulating immune responses. We find that the microRNA miR-9 is upregulated in both bone marrow-derived DCs and conventional DC1s but not in conventional DC2s following stimulation. miR-9 expression in BMDCs and conventional DC1s promotes enhanced DC activation and function, including the ability to stimulate T cell activation and control tumor growth. We find that miR-9 regulated the expression of several negative regulators of transcription, including the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group factor 6 (Pcgf6). These findings demonstrate that miR-9 facilitates the transition of DCs from steady state to mature state by regulating the expression of several negative regulators of DC function in a cell-type-specific manner."	1
"30554945"	"Target-Specific Precision of CRISPR-Mediated Genome Editing.The CRISPR-Cas9 system has successfully been adapted to edit the genome of various organisms. However, our ability to predict the editing outcome at specific sites is limited. Here, we examined indel profiles at over 1,000 genomic sites in human cells and uncovered general principles guiding CRISPR-mediated DNA editing. We find that precision of DNA editing (i.e., recurrence of a specific indel) varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly preferred indel and others displaying numerous infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency and a preference for single-nucleotide homologous insertions. Precise targets and editing outcome can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Indel profiles are robust, but they can be influenced by chromatin features. Our findings have important implications for clinical applications of CRISPR technology and reveal general patterns of broken end joining that can provide insights into DNA repair mechanisms."	0
"32580946"	"Muscarinic-dependent phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor by protein kinase G is mediated by PI3K-AKT-nNOS signaling.Post-translational modifications of proteins involved in calcium handling in myocytes, such as the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), critically regulate cardiac contractility. Recent studies have suggested that phosphorylation of RyR2 by protein kinase G (PKG) might contribute to the cardioprotective effects of cholinergic stimulation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, using murine ventricular myocytes, immunoblotting, proximity ligation as-says, and nitric oxide imaging, we report that phosphorylation of Ser-2808 in RyR2 induced by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol is mediated by a signaling axis comprising phosphoinositide 3-phosphate kinase, Akt Ser/Thr kinase, nitric oxide synthase 1, nitric oxide, soluble guanylate cyclase, cyclic GMP (cGMP), and PKG. We found that this signaling pathway is compartmentalized in myocytes, as it was distinct from atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-cGMP-PKG-RyR2 Ser-2808 signaling and independent of muscarinic-induced phosphorylation of Ser-239 in vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. These results provide detailed insights into muscarinic-induced PKG signaling and the mediators that regulate cardiac RyR2 phosphorylation critical for cardiovascular function."	1
"32610137"	"Promiscuous Binding of Microprotein Mozart1 to γ-Tubulin Complex Mediates Specific Subcellular Targeting to Control Microtubule Array Formation.How γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a master template for microtubule nucleation, is spatially and temporally regulated for the assembly of new microtubule arrays remains unclear. Here, we report that an evolutionarily conserved microprotein, Mozart1 (Mzt1), regulates subcellular targeting and microtubule formation activity of γ-TuRC at different cell cycle stages. Crystal structures of protein complexes demonstrate that Mzt1 promiscuously interacts with the N-terminal domains of multiple γ-tubulin complex protein subunits in γ-TuRC via an intercalative binding mode. Genetic- and microscopy-based analyses show that promiscuous binding of Mzt1 in γ-TuRC controls specific subcellular localization of γ-TuRC to modulate microtubule nucleation and stabilization in fission yeast. Moreover, we find Mzt1-independent targeting of γ-TuRC to be crucial for mitotic spindle assembly, demonstrating the cell-cycle-dependent regulation and function of γ-TuRC. Our findings reveal a microprotein-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying microtubule cytoskeleton formation, whereby Mzt1 binding promiscuity confers localization specificity on the multi-protein complex γ-TuRC."	0
"32611769"	"Methyltransferase-like 21C (METTL21C) methylates alanine tRNA synthetase at Lys-943 in muscle tissue.Protein-lysine methylation is a common posttranslational modification (PTM) throughout the human proteome that plays important roles in diverse biological processes. In humans, there are >100 known and candidate protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs), many of which are linked to human diseases. Methyltransferase-like protein 21C (METTL21C) is a PKMT implicated in muscle biology that has been reported to methylate valosin-containing protein/p97 (VCP) and heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8). However, a clear <i>in vitro</i> methyltransferase activity for METTL21C remains yet to be demonstrated, and whether it is an active enzyme that directly methylates substrate(s) <i>in vivo</i> is unclear. Here, we used an unbiased biochemistry-based screening assay coupled to MS, which identified alanine tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) as a direct substrate of METTL21C. We found that METTL21C catalyzes methylation of Lys-943 of AARS1 (AARS1-K943me) both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i><i>In vitro</i> METTL21C-mediated AARS1 methylation was independent of ATP or tRNA molecules. Unlike for AARS1, and in conflict with previous reports, we did not detect METTL21C methylation of VCP and HSPA8. AARS1-K943 methylation in HEK293T cells depends upon METTL21C levels. Finally, METTL2C was almost exclusively expressed in muscle tissue, and, accordingly, we detected METTL21C-catalyzed methylation of AARS1 in mouse skeletal muscle tissue. These results reveal that AARS1 is a <i>bona fide in vitro</i> substrate of METTL21C and suggest a role for the METTL21C-AARS1 axis in the regulation of protein synthesis in muscle tissue. Moreover, our study describes a straightforward protocol for elucidating the physiological substrates of poorly characterized or uncharacterized PKMTs."	1
"32561545"	"Human RTEL1 associates with Poldip3 to facilitate responses to replication stress and R-loop resolution.RTEL1 helicase is a component of DNA repair and telomere maintenance machineries. While RTEL1's role in DNA replication is emerging, how RTEL1 preserves genomic stability during replication remains elusive. Here we used a range of proteomic, biochemical, cell, and molecular biology and gene editing approaches to provide further insights into potential role(s) of RTEL1 in DNA replication and genome integrity maintenance. Our results from complementary human cell culture models established that RTEL1 and the Polδ subunit Poldip3 form a complex and are/function mutually dependent in chromatin binding after replication stress. Loss of RTEL1 and Poldip3 leads to marked R-loop accumulation that is confined to sites of active replication, enhances endogenous replication stress, and fuels ensuing genomic instability. The impact of depleting RTEL1 and Poldip3 is epistatic, consistent with our proposed concept of these two proteins operating in a shared pathway involved in DNA replication control under stress conditions. Overall, our data highlight a previously unsuspected role of RTEL1 and Poldip3 in R-loop suppression at genomic regions where transcription and replication intersect, with implications for human diseases including cancer."	1
"32697984"	"RSK2 Maintains Adult Estrogen Homeostasis by Inhibiting ERK1/2-Mediated Degradation of Estrogen Receptor Alpha.In response to estrogens, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a critical regulator of homeostasis, is degraded through the 26S proteasome. However, despite the continued presence of estrogen before menopause, ERα protein levels are maintained. We discovered that ERK1/2-RSK2 activity oscillates during the estrous cycle. In response to high estrogen levels, ERK1/2 is activated and phosphorylates ERα to drive ERα degradation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Reduction of estrogen levels results in ERK1/2 deactivation. RSK2 maintains redox homeostasis, which prevents sustained ERK1/2 activation. In juveniles, ERK1/2-RSK2 activity is not required. Mammary gland regeneration demonstrates that ERK1/2-RSK2 regulation of ERα is intrinsic to the epithelium. Reduced RSK2 and enrichment in an estrogen-regulated gene signature occur in individuals taking oral contraceptives. RSK2 loss enhances DNA damage, which may account for the elevated breast cancer risk with the use of exogenous estrogens. These findings implicate RSK2 as a critical component for the preservation of estrogen homeostasis."	1
"32460017"	"Pyruvate Kinase M2 Promotes the Activation of Dendritic Cells by Enhancing IL-12p35 Expression.Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging evidence has demonstrated metabolic reprogramming during DC activation. However, how DC activation is linked with metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here we show that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the last step of glycolysis, is critical for LPS-induced DC activation. Upon DC activation, JNK signaling stimulated p300 association with PKM2 for the acetylation of lysine 433, a classic posttranslational modification critical for PKM2 destabilization and nuclear re-localization. Subsequently, nuclear PKM2 partnered with c-Rel to enhance Il12p35 expression, which is important for Th1 cell differentiation. Meanwhile, decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 due to detetramerization facilitated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, helping DCs meet their need for biomacromolecules. Together, we provide evidence for metabolic control of DC activation and offer insights into aberrant immune responses due to dysregulated Th1 functions."	1
"30612879"	"The Crohn's Disease Risk Factor IRGM Limits NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Impeding Its Assembly and by Mediating Its Selective Autophagy.Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn's disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders."	1
"32115408"	"Cerebral organoid and mouse models reveal a RAB39b-PI3K-mTOR pathway-dependent dysregulation of cortical development leading to macrocephaly/autism phenotypes.Dysregulation of early neurodevelopment is implicated in macrocephaly/autism disorders. However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in human cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene <i>RAB39b</i> are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain remain unknown. We generated <i>Rab39b</i> knockout (KO) mice and found that they exhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD behaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human cerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation and impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble neurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b interacts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly enhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely detectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling rescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by <i>RAB39b</i> mutations. Therefore, <i>RAB39b</i> mutation promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity and alters cortical neurogenesis, leading to macrocephaly and autistic-like behaviors. Our studies provide new insights into neurodevelopmental dysregulation and common pathways associated with ASD across species."	1

"32049014"	"Hepatic DNAJB9 Drives Anabolic Biasing to Reduce Steatosis and Obesity.Nutrients stimulate the anabolic synthesis of proteins and lipids, but selective insulin resistance in obesity biases the anabolic program toward lipogenesis. Here, we report the identification of a DNAJB9-driven program that favors protein synthesis and energy production over lipid accumulation. We show there are two pools of DNAJB9 cochaperone. DNAJB9 in the ER lumen promotes the degradation of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1c through ERAD, whereas its counterpart on the ER membrane promotes the assembly of mTORC2 in the cytosol and stimulates the synthesis of proteins and ATP. The expression of Dnajb9 is induced by nutrients and downregulated in the obese mouse liver. Restoration of hepatic DNAJB9 expression effectively improves insulin sensitivity, restores protein synthesis, and suppresses food intake, accompanied by reduced hepatic steatosis and adiposity in multiple mouse models of obesity. Therefore, targeting the anabolic balance may provide a unique opportunity to tackle obesity and diabetes."	1
"32846122"	"Transite: A Computational Motif-Based Analysis Platform That Identifies RNA-Binding Proteins Modulating Changes in Gene Expression.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play critical roles in regulating gene expression by modulating splicing, RNA stability, and protein translation. Stimulus-induced alterations in RBP function contribute to global changes in gene expression, but identifying which RBPs are responsible for the observed changes remains an unmet need. Here, we present Transite, a computational approach that systematically infers RBPs influencing gene expression through changes in RNA stability and degradation. As a proof of principle, we apply Transite to RNA expression data from human patients with non-small-cell lung cancer whose tumors were sampled at diagnosis or after recurrence following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Transite implicates known RBP regulators of the DNA damage response and identifies hnRNPC as a new modulator of chemotherapeutic resistance, which we subsequently validated experimentally. Transite serves as a framework for the identification of RBPs that drive cell-state transitions and adds additional value to the vast collection of publicly available gene expression datasets."	0
"31837995"	"Polycomb Group Proteins Regulate Chromatin Architecture in Mouse Oocytes and Early Embryos.In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reorganization during oocyte development. However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs. These data reveal a critical role of Polycomb in regulating chromatin architecture during mammalian oocyte growth and early development."	0

Here, we identify Pvt1b, a p53-dependent isoform of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Pvt1, expressed 50 kb downstream of Myc, which becomes induced by DNA damage or oncogenic signaling and accumulates near its site of transcription. We show that production of the Pvt1b RNA is necessary and sufficient to suppress Myc transcription in cis without altering the chromatin organization of the locus. Inhibition of Pvt1b increases Myc levels and transcriptional activity and promotes cellular proliferation. Furthermore, Pvt1b loss accelerates tumor growth, but not tumor progression, in an autochthonous mouse model of lung cancer. These findings demonstrate that Pvt1b acts at the intersection of the p53 and Myc transcriptional networks to reinforce the anti-proliferative activities of p53."	1
"31812350"	"Targeting UBE4A Revives Viperin Protein in Epithelium to Enhance Host Antiviral Defense.Mutation and prevalence of pathogenic viruses prompt the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Viperin is a potent antiviral protein that inhibits a broad range of viruses. Unexpectedly, we found that Viperin protein production in epithelium is defective in response to both viruses and interferons (IFNs). We further revealed that viruses and IFNs stimulate expression of the acetyltransferase HAT1, which induces Lys197-acetylation on Viperin. Viperin acetylation in turn recruits UBE4A that stimulates K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys206 of Viperin, leading to Viperin protein degradation. Importantly, UBE4A deficiency restores Viperin protein production in epithelium. We then designed interfering peptides (IPs) to inhibit UBE4A binding with Viperin. We found that VIP-IP3 rescues Viperin protein production in epithelium and therefore enhances cellular antiviral activity. VIP-IP3 renders mice more resistant to viral infection. These findings could provide strategies for both enhancing host broad-spectrum antiviral response and improving the efficacy of IFN-based antiviral therapy."	1

However, how maternally supplied transcripts are dynamically regulated during MZT remains largely unknown. Herein, through genome-wide profiling of RNA 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) modification in zebrafish early embryos, we found that m<sup>5</sup>C-modified maternal mRNAs display higher stability than non-m<sup>5</sup>C-modified mRNAs during MZT. We discovered that Y-box binding protein 1 (Ybx1) preferentially recognizes m<sup>5</sup>C-modified mRNAs through π-π interactions with a key residue, Trp45, in Ybx1's cold shock domain (CSD), which plays essential roles in maternal mRNA stability and early embryogenesis of zebrafish. Together with the mRNA stabilizer Pabpc1a, Ybx1 promotes the stability of its target mRNAs in an m<sup>5</sup>C-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates an unexpected mechanism of RNA m<sup>5</sup>C-regulated maternal mRNA stabilization during zebrafish MZT, highlighting the critical role of m<sup>5</sup>C mRNA modification in early development."	1
"31735641"	"Cancer-Derived Succinate Promotes Macrophage Polarization and Cancer Metastasis via Succinate Receptor.Macrophages form a major cell population in the tumor microenvironment. They can be activated and polarized into tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) by the tumor-derived soluble molecules to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we used comparative metabolomics coupled with biochemical and animal studies to show that cancer cells release succinate into their microenvironment and activate succinate receptor (SUCNR1) signaling to polarize macrophages into TAM. Furthermore, the results from in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that succinate promotes not only cancer cell migration and invasion but also cancer metastasis. These effects are mediated by SUCNR1-triggered PI3K-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) axis. Compared with healthy subjects and tumor-free lung tissues, serum succinate levels and lung cancer SUCNR1 expression were elevated in lung cancer patients, suggesting an important clinical relevance. Collectively, our findings indicate that the secreted tumor-derived succinate belongs to a novel class of cancer progression factors, controlling TAM polarization and promoting tumorigenic signaling."	1
"32075755"	"ELAC1 Repairs tRNAs Cleaved during Ribosome-Associated Quality Control.Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) disassembles aberrantly stalled translation complexes to recycle or degrade the constituent parts. A key step of RQC is the cleavage of P-site tRNA by the endonuclease ANKZF1 (Vms1 in yeast) to release incompletely synthesized polypeptides from ribosomes for degradation. Re-use of the cleaved tRNA for translation requires re-addition of the universal 3'CCA nucleotides removed by ANKZF1. Here, we show that ELAC1 is both necessary and sufficient to remove the 2',3'-cyclic phosphate on ANKZF1-cleaved tRNAs to permit CCA re-addition by TRNT1. ELAC1 activity is optimized for tRNA recycling, whereas ELAC2, the essential RNase Z isoform in eukaryotes, is required to remove 3' trailers during tRNA biogenesis. Cells lacking ELAC1 specifically accumulate unrepaired tRNA intermediates upon the induction of ribosome stalling. Thus, optimal recycling of ANKZF1-cleaved tRNAs in vertebrates is achieved through the duplication and specialization of a conserved tRNA biosynthesis enzyme."	0
"31757755"	"A Non-amyloid Prion Particle that Activates a Heritable Gene Expression Program.Spatiotemporal gene regulation is often driven by RNA-binding proteins that harbor long intrinsically disordered regions in addition to folded RNA-binding domains. We report that the disordered region of the evolutionarily ancient developmental regulator Vts1/Smaug drives self-assembly into gel-like condensates. These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid, yet they are infectious, allowing them to act as a protein-based epigenetic element: a prion [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>].

We show that maternally deposited Bmp1a plays an unexpected and non-redundant role in establishing the BMP signaling gradient, while the Bmp1a/Tolloid antagonist Sizzled is surprisingly dispensable. Combining computational modeling and in vivo analyses with an immobile Chordin construct, we demonstrate that long-range Chordin diffusion is not necessary for BMP gradient formation and DV patterning.

By performing a genome-wide screen, we identified Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 1 (SFMBT1) as a candidate pVHL target. SFMBT1 was considered to be a transcriptional repressor but its role in cancer remains unclear. ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations displayed elevated SFMBT1 protein levels. SFMBT1 hydroxylation on Proline residue 651 by EglN1 mediated its ubiquitination and degradation governed by pVHL. Depletion of SFMBT1 abolished ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Integrated analyses of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and patient prognosis identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a key SFMBT1 target gene contributing to its oncogenic phenotype.

In-depth understanding of the SFTSV-induced pathogenesis mechanism is critical for developing effective anti-SFTS therapeutics. Here, we report transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from SFTS patients. We observe a strong correlation between inflammatory responses and disease progression and fatal outcome. Quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV infection confirms the induction of inflammation and further reveals virus-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, SFTSV infection triggers BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK) upregulation and BAK/BCL2-associated X (BAX) activation, leading to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidization and subsequent cytosolic release. The cytosolic mtDNA binds and triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, the BAK expression level correlates with SFTS disease progression and fatal outcome.

Here, we introduce Inter-ViSTA (Interaction Visualization in Space and Time Analysis), a web-based platform that quickly builds animated protein interaction networks and automatically synthesizes information on protein abundances, functions, complexes, and subcellular localizations. Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical for mitochondrial integrity.

"32006464"	"Localized Inhibition of Protein Phosphatase 1 by NUAK1 Promotes Spliceosome Activity and Reveals a MYC-Sensitive Feedback Control of Transcription.Deregulated expression of MYC induces a dependence on the NUAK1 kinase, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this dependence have not been fully clarified. Here, we show that NUAK1 is a predominantly nuclear protein that associates with a network of nuclear protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interactors and that PNUTS, a nuclear regulatory subunit of PP1, is phosphorylated by NUAK1. Both NUAK1 and PNUTS associate with the splicing machinery. Inhibition of NUAK1 abolishes chromatin association of PNUTS, reduces spliceosome activity, and suppresses nascent RNA synthesis. Activation of MYC does not bypass the requirement for NUAK1 for spliceosome activity but significantly attenuates transcription inhibition. Consequently, NUAK1 inhibition in MYC-transformed cells induces global accumulation of RNAPII both at the pause site and at the first exon-intron boundary but does not increase mRNA synthesis. We suggest that NUAK1 inhibition in the presence of deregulated MYC traps non-productive RNAPII because of the absence of correctly assembled spliceosomes."	1

The observed recruitment facilitates subsequent recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex. Depletion of WRNIP1 sensitizes cells to ICL-forming drugs. We find that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its UBZ domain are required to facilitate recruitment of FANCD2/FANCI and promote repair.

This metabolism-epigenome link sensitizes chromatin methylation to altered SAM abundance, yet the mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt and protect epigenetic information during life-experienced fluctuations in SAM availability are unknown. We identified a robust response to SAM depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under SAM-depleted conditions, H3K9 mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to SAM depletion in vivo.

E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3A interact with the cyclin box of cyclin F via their conserved N-terminal cyclin binding motifs. In the short term, E2F mutants unable to bind cyclin F remain stable throughout the cell cycle, induce unscheduled transcription in G2 and mitosis, and promote faster entry into the next S phase. However, in the long term, they impair cell fitness. We propose that by restricting E2F activity to the S phase, cyclin F controls one of the main and most critical transcriptional engines of the cell cycle."	1
"31628042"	"PTPS Facilitates Compartmentalized LTBP1 S-Nitrosylation and Promotes Tumor Growth under Hypoxia.GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR) are sequentially responsible for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a known co-factor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The implication of BH4-biosynthesis process in tumorigenesis remains to be investigated. Here, we show that PTPS, which is highly expressed in early-stage colorectal cancer, is phosphorylated at Thr 58 by AMPK under hypoxia; this phosphorylation promotes PTPS binding to LTBP1 and subsequently drives iNOS-mediated LTBP1 S-nitrosylation through proximal-coupling BH4 production within the PTPS/iNOS/LTBP1 complex. In turn, LTBP1 S-nitrosylation results in proteasome-dependent LTBP1 protein degradation, revealing an inverse relationship between PTPS pT58 and LTBP1 stability. Physiologically, the repressive effect of PTPS on LTBP1 leads to impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and thereby maintains tumor cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LTBP1-TGF-β signaling by the BH4-biosynthesis pathway and highlight the specific requirement of PTPS for tumor growth."	1
"32075764"	"Nef-Mediated CD3-TCR Downmodulation Dampens Acute Inflammation and Promotes SIV Immune Evasion.The inability of Nef to downmodulate the CD3-T cell receptor (TCR) complex distinguishes HIV-1 from other primate lentiviruses and may contribute to its high virulence. However, the role of this Nef function in virus-mediated immune activation and pathogenicity remains speculative. Here, we selectively disrupted this Nef activity in SIV<sub>mac239</sub> and analyzed the consequences for the virological, immunological, and clinical outcome of infection in rhesus macaques. The inability to downmodulate CD3-TCR does not impair viral replication during acute infection but is associated with increased immune activation and antiviral gene expression. Subsequent early reversion in three of six animals suggests strong selective pressure for this Nef function and is associated with high viral loads and progression to simian AIDS. In the absence of reversions, however, viral replication and the clinical course of infection are attenuated. Thus, Nef-mediated downmodulation of CD3 dampens the inflammatory response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and seems critical for efficient viral immune evasion."	0
"31126739"	"Transcription Restart Establishes Chromatin Accessibility after DNA Replication.DNA replication is highly disruptive to chromatin, leading to eviction of nucleosomes, RNA polymerase, and regulatory factors. When and how transcription resumes on DNA following DNA replication is unknown. Here we develop a replication-coupled assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (repli-ATAC-seq) to investigate active chromatin restoration post-replication in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that nascent chromatin is inaccessible and transcriptionally silenced, with accessibility and RNA polymerase occupancy re-appearing within 30 minutes. Chromatin accessibility restores differentially genome wide, with super enhancers regaining transcription factor occupancy faster than other genomic features. We also identify opportunistic and transiently accessible chromatin within gene bodies after replication. Systematic inhibition of transcription shows that transcription restart is required to re-establish active chromatin states genome wide and resolve opportunistic binding events resulting from DNA replication. Collectively, this establishes a central role for transcription in overcoming the genome-wide chromatin inaccessibility imposed by DNA replication every cell division."	0
"31708417"	"ATR Protects the Genome against R Loops through a MUS81-Triggered Feedback Loop.R loops arising during transcription induce genomic instability, but how cells respond to the R loop-associated genomic stress is still poorly understood. Here, we show that cells harboring high levels of R loops rely on the ATR kinase for survival. In response to aberrant R loop accumulation, the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 pathway is activated by R loop-induced reversed replication forks. In contrast to the activation of ATR by replication inhibitors, R loop-induced ATR activation requires the MUS81 endonuclease. ATR protects the genome from R loops by suppressing transcription-replication collisions, promoting replication fork recovery, and enforcing a G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, ATR prevents excessive cleavage of reversed forks by MUS81, revealing a MUS81-triggered and ATR-mediated feedback loop that fine-tunes MUS81 activity at replication forks. These results suggest that ATR is a key sensor and suppressor of R loop-induced genomic instability, uncovering a signaling circuitry that safeguards the genome against R loops."	1

While KynA is generated locally within the nervous system, its precursor, kynurenine (Kyn), is largely derived from peripheral resources. The mechanisms that import Kyn into the nervous system are poorly understood.

While novel biotechnology undoubtedly offers benefits, like all new technology, precautions should be considered during implementation to reduce the risk of both known and unknown adverse effects. To achieve containment of transgenic microorganisms, confidence to a near-scientific certainty that they cannot transfer their transgenic genes to other organisms, and that they cannot survive to propagate in unintended environments, is a priority. Here, we present an in-depth summary of biological containment systems for micro-organisms published to date, including the production of a genetic firewall through genome recoding and physical containment of microbes using auxotrophies, regulation of essential genes, and expression of toxic genes. The level of containment required to consider a transgenic organism suitable for deployment is discussed, as well as standards of practice for developing new containment systems."	0

In this study, we report that the expression of MED16 is markedly decreased in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) tumors compared with normal thyroid tissues. <i>In vitro</i>, MED16 overexpression in PTC cells significantly inhibited cell migration, enhanced sodium/iodide symporter expression and iodine uptake, and decreased resistance to radioactive <sup>131</sup>I (RAI). Conversely, PTC cells in which MED16 had been further knocked down (MED16<sup>KD</sup>) exhibited enhanced cell migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and RAI resistance, accompanied by decreased sodium/iodide symporter levels. Moreover, cell signaling through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) was highly activated after the MED16 knockdown. Similar results were obtained in MED12<sup>KD</sup> PTC cells, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment verified interactions between MED16 and MED12 and between MED16 and TGF-βR2. Of note, the application of LY2157299, a potent inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, significantly attenuated MED16<sup>KD</sup>-induced RAI resistance both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> In conclusion, our findings indicate that MED16 reduction in PTC contributes to tumor progression and RAI resistance via the activation of the TGF-β pathway."	1

Reduced expression of PDX1 is thought to contribute to β-cell loss and dysfunction in diabetes. Thus, promoting PDX1 expression can be an effective strategy to preserve β-cell mass and function. Previously, we established a <i>PDX1</i> promoter-dependent luciferase system to screen agents that can promote PDX1 expression. Natural compound tectorigenin (TG) was identified as a promising candidate that could enhance the activity of the promoter for the <i>PDX1</i> gene. In this study, we first demonstrated that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in β-cells via activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of ERK; this effect was observed under either normal or glucotoxic/lipotoxic conditions. We then found that TG could suppress induced apoptosis and improved the viability of β-cells under glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by activation of ERK and reduction of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects held true <i>in vivo</i> as well: prophylactic or therapeutic use of TG could obviously inhibit ER stress and decrease islet β-cell apoptosis in the pancreas of mice given a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD), thus dramatically maintaining or restoring β-cell mass and islet size, respectively. Accordingly, both prophylactic and therapeutic use of TG improved HFHSD-impaired glucose metabolism in mice, as evidenced by ameliorating hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Taken together, TG, as an agent promoting PDX1 expression exhibits strong protective effects on islet β-cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."	1

A variety of <i>FOXC1</i> mutants have been identified in patients diagnosed with the autosomal dominant disease Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which is mainly characterized by abnormal development of the eyes, particularly those who also have accompanying congenital heart defects (CHD). However, the role of FOXC1 in CHD, and how these mutations might impact FOXC1 function, remains elusive. Our previous work provided one clue to possible function, demonstrating that zebrafish <i>foxc1a</i>, an orthologue of human <i>FOXC1</i> essential for heart development, directly regulates the expression of <i>nkx2.5</i>, encoding a transcriptional regulator of cardiac progenitor cells. Abnormal expression of <i>Nkx2-5</i> leads to CHD in mice and is also associated with CHD patients. Whether this link extends to the human system, however, requires investigation. In this study, we demonstrate that FOXC1 does regulate human <i>NKX2-5</i> expression in a dose-dependent manner via direct binding to its proximal promoter. A comparison of FOXC1 mutant function in the rat cardiac cell line H9c2 and zebrafish embryos suggested that the zebrafish embryos might serve as a more representative model system than the H9c2 cells. Finally, we noted that three of the Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome FOXC1 mutations tested increased, whereas a fourth repressed the expression of <i>NKX2-5</i> These results imply that mutant FOXC1s might play etiological roles in CHD by abnormally regulating <i>NKX2-5</i> in the patients. And zebrafish embryos can serve as a useful <i>in vivo</i> platform for rapidly evaluating disease-causing roles of mutated genes."	1
"32605925"	"A distinct talin2 structure directs isoform specificity in cell adhesion.Integrin receptors regulate normal cellular processes such as signaling, cell migration, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and leukocyte function. Talin recruitment to the membrane is necessary for its binding to and activation of integrin. Vertebrates have two highly conserved talin homologs that differ in their expression patterns. The F1-F3 FERM subdomains of cytoskeletal proteins resemble a cloverleaf, but in talin1, its F1 subdomain and additional F0 subdomain align more linearly with its F2 and F3 subdomains. Here, we present the talin2 crystal structure, revealing that its F0-F1 di-subdomain displays another unprecedented constellation, whereby the F0-F1-F2 adopts a new cloverleaf-like arrangement. Using multiangle light scattering (MALS), fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), and FRET analyses, we found that substituting the corresponding residues in talin2 that abolish lipid binding in talin1 disrupt the binding of talin to the membrane, focal adhesion formation, and cell spreading. Our results provide the molecular details of the functions of specific talin isoforms in cell adhesion."	0

However, we found that knockdown of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first oxiPPP enzyme, did not affect AMPK activation despite decreased Ru-5-P and subsequent LKB1 activation, due to enhanced activity of PP2A, the upstream phosphatase of AMPK. In contrast, knockdown of 6PGD or 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGLS), the second oxiPPP enzyme, reduced PP2A activity. Mechanistically, knockdown of G6PD or PGLS decreased or increased 6-phosphogluconolactone level, respectively, which enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of PP2A by Src. Furthermore, γ-6-phosphogluconolactone, an oxiPPP byproduct with unknown function generated through intramolecular rearrangement of δ-6-phosphogluconolactone, the only substrate of PGLS, bound to Src and enhanced PP2A recruitment.

Pharmacological tools specifically targeting TMEM16 CaPLSases are urgently needed to understand these novel membrane transporters and their contributions to health and disease. Tannic acid (TA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were recently reported as promising TMEM16F CaPLSase inhibitors. However, our present study shows that TA and EGCG do not inhibit the phospholipid-scrambling or ion conduction activities of the dual-functional TMEM16F. Instead, we found that TA and EGCG mainly acted as fluorescence quenchers that rapidly suppress the fluorophores conjugated to annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-binding probe commonly used to report on TMEM16 CaPLSase activity. These data demonstrate the false positive effects of TA and EGCG on inhibiting TMEM16F phospholipid scrambling and discourage the use of these polyphenols as CaPLSase inhibitors.

We first develop SOT to analyze cell fate continuum from Oct4/Sox2/Klf4- or OSK-mediated reprogramming and show that cells bifurcate into two categories, reprogramming potential (RP) or non-reprogramming (NR). We further show that Klf4 contributes to Cd34+/Fxyd5+/Psca+ keratinocyte-like NR fate and that IFN-γ impedes the final transition to chimera-competent pluripotency along the RP cells. We analyze more than 150,000 single cells from both OSK and chemical reprograming and identify additional NR/RP bifurcation points. Our work reveals a generic bifurcation model for cell fate decisions during somatic cell reprogramming that may be applicable to other systems and inspire further improvements for reprogramming."	0

Typically, bnAbs develop in patients with high viremia, but they can also evolve in some untreated HIV-1 controllers with low viral loads. Here, we identify a subgroup of neutralizer-controllers characterized by myeloid DCs (mDCs) with a distinct inflammatory signature and a superior ability to prime T follicular helper (Tfh)-like cells in an STAT4-dependent fashion. This distinct immune profile is associated with a higher frequency of Tfh-like cells in peripheral blood (pTfh) and an enrichment for Tfh-defining genes in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Correspondingly, monocytes from this neutralizer controller subgroup upregulate genes encoding for chemotaxis and inflammation, and they secrete high levels of IL-12 in response to TLR stimulation.

Inhibition of TORC1 leads to reduced protein translation, which promotes longevity. TORC1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of protein translation has been well studied, while analogous transcriptional regulation is less understood. Here we screen fission yeast mutants for resistance to Torin1, which inhibits TORC1 and cell growth. Cells lacking the GATA factor Gaf1 (gaf1Δ) grow normally even in high doses of Torin1. The gaf1Δ mutation shortens the chronological lifespan of non-dividing cells and diminishes Torin1-mediated longevity. Expression profiling and genome-wide binding experiments show that upon TORC1 inhibition, Gaf1 directly upregulates genes for small-molecule metabolic pathways and indirectly represses genes for protein translation. Surprisingly, Gaf1 binds to and downregulates the tRNA genes, so it also functions as a transcription factor for RNA polymerase III.

BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy."	1

It remains unclear how the changing information in a growing nascent polypeptide dictates the recruitment of functionally distinct chaperones. Here, we used ribosome profiling to define the principles governing the cotranslational action of the chaperones TRiC/CCT and Hsp70/Ssb. We show that these chaperones are sequentially recruited to specific sites within domain-encoding regions of select nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 associates first, binding select sites throughout domains, whereas TRiC associates later, upon the emergence of nearly complete domains that expose an unprotected hydrophobic surface. This suggests that transient topological properties of nascent folding intermediates drive sequential chaperone association. Moreover, cotranslational recruitment of both TRiC and Hsp70 correlated with translation elongation slowdowns. We propose that the temporal modulation of the nascent chain structural landscape is coordinated with local elongation rates to regulate the hierarchical action of Hsp70 and TRiC for cotranslational folding."	0

Here, we perform a screening of a cDNA library containing 2,500 nuclear proteins and identify hHR23A as a histone H4K20 demethylase. Overexpression of hHR23A reduces the levels of H4K20me1/2/3 in cells. In vitro, hHR23A specifically demethylates H4K20me1/2/3 and generates formaldehyde.

We further demonstrate that hHR23A/B activate the transcription of coding genes by demethylating H4K20me1 and the transcription of repetitive elements by demethylating H4K20me3. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses demonstrate that an HxxxE motif in the UBA1 domain is crucial for iron binding and demethylase activity.

PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are used clinically to treat BRCA-mutated breast tumors. Using a genetic screen, we identified EMI1 as a modulator of PARPi sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This function requires the F-box domain of EMI1, through which EMI1 assembles a canonical SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that constitutively targets RAD51 for degradation. In response to genotoxic stress, CHK1-mediated phosphorylation of RAD51 counteracts EMI1-dependent degradation by enhancing RAD51's affinity for BRCA2, leading to RAD51 accumulation. Inhibition of RAD51 degradation restores HRR in BRCA1-depleted cells. Human breast cancer samples display an inverse correlation between EMI1 and RAD51 protein levels. A subset of BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells develop resistance to PARPi by downregulating EMI1 and restoring RAD51-dependent HRR.

"32049027"	"Nanoscale Remodeling of Functional Synaptic Vesicle Pools in Hebbian Plasticity.Vesicle pool properties are known determinants of synaptic efficacy, but their potential role as modifiable substrates in forms of Hebbian plasticity is still unclear. Here, we investigate this using a nanoscale readout of functionally recycled vesicles in natively wired hippocampal CA3→CA1 circuits undergoing long-term potentiation (LTP). We show that the total recycled vesicle pool is larger after plasticity induction, with the smallest terminals exhibiting the greatest relative expansion. Changes in the spatial organization of vesicles accompany potentiation including a specific increase in the number of recycled vesicles at the active zone, consistent with an ultrastructural remodeling component of synaptic strengthening. The cAMP-PKA pathway activator, forskolin, selectively mimics some features of LTP-driven changes, suggesting that distinct and independent modules of regulation accompany plasticity expression. Our findings provide evidence for a presynaptic locus of LTP encoded in the number and arrangement of functionally recycled vesicles, with relevance for models of long-term plasticity storage."	0
"32679077"	"Acetylation-Dependent Deubiquitinase OTUD3 Controls MAVS Activation in Innate Antiviral Immunity.Accurate regulation of innate immunity is necessary for the host to efficiently respond to invading pathogens and avoid excessive harmful immune pathology. Here we identified OTUD3 as an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinase that restricts innate antiviral immune signaling. OTUD3 deficiency in mice results in enhanced innate immunity, a diminished viral load, and morbidity. OTUD3 directly hydrolyzes lysine 63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and thus shuts off innate antiviral immune response. Notably, the catalytic activity of OTUD3 relies on acetylation of its Lys129 residue. In response to virus infection, the acetylated Lys129 is removed by SIRT1, which promptly inactivates OTUD3 and thus allows timely induction of innate antiviral immunity. Importantly, acetyl-OTUD3 levels are inversely correlated with IFN-β expression in influenza patients. These findings establish OTUD3 as a repressor of MAVS and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the catalytic activity of OTUD3 is tightly controlled to ensure timely activation of antiviral defense."	1
"32130890"	"Regulated Proteolysis of MutSγ Controls Meiotic Crossing Over.Crossover recombination is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. The MutSγ complex, Msh4-Msh5, facilitates crossing over by binding and stabilizing nascent recombination intermediates. We show that these activities are governed by regulated proteolysis. MutSγ is initially inactive for crossing over due to an N-terminal degron on Msh4 that renders it unstable by directly targeting proteasomal degradation. Activation of MutSγ requires the Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 (DDK), which directly phosphorylates and thereby neutralizes the Msh4 degron. Genetic requirements for Msh4 phosphorylation indicate that DDK targets MutSγ only after it has bound to nascent joint molecules (JMs) in the context of synapsing chromosomes. Overexpression studies confirm that the steady-state level of Msh4, not phosphorylation per se, is the critical determinant for crossing over. At the DNA level, Msh4 phosphorylation enables the formation and crossover-biased resolution of double-Holliday Junction intermediates. Our study establishes regulated protein degradation as a fundamental mechanism underlying meiotic crossing over."	1

Here, we generated and characterized a pre-osteoblast and differentiating chondrocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i> conditional knockout mouse model to study RUNX1's function in bone formation. <i>Runx1</i> ablation in osteoblast precursors and differentiating chondrocytes via osterix-Cre (Osx-Cre) resulted in an osteoporotic phenotype and decreased bone density in the long bones and skulls of <i>Runx1<sup>f/f</sup>Osx-Cre</i> mice compared with <i>Runx1<sup>f/f</sup></i> and <i>Osx-Cre</i> mice. RUNX1 deficiency reduced the expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), Indian hedgehog signaling molecule (IHH), Patched (PTC), and cyclin D1 in the growth plate, and also reduced the expression of osteocalcin (OCN), OSX, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and RUNX2 in osteoblasts. ChIP assays and promoter activity mapping revealed that RUNX1 directly associates with the <i>Runx2</i> gene promoter and up-regulates <i>Runx2</i> expression. Furthermore, the ChIP data also showed that RUNX1 associates with the <i>Ocn</i> promoter. In conclusion, RUNX1 up-regulates the expression of <i>Runx2</i> and multiple bone-specific genes, and plays an indispensable role in bone formation and homeostasis in both trabecular and cortical bone. We propose that stimulating <i>Runx1</i> activity may be useful in therapeutic approaches for managing some bone diseases such as osteoporosis."	1
"32726616"	"PHF7 Modulates BRDT Stability and Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis.Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system."	1

"32320661"	"Genome-wide Profiling Identifies DNA Methylation Signatures of Aging in Rod Photoreceptors Associated with Alterations in Energy Metabolism.Aging-associated functional decline is accompanied by alterations in the epigenome. To explore DNA modifications that could influence visual function with age, we perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of purified mouse rod photoreceptors at four ages and identify 2,054 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We detect many DMRs during early stages of aging and in rod regulatory regions, and some of these cluster at chromosomal hotspots, especially on chromosome 10, which includes a longevity interactome. Integration of methylome to age-related transcriptome changes, chromatin signatures, and first-order protein-protein interactions uncover an enrichment of DMRs in altered pathways that are associated with rod function, aging, and energy metabolism. In concordance, we detect reduced basal mitochondrial respiration and increased fatty acid dependency with retinal age in ex vivo assays. Our study reveals age-dependent genomic and chromatin features susceptible to DNA methylation changes in rod photoreceptors and identifies a link between DNA methylation and energy metabolism in aging."	0
"32251399"	"LSM2-8 and XRN-2 contribute to the silencing of H3K27me3-marked genes through targeted RNA decay.In fission yeast and plants, RNA processing and degradation contribute to heterochromatin silencing, alongside conserved pathways of transcriptional repression. It has not been known whether similar pathways exist in metazoans. Here, we describe a pathway of silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cells, in which the highly conserved RNA-binding complex LSM2-8 contributes selectively to the repression of heterochromatic reporters and endogenous genes bearing the Polycomb mark, histone H3K27me3. This acts by degrading selected transcripts through the XRN-2 exoribonuclease. Disruption of the LSM2-8 pathway leads to mRNA stabilization. Unlike previously described pathways of heterochromatic RNA degradation, LSM2-8-mediated RNA degradation does not target nor require H3K9 methylation. Intriguingly, loss of this pathway coincides with a localized reduction in H3K27me3 at lsm-8-sensitive loci. We have thus uncovered a mechanism of RNA degradation that selectively contributes to the silencing of a subset of H3K27me3-marked genes, revealing a previously unrecognized layer of post-transcriptional control in metazoan heterochromatin."	0
"32719012"	"A cytoskeletal protein complex is essential for division of intracellular amastigotes of <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>.Previous studies in <i>Leishmania mexicana</i> have identified the cytoskeletal protein KHARON as being important for both flagellar trafficking of the glucose transporter GT1 and for successful cytokinesis and survival of infectious amastigote forms inside mammalian macrophages. KHARON is located in three distinct regions of the cytoskeleton: the base of the flagellum, the subpellicular microtubules, and the mitotic spindle. To deconvolve the different functions for KHARON, we have identified two partner proteins, KHAP1 and KHAP2, which associate with KHARON. KHAP1 is located only in the subpellicular microtubules, whereas KHAP2 is located at the subpellicular microtubules and the base of the flagellum. Both <i>KHAP1</i> and <i>KHAP2</i> null mutants are unable to execute cytokinesis but are able to traffic GT1 to the flagellum. These results confirm that KHARON assembles into distinct functional complexes and that the subpellicular complex is essential for cytokinesis and viability of disease-causing amastigotes but not for flagellar membrane trafficking."	0
"32640215"	"Kinetic Heterogeneity of Cancer Cell Fractional Killing.Lethal drugs can induce incomplete cell death in a population of cancer cells, a phenomenon referred to as fractional killing. Here, we show that high-throughput population-level time-lapse imaging can be used to quantify fractional killing in response to hundreds of different drug treatments in parallel. We find that stable intermediate levels of fractional killing are uncommon, with many drug treatments resulting in complete or near-complete eradication of all cells, if given enough time. The kinetics of fractional killing over time vary substantially as a function of drug, drug dose, and genetic background. At the molecular level, the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of the kinetics of fractional killing in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli. These studies suggest that fractional killing is governed by diverse lethal stimulus-specific mechanisms."	0

"30879903"	"MDM2 Integrates Cellular Respiration and Apoptotic Signaling through NDUFS1 and the Mitochondrial Network.Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2."	1
"31759821"	"Fork Cleavage-Religation Cycle and Active Transcription Mediate Replication Restart after Fork Stalling at Co-transcriptional R-Loops.Formation of co-transcriptional R-loops underlies replication fork stalling upon head-on transcription-replication encounters. Here, we demonstrate that RAD51-dependent replication fork reversal induced by R-loops is followed by the restart of semiconservative DNA replication mediated by RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases, MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, RAD52 strand-annealing factor, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)/XRCC4 complex, and the non-catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, POLD3. RECQ5 disrupts RAD51 filaments assembled on stalled forks after RECQ1-mediated reverse branch migration, preventing a new round of fork reversal and facilitating fork cleavage by MUS81/EME1. MUS81-dependent DNA breaks accumulate in cells lacking RAD52 or LIG4 upon induction of R-loop formation, suggesting that RAD52 acts in concert with LIG4/XRCC4 to catalyze fork religation, thereby mediating replication restart. The resumption of DNA synthesis after R-loop-associated fork stalling also requires active transcription, the restoration of which depends on MUS81, RAD52, LIG4, and the transcription elongation factor ELL. These findings provide mechanistic insights into transcription-replication conflict resolution."	0
"32075754"	"Sen1 Is Recruited to Replication Forks via Ctf4 and Mrc1 and Promotes Genome Stability.DNA replication and RNA transcription compete for the same substrate during S phase. Cells have evolved several mechanisms to minimize such conflicts. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the transcription termination helicase Sen1 associates with replisomes. We show that the N terminus of Sen1 is both sufficient and necessary for replisome association and that it binds to the replisome via the components Ctf4 and Mrc1. We generated a separation of function mutant, sen1-3, which abolishes replisome binding without affecting transcription termination. We observe that the sen1-3 mutants show increased genome instability and recombination levels. Moreover, sen1-3 is synthetically defective with mutations in genes involved in RNA metabolism and the S phase checkpoint. RNH1 overexpression suppresses defects in the former, but not the latter. These findings illustrate how Sen1 plays a key function at replication forks during DNA replication to promote fork progression and chromosome stability."	1
"32846130"	"BIRC2 Expression Impairs Anti-Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy Efficacy.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has led to therapeutic responses in some cancer patients for whom no effective treatment previously existed. ICB acts on T lymphocytes and other immune cells that are inactivated due to checkpoint signals that inhibit their infiltration and function within tumors. But for more than 80% of patients, immunotherapy has not been effective. Here, we demonstrate a cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to ICB mediated by baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2). Knockdown of BIRC2 expression in mouse melanoma or breast cancer cells increases expression of the chemokine CXCL9 and impairs tumor growth by increasing the number of intratumoral activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells. Administration of anti-CXCL9 neutralizing antibody inhibits the recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells to BIRC2-deficient tumors. Most importantly, BIRC2 deficiency dramatically increases the sensitivity of mouse melanoma and breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD1 ICB."	1
"31733993"	"Lineage-Restricted Regulation of SCD and Fatty Acid Saturation by MITF Controls Melanoma Phenotypic Plasticity.Phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity within tumors is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. How metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. In melanoma, downregulation of the lineage addiction oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, although how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here, we show that MITF is a lineage-restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and that SCD is required for MITF<sup>High</sup> melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITF<sup>Low</sup> cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signaling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback loop that maintains de-differentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineage-specific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates the response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism."	1
"32402289"	"Foxo3 Promotes the Differentiation and Function of Follicular Helper T Cells.Follicular helper T cells (Tfhs) are essential for germinal center (GC) B cell maturation and antibody development. However, the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate Tfh differentiation are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the frequencies of Tfhs and GC B cells, as well as interleukin-21 (IL-21) and anti-ovalbumin (OVA) antibodies, are markedly decreased in forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) knockout mice immunized with OVA. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras and lymphocyte-repopulated Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice proves that wild-type (WT), but not Foxo3-deficient T cells provoke GC B cell maturation and antibody production. Deficiency of Foxo3 inhibits inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)-induced Tfh differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results suggest that Foxo3 is able to bind to the IL-21 promoter and regulate IL-21 secretion. In conclusion, our study unveils a critical role of Foxo3 in the regulation of Tfh differentiation and IL-21 production. Modulating Foxo3 activity may be beneficial for enhancing or preventing antibody-mediated immune responses."	1
"31402096"	"Bicoid-Dependent Activation of the Target Gene hunchback Requires a Two-Motif Sequence Code in a Specific Basal Promoter.In complex genetic loci, individual enhancers interact most often with specific basal promoters. Here we investigate the activation of the Bicoid target gene hunchback (hb), which contains two basal promoters (P1 and P2). Early in embryogenesis, P1 is silent, while P2 is strongly activated. In vivo deletion of P2 does not cause activation of P1, suggesting that P2 contains intrinsic sequence motifs required for activation. We show that a two-motif code (a Zelda binding site plus TATA) is required and sufficient for P2 activation. Zelda sites are present in the promoters of many embryonically expressed genes, but the combination of Zelda plus TATA does not seem to be a general code for early activation or Bicoid-specific activation per se. Because Zelda sites are also found in Bicoid-dependent enhancers, we propose that simultaneous binding to both enhancers and promoters independently synchronizes chromatin accessibility and facilitates correct enhancer-promoter interactions."	0
"32755576"	"Stromal Cell-Contact Dependent PI3K and APRIL Induced NF-κB Signaling Prevent Mitochondrial- and ER Stress Induced Death of Memory Plasma Cells.The persistence of long-lived memory plasma cells in the bone marrow depends on survival factors available in the bone marrow, which are provided in niches organized by stromal cells. Using an ex vivo system in which we supply the known survival signals, direct cell contact to stromal cells, and the soluble cytokine a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), we have elucidated the critical signaling pathways required for the survival of long-lived plasma cells. Integrin-mediated contact of bone marrow plasma cells with stromal cells activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, leading to critical inactivation of Forkhead-Box-Protein O1/3 (FoxO1/3) and preventing the activation of mitochondrial stress-associated effector caspases 3 and 7. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K signaling in vivo ablates bone marrow plasma cells. APRIL signaling, by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, blocks activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-associated initiator caspase 12. Thus, stromal-cell-contact-induced PI3K and APRIL-induced NF-κB signaling provide the necessary and complementary signals to maintain bone marrow memory plasma cells."	1

However, the specific functional roles that Caspr2 plays in the central nervous system and their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report on a functional role for Caspr2 in the developing cerebellum. Using a combination of confocal microscopy, biochemical analyses, and behavioral testing, we show that loss of Caspr2 in the <i>Cntnap2</i><sup>-/-</sup> knockout mouse results in impaired Purkinje cell dendritic development, altered intracellular signaling, and motor coordination deficits. We also find that Caspr2 is highly enriched at synaptic specializations in the cerebellum. Using a proteomics approach, we identify type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R1) as a specific synaptic interaction partner of the Caspr2 extracellular domain in the molecular layer of the developing cerebellum. The interaction of the Caspr2 extracellular domain with IP<sub>3</sub>R1 inhibits IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Together, our work defines a mechanism by which Caspr2 controls the development and function of the cerebellum and advances our understanding of how Caspr2 dysfunction might lead to specific brain disorders."	1

Inflammasome-activated caspases are known to cleave cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Here, we found that apoptotic caspases are critically involved in regulating both DNA and RNA virus-triggered host defenses, in which activated caspase-3 cleaved cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 to prevent cytokine overproduction. Caspase-3 was exclusively required in human cells, whereas caspase-7 was involved only in murine cells to inactivate cGAS, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. Caspase-mediated cGAS cleavage was enhanced in the presence of dsDNA. Alternative MAVS cleavage sites were used to ensure the inactivation of this critical protein. Elevated type I IFNs were detected in caspase-3-deficient cells without any infection. Casp3<sup>-/-</sup> mice consistently showed increased resistance to viral infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic caspases control innate immunity and maintain immune homeostasis against viral infection."	1
"32763910"	"miR760 regulates ATXN1 levels via interaction with its 5' untranslated region.Identifying modifiers of dosage-sensitive genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders is imperative to discover novel genetic risk factors and potential therapeutic entry points. In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (<i>ATXN1</i>), a dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate <i>ATXN1</i> expression remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that <i>ATXN1</i>'s unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator that binds to a conserved site in <i>ATXN1</i>'s 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the possibility that noncoding mutations in the <i>ATXN1</i> locus may act as risk factors for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias."	1
"32668201"	"Structural Insights of Transcriptionally Active, Full-Length Androgen Receptor Coactivator Complexes.Steroid receptors activate gene transcription by recruiting coactivators to initiate transcription of their target genes. For most nuclear receptors, the ligand-dependent activation function domain-2 (AF-2) is a primary contributor to the nuclear receptor (NR) transcriptional activity. In contrast to other steroid receptors, such as ERα, the activation function of androgen receptor (AR) is largely dependent on its ligand-independent AF-1 located in its N-terminal domain (NTD). It remains unclear why AR utilizes a different AF domain from other receptors despite that NRs share similar domain organizations. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of DNA-bound full-length AR and its complex structure with key coactivators, SRC-3 and p300. AR dimerization follows a unique head-to-head and tail-to-tail manner. Unlike ERα, AR directly contacts a single SRC-3 and p300. The AR NTD is the primary site for coactivator recruitment. The structures provide a basis for understanding assembly of the AR:coactivator complex and its domain contributions for coactivator assembly and transcriptional regulation."	0

It binds histone H3K9me2/3 and hemi-methylated DNA and recruits DNMT1 to DNA replication forks during S phase. However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival. These results reveal that precise regulation of UHRF1 acetylation is required to maintain DNA methylation during cell division and control cell survival."	1
"30797686"	"Continued Activity of the Pioneer Factor Zelda Is Required to Drive Zygotic Genome Activation.Reprogramming cell fate during the first stages of embryogenesis requires that transcriptional activators gain access to the genome and remodel the zygotic transcriptome. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether the continued activity of these pioneering factors is required throughout zygotic genome activation or whether they are only required early to establish cis-regulatory regions. To address this question, we developed an optogenetic strategy to rapidly and reversibly inactivate the master regulator of genome activation in Drosophila, Zelda. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that continued Zelda activity is required throughout genome activation. We show that Zelda binds DNA in the context of nucleosomes and suggest that this allows Zelda to occupy the genome despite the rapid division cycles in the early embryo. These data identify a powerful strategy to inactivate transcription factor function during development and suggest that reprogramming in the embryo may require specific, continuous pioneering functions to activate the genome."	0

In contrast, little is known about how these areas integrate memory information to lead to similar decisions. Using serial order learning, we explore how fragments of information, learned and stored independently (e.g., A > B and B > C), are linked in an abstract representation according to their reciprocal relations (such as A > B > C) and how this representation can be accessed and manipulated to make decisions. We show that manipulating information after learning occurs with increased difficulty as logical relationships get closer in the mental map and that the activity of neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) encodes the difficulty level during target selection for motor decision making at the single-neuron and population levels."	0

Here, we demonstrate that periostin deficiency significantly inhibits the occurrence of colorectal cancer in azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice. Moreover, periostin deficiency attenuates the severity of colitis and reduces the proliferation of tumor cells. Mechanistically, stromal fibroblast-derived periostin activates FAK-Src kinases through integrin-mediated outside-in signaling, which results in the activation of YAP/TAZ and, subsequently, IL-6 expression in tumor cells. Conversely, IL-6 induces periostin expression in fibroblasts by activating STAT3, which ultimately facilitates colorectal tumor development. These findings provide the evidence that periostin promotes colorectal tumorigenesis, and identify periostin- and IL-6-mediated tumor-stroma interaction as a promising target for treating colitis-associated colorectal cancer."	1
"32203415"	"Copper is an essential regulator of the autophagic kinases ULK1/2 to drive lung adenocarcinoma.Although the transition metal copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient that is conventionally viewed as a static cofactor within enzyme active sites, a non-traditional role for Cu as a modulator of kinase signalling is emerging. Here, we found that Cu is required for the activity of the autophagic kinases ULK1 and ULK2 (ULK1/2) through a direct Cu-ULK1/2 interaction. Genetic loss of the Cu transporter Ctr1 or mutations in ULK1 that disrupt the binding of Cu reduced ULK1/2-dependent signalling and the formation of autophagosome complexes. Increased levels of intracellular Cu are associated with starvation-induced autophagy and are sufficient to enhance ULK1 kinase activity and, in turn, autophagic flux. The growth and survival of lung tumours driven by KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> is diminished in the absence of Ctr1, is dependent on ULK1 Cu binding and is associated with reduced levels of autophagy and signalling. These findings suggest a molecular basis for exploiting Cu-chelation therapy to prevent autophagy signalling to limit proliferation and improve patient survival in cancer."	1

Promoting brown-like features in WAT has been an attractive therapeutic approach for obesity. However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p) catalyzes N-α-acetylation of nascent proteins, and overexpression of human Naa10p is linked to cancer development. Here, we report that both conventional and adipose-specific Naa10p deletions in mice result in increased energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and beige adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Naa10p acetylates the N terminus of Pgc1α, which prevents Pgc1α from interacting with Pparγ to activate key genes, such as Ucp1, involved in beige adipocyte function. Consistently, fat tissues of obese human individuals show higher NAA10 expression. Thus, Naa10p-mediated N-terminal acetylation of Pgc1α downregulates thermogenic gene expression, making inhibition of Naa10p enzymatic activity a potential strategy for treating obesity."	1

ILCs, not T and B cells, are required for the development of pericarditis. ILC2s transferred to the heart of Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup> mice restore their susceptibility to eosinophil infiltration. Moreover, ILC2s direct cardiac fibroblasts to produce eotaxin-1. We also find that eosinophils reside in the mediastinal cavity and that eosinophils transferred to the mediastinal cavity of eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA1 mice following IL-33 treatment migrate to the heart. Thus, the serous cavities may serve as a reservoir of cardiac-infiltrating eosinophils. In humans, patients with pericarditis show higher amounts of ILCs in pericardial fluid than do healthy controls and patients with other cardiac diseases.

The desire to map and quantify these interactions has resulted in the development of high-throughput (HTP) quantitative measurement techniques, such as microarray or fluorescence polarization assays. For example, in the last 15 years, experiments have progressed from measuring single interactions to covering 500,000 of the 5.5 million possible SH2-pTyr interactions in the human proteome. However, high variability in affinity measurements and disagreements about positive interactions between published data sets led us here to reevaluate the analysis methods and raw data of published SH2-pTyr HTP experiments. We identified several opportunities for improving the identification of positive and negative interactions and the accuracy of affinity measurements. We implemented model-fitting techniques that are more statistically appropriate for the nonlinear SH2-pTyr interaction data. We also developed a method to account for protein concentration errors due to impurities and degradation or protein inactivity and aggregation. Our revised analysis increases the reported affinity accuracy, reduces the false-negative rate, and increases the amount of useful data by adding reliable true-negative results. We demonstrate improvement in classification of binding <i>versus</i> nonbinding when using machine-learning techniques, suggesting improved coherence in the reanalyzed data sets. We present revised SH2-pTyr affinity results and propose a new analysis pipeline for future HTP measurements of domain-peptide interactions."	0

We found that the differential response is attributable to the lack of expression of the adaptor protein TIRAP in naive T cells. TIRAP expression is induced upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and sustained by strong interleukin-2 (IL-2) signals. Expression of TIRAP requires TCR- and IL-2-induced mTORC1 activation. TLR2 stimulation induced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and ERK, leading to much higher production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by T helper 1 (Th1) cells cultured in a high concentration of IL-2 than by those cultured in a low concentration of IL-2. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation induces mTORC1 activation through TIRAP, which is essential for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production. These data demonstrate that the mTORC1 signal confers the response to TLR2 signaling by inducing TIRAP expression and that the TIRAP-mTORC1 axis is critical for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production by effector T cells."	1
"31542297"	"Glutarylation of Histone H4 Lysine 91 Regulates Chromatin Dynamics.Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure and dynamics during various DNA-associated processes. Here, we report that lysine glutarylation (Kglu) occurs at 27 lysine residues on human core histones. Using semi-synthetic glutarylated histones, we show that an evolutionarily conserved Kglu at histone H4K91 destabilizes nucleosome in vitro. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replacement of H4K91 by glutamate that mimics Kglu influences chromatin structure and thereby results in a global upregulation of transcription and defects in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and telomere silencing. In mammalian cells, H4K91glu is mainly enriched at promoter regions of highly expressed genes. A downregulation of H4K91glu is tightly associated with chromatin condensation during mitosis and in response to DNA damage. The cellular dynamics of H4K91glu is controlled by Sirt7 as a deglutarylase and KAT2A as a glutaryltransferase. This study designates a new histone mark (Kglu) as a new regulatory mechanism for chromatin dynamics."	1
"32101751"	"TIFAB Regulates USP15-Mediated p53 Signaling during Stressed and Malignant Hematopoiesis.TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain B (TIFAB) is implicated in myeloid malignancies with deletion of chromosome 5q. Employing a combination of proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that TIFAB regulates ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Expression of TIFAB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) permits USP15 signaling to substrates, including MDM2 and KEAP1, and mitigates p53 expression. Consequently, TIFAB-deficient HSPCs exhibit compromised USP15 signaling and are sensitized to hematopoietic stress by derepression of p53. In MLL-AF9 leukemia, deletion of TIFAB increases p53 signaling and correspondingly decreases leukemic cell function and development of leukemia. Restoring USP15 expression partially rescues the function of TIFAB-deficient MLL-AF9 cells. Conversely, elevated TIFAB represses p53, increases leukemic progenitor function, and correlates with MLL gene expression programs in leukemia patients. Our studies uncover a function of TIFAB as an effector of USP15 activity and rheostat of p53 signaling in stressed and malignant HSPCs."	1

Rapid advances in chemical biology and functional genomics have facilitated exploration of targeting epigenetic proteins, yielding effective strategies to target transcription while reducing toxicities to untransformed cells. Here, we review recent developments in conventional active site and allosteric inhibitors, peptidomimetics, and novel proteolysis-targeted chimera (PROTAC) technology that have deepened our understanding of transcriptional processes and led to promising preclinical compounds for therapeutic translation, particularly in cancer."	0
"32587090"	"The WD40-repeat protein WDR-48 promotes the stability of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP-46 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation.Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification that has emerged as a critical regulator of synapse development and function. However, the mechanisms that regulate the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins are poorly understood. We have previously shown that the DUB ubiquitin-specific protease 46 (USP-46) removes ubiquitin from the glutamate receptor GLR-1 and regulates its trafficking and degradation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> We found that the WD40-repeat proteins WDR-20 and WDR-48 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of USP-46. Here, we identified another mechanism by which WDR-48 regulates USP-46. We found that increased expression of WDR-48, but not WDR-20, promotes USP-46 abundance in mammalian cells in culture and in <i>C. elegans</i> neurons <i>in vivo</i> Inhibition of the proteasome increased USP-46 abundance, and this effect was nonadditive with increased WDR-48 expression. We found that USP-46 is ubiquitinated and that expression of WDR-48 reduces the levels of ubiquitin-USP-46 conjugates and increases the <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> of USP-46. A point-mutated WDR-48 variant that disrupts binding to USP-46 was unable to promote USP-46 abundance <i>in vivo</i> Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>wdr48</i> destabilizes USP46 in mammalian cells. Together, these results support a model in which WDR-48 binds and stabilizes USP-46 protein levels by preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of USP-46 in the proteasome. Given that a large number of USPs interact with WDR proteins, we propose that stabilization of DUBs by their interacting WDR proteins may be a conserved and widely used mechanism that controls DUB availability and function."	1
"32482893"	"A-kinase-anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1)-based signaling complexes coordinate local protein synthesis at the mitochondrial surface.Compartmentalization of macromolecules is a ubiquitous molecular mechanism that drives numerous cellular functions. The appropriate organization of enzymes in space and time enables the precise transmission and integration of intracellular signals. Molecular scaffolds constrain signaling enzymes to influence the regional modulation of these physiological processes. Mitochondrial targeting of protein kinases and protein phosphatases provides a means to locally control the phosphorylation status and action of proteins on the surface of this organelle. Dual-specificity protein kinase A anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1) is a multivalent binding protein that targets protein kinase A (PKA), RNAs, and other signaling enzymes to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Many AKAPs recruit a diverse set of binding partners that coordinate a broad range of cellular processes. Here, results of MS and biochemical analyses reveal that dAKAP1 anchors additional components, including the ribonucleoprotein granule components La-related protein 4 (LARP4) and polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1). Local translation of mRNAs at organelles is a means to spatially control the synthesis of proteins. RNA-Seq data demonstrate that dAKAP1 binds mRNAs encoding proteins required for mitochondrial metabolism, including succinate dehydrogenase. Functional studies suggest that the loss of dAKAP1-RNA interactions reduces mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. Hence, dAKAP1 plays a previously unappreciated role as a molecular interface between second messenger signaling and local protein synthesis machinery."	1
"30661982"	"Light Regulates Plant Alternative Splicing through the Control of Transcriptional Elongation.Light makes carbon fixation possible, allowing plant and animal life on Earth. We have previously shown that light regulates alternative splicing in plants. Light initiates a chloroplast retrograde signaling that regulates nuclear alternative splicing of a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana transcripts. Here, we show that light promotes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation in the affected genes, whereas in darkness, elongation is lower. These changes in transcription are consistent with elongation causing the observed changes in alternative splicing, as revealed by different drug treatments and genetic evidence. The light control of splicing and elongation is abolished in an Arabidopsis mutant defective in the transcription factor IIS (TFIIS). We report that the chloroplast control of nuclear alternative splicing in plants responds to the kinetic coupling mechanism found in mammalian cells, providing unique evidence that coupling is important for a whole organism to respond to environmental cues."	0
"32561640"	"The guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV3 participates in ERBB4-mediated cancer cell migration.ERBB4 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that regulates cellular processes including proliferation, migration, and survival. ERBB4 signaling is involved in embryogenesis and homeostasis of healthy adult tissues, but also in human pathologies such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Here, an MS-based analysis revealed the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (VAV3), an activator of Rho family GTPases, as a critical ERBB4-interacting protein in breast cancer cells. We confirmed the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction by targeted MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments and further defined it by demonstrating that kinase activity and Tyr-1022 and Tyr-1162 of ERBB4, as well as the intact phosphotyrosine-interacting SH2 domain of VAV3, are necessary for this interaction. We found that ERBB4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the VAV3 activation domain, known to be required for guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of VAV proteins. In addition to VAV3, the other members of the VAV family, VAV1 and VAV2, also coprecipitated with ERBB4. Analyses of the effects of overexpression of dominant-negative VAV3 constructs or shRNA-mediated down-regulation of VAV3 expression in breast cancer cells indicated that active VAV3 is involved in ERBB4-stimulated cell migration. These results define the VAV GEFs as effectors of ERBB4 activity in a signaling pathway relevant for cancer cell migration."	1
"32610139"	"Atrx Deletion in Neurons Leads to Sexually Dimorphic Dysregulation of miR-137 and Spatial Learning and Memory Deficits.ATRX gene mutations have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disabilities in humans. ATRX is known to maintain genomic stability in neuroprogenitor cells, but its function in differentiated neurons and memory processes remains largely unresolved. Here, we show that the deletion of neuronal Atrx in mice leads to distinct hippocampal structural defects, fewer presynaptic vesicles, and an enlarged postsynaptic area at CA1 apical dendrite-axon junctions. We identify male-specific impairments in long-term contextual memory and in synaptic gene expression, linked to altered miR-137 levels. We show that ATRX directly binds to the miR-137 locus and that the enrichment of the suppressive histone mark H3K27me3 is significantly reduced upon the loss of ATRX. We conclude that the ablation of ATRX in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to sexually dimorphic effects on miR-137 expression and on spatial memory, identifying a potential therapeutic target for neurological defects caused by ATRX dysfunction."	1
"32839549"	"Epigenetic silencing of the ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL7 impairs c-SRC degradation and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis.Epigenetic plasticity is a pivotal factor that drives metastasis. Here, we show that the promoter of the gene that encodes the ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL7 is hypermethylated in advanced prostate and pancreatic cancers, correlating with decreased FBXL7 mRNA and protein levels. Low FBXL7 mRNA levels are predictive of poor survival in patients with pancreatic and prostatic cancers. FBXL7 mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of active c-SRC after its phosphorylation at Ser 104. The DNA-demethylating agent decitabine recovers FBXL7 expression and limits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in a c-SRC-dependent manner. In vivo, FBXL7-depleted cancer cells form tumours with a high metastatic burden. Silencing of c-SRC or treatment with the c-SRC inhibitor dasatinib together with FBXL7 depletion prevents metastases. Furthermore, decitabine reduces metastases derived from prostate and pancreatic cancer cells in a FBXL7-dependent manner. Collectively, this research implicates FBXL7 as a metastasis-suppressor gene and suggests therapeutic strategies to counteract metastatic dissemination of pancreatic and prostatic cancer cells."	1
"31995759"	"PRMT1 Is Recruited via DNA-PK to Chromatin Where It Sustains the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype in Response to Cisplatin.Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is overexpressed in various human cancers and linked to poor response to chemotherapy. Various PRMT1 inhibitors are currently under development; yet, we do not fully understand the mechanisms underpinning PRMT1 involvement in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified PRMT1 as regulator of arginine methylation in ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin. We showed that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) binds to and phosphorylates PRMT1 in response to cisplatin, inducing its chromatin recruitment and redirecting its enzymatic activity toward Arg3 of histone H4 (H4R3). On chromatin, the DNA-PK/PRMT1 axis induces senescence-associated secretory phenotype through H4R3me2a deposition at pro-inflammatory gene promoters. Finally, PRMT1 inhibition reduces the clonogenic growth of cancer cells exposed to low doses of cisplatin, sensitizing them to apoptosis. While unravelling the role of PRMT1 in response to genotoxic agents, our findings indicate the possibility of targeting PRMT1 to overcome chemoresistance in cancer."	1
"32294442"	"A Localized Scaffold for cGMP Increase Is Required for Apical Dendrite Development.Studies in cultured neurons have established that axon specification instructs neuronal polarization and is necessary for dendrite development. However, dendrite formation in vivo occurs when axon formation is prevented. The mechanisms promoting dendrite development remain elusive. We find that apical dendrite development is directed by a localized cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-synthesizing complex. We show that the scaffolding protein Scribble associates with cGMP-synthesizing enzymes soluble-guanylate-cyclase (sGC) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The Scribble scaffold is preferentially localized to and mediates cGMP increase in dendrites. These events are regulated by kinesin KifC2. Knockdown of Scribble, sGC-β1, or KifC2 or disrupting their associations prevents cGMP increase in dendrites and causes severe defects in apical dendrite development. Local cGMP elevation or sGC expression rescues the effects of Scribble knockdown on dendrite development, indicating that Scribble is an upstream regulator of cGMP. During neuronal polarization, dendrite development is directed by the Scribble scaffold that might link extracellular cues to localized cGMP increase."	0
"31932164"	"Structure and Mechanism of a Cyclic Trinucleotide-Activated Bacterial Endonuclease Mediating Bacteriophage Immunity.Bacteria possess an array of defenses against foreign invaders, including a broadly distributed bacteriophage defense system termed CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system). In CBASS systems, a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase synthesizes cyclic di- or tri-nucleotide second messengers in response to infection, and these molecules activate diverse effectors to mediate bacteriophage immunity via abortive infection. Here, we show that the CBASS effector NucC is related to restriction enzymes but uniquely assembles into a homotrimer. Binding of NucC trimers to a cyclic tri-adenylate second messenger promotes assembly of a NucC homohexamer competent for non-specific double-strand DNA cleavage. In infected cells, NucC activation leads to complete destruction of the bacterial chromosome, causing cell death prior to completion of phage replication. In addition to CBASS systems, we identify NucC homologs in over 30 type III CRISPR/Cas systems, where they likely function as accessory nucleases activated by cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers synthesized by these systems' effector complexes."	0
"32493775"	"Crystal structure of a conformational antibody that binds tau oligomers and inhibits pathological seeding by extracts from donors with Alzheimer's disease.Soluble oligomers of aggregated tau accompany the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils, a histological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and two dozen related neurodegenerative diseases. Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of <i>in vitro</i> tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies."	0

The small ∼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ∼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic."	0
"32647006"	"A kinase cascade on the yeast lysosomal vacuole regulates its membrane dynamics: conserved kinase Env7 is phosphorylated by casein kinase Yck3.Membrane fusion/fission is a highly dynamic and conserved process that responds to intra- and extracellular signals. Whereas the molecular machineries involved in membrane fusion/fission have been dissected, regulation of membrane dynamics remains poorly understood. The lysosomal vacuole of budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) has served as a seminal model in studies of membrane dynamics. We have previously established that yeast <i>ENV7</i> encodes an ortholog of STK16-related kinases that localizes to the vacuolar membrane and downregulates vacuolar membrane fusion. Additionally, we have previously reported that Env7 phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i> depends on <i>YCK3</i>, a gene that encodes a vacuolar membrane casein kinase I (CKI) homolog that nonredundantly functions in fusion regulation. Here, we report that Env7 physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by Yck3. We also establish that Env7 vacuole fusion/fission regulation and vacuolar localization are mediated through its Yck3-dependent phosphorylation. Through extensive site-directed mutagenesis, we map phosphorylation to the Env7 C terminus and confirm that Ser-331 is a primary and preferred phosphorylation site. Phospho-deficient Env7 mutants were defective in negative regulation of membrane fusion, increasing the number of prominent vacuoles, whereas a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-331 increased the number of fragmented vacuoles. Bioinformatics approaches confirmed that Env7 Ser-331 is within a motif that is highly conserved in STK16-related kinases and that it also anchors an SXXS CKI phosphorylation motif (<sub>328</sub>SRFS<sub>331</sub>). This study represents the first report on the regulatory mechanism of an STK16-related kinase. It also points to regulation of vacuolar membrane dynamics via a novel Yck3-Env7 kinase cascade."	1
"30595434"	"Noncanonical Modulation of the eIF2 Pathway Controls an Increase in Local Translation during Neural Wiring.Local translation is rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but its control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the extracellular cue Sema3A induces an initial burst in local translation that precisely controls phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α via the unfolded protein response (UPR) kinase PERK. Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers. Finally, we show that PERK signaling is needed for directional axon migration and visual pathway development in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a noncanonical eIF2 signaling pathway that controls selective changes in axon translation and is required for neural wiring."	1

While caspase-8 expression is lost in some tumors, it is increased in others, indicating a conditional pro-survival function of caspase-8 in cancer. Here, we show that tumor cells employ DNA-damage-induced nuclear caspase-8 to override the p53-dependent G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Caspase-8 is upregulated and localized to the nucleus in multiple human cancers, correlating with treatment resistance and poor clinical outcome. Depletion of caspase-8 causes G2/M arrest, stabilization of p53, and induction of p53-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in tumor cells. In the nucleus, caspase-8 cleaves and inactivates the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28), preventing USP28 from de-ubiquitinating and stabilizing wild-type p53. This results in de facto p53 protein loss, switching cell fate from apoptosis toward mitosis. In summary, our work identifies a non-canonical role of caspase-8 exploited by cancer cells to override the p53-dependent G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint."	1
"32783940"	"FOXK1 Participates in DNA Damage Response by Controlling 53BP1 Function.53BP1 plays a central role in dictating DNA repair choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), which is important for the sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) of BRCA1-deficient cancers. In this study, we show that FOXK1 associates with 53BP1 and regulates 53BP1-dependent functions. FOXK1-53BP1 interaction is significantly enhanced upon DNA damage during the S phase in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner, which reduces the association of 53BP1 with its downstream factors RIF1 and PTIP. Depletion of FOXK1 impairs DNA repair and induces compromised cell survival upon DNA damage. Overexpression of FOXK1 diminishes 53BP1 foci formation, which leads to resistance to PARPis and elevation of HR in BRCA1-deficient cells and decreased telomere fusion in TRF2-depleted cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that FOXK1 negatively regulates 53BP1 function by inhibiting 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, which alters the DSB-induced protein complexes centering on 53BP1 and thus influences DNA repair choice."	1
"32645369"	"RNF126-Mediated Reubiquitination Is Required for Proteasomal Degradation of p97-Extracted Membrane Proteins.Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is an AAA-ATPase that extracts polyubiquitinated substrates from multimeric macromolecular complexes and biological membranes for proteasomal degradation. During p97-mediated extraction, the substrate is largely deubiquitinated as it is threaded through the p97 central pore. How p97-extracted substrates are targeted to the proteasome with few or no ubiquitins is unknown. Here, we report that p97-extracted membrane proteins undergo a second round of ubiquitination catalyzed by the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase RNF126. RNF126 interacts with transmembrane-domain-specific chaperone BAG6, which captures p97-liberated substrates. RNF126 depletion in cells diminishes the ubiquitination of extracted membrane proteins, slows down their turnover, and dramatically stabilizes otherwise transient intermediates in the cytosol. We reconstitute the reubiquitination of a p97-extracted, misfolded multispanning membrane protein with purified factors. Our results demonstrate that p97-extracted substrates need to rapidly engage ubiquitin ligase-chaperone pairs that rebuild the ubiquitin signal for proteasome targeting to prevent harmful accumulation of unfolded intermediates."	1

This process is orchestrated by valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA+ ATPase that extracts polyubiquinated chromatin proteins and facilitates their turnover. However, because of the essential and pleiotropic effects of VCP in global proteostasis, it remains challenging practically to understand and target its DDR-specific functions. We describe a DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation event (Ser<sup>784</sup>), which selectively enhances chromatin-associated protein degradation mediated by VCP and is required for DNA repair, signaling, and cell survival. These functional effects of Ser<sup>784</sup> phosphorylation on DDR correlate with a decrease in VCP association with chromatin, cofactors NPL4/UFD1, and polyubiquitinated substrates. Clinically, high phospho-Ser<sup>784</sup>-VCP levels are significantly associated with poor outcome among chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients.

Although infection elicits neutralizing antibodies, these do not persist or cross-protect across multiple rhinovirus strains. To analyze rhinovirus-specific B cell responses in humans, we developed techniques using intact RV-A16 and RV-A39 for high-throughput high-dimensional single-cell analysis, with parallel assessment of antibody isotypes in an experimental infection model. Our approach identified T-bet+ B cells binding both viruses that account for ∼5% of CXCR5- memory B cells. These B cells infiltrate nasal tissue and expand in the blood after infection. Their rapid secretion of heterotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vitro, but not IgA, matches the nasal antibody profile post-infection. By contrast, CXCR5+ memory B cells binding a single virus are clonally distinct, absent in nasal tissue, and secrete homotypic IgG and IgA, mirroring the systemic response. Temporal and spatial functions of dichotomous memory B cells might explain the ability to resolve infection while rendering the host susceptible to re-infection."	0

Spt5 plays specific roles in the transcription of inflammation and stress-induced genes and tri-nucleotide expanded-repeat genes involved in inherited neurological pathologies. Here, we report the identification of Spt5-Pol II small-molecule inhibitors (SPIs). SPIs faithfully reproduced Spt5 knockdown effects on promoter-proximal pausing, NF-κB activation, and expanded-repeat huntingtin gene transcription. Using SPIs, we identified Spt5 target genes that responded with profoundly diverse kinetics. SPIs uncovered the regulatory role of Spt5 in metabolism via GDF15, a food intake- and body weight-inhibitory hormone. SPIs further unveiled a role for Spt5 in promoting the 3' end processing of histone genes. While several SPIs affect all Spt5 functions, a few inhibit a single one, implying uncoupling and selective targeting of Spt5 activities. SPIs expand the understanding of Spt5-Pol II functions and are potential drugs against metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases."	0
"31676231"	"Recognition of Histone Crotonylation by Taf14 Links Metabolic State to Gene Expression.Metabolic signaling to chromatin often underlies how adaptive transcriptional responses are controlled. While intermediary metabolites serve as co-factors for histone-modifying enzymes during metabolic flux, how these modifications contribute to transcriptional responses is poorly understood. Here, we utilize the highly synchronized yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) and find that fatty acid β-oxidation genes are periodically expressed coincident with the β-oxidation byproduct histone crotonylation. Specifically, we found that H3K9 crotonylation peaks when H3K9 acetylation declines and energy resources become limited. During this metabolic state, pro-growth gene expression is dampened; however, mutation of the Taf14 YEATS domain, a H3K9 crotonylation reader, results in de-repression of these genes. Conversely, exogenous addition of crotonic acid results in increased histone crotonylation, constitutive repression of pro-growth genes, and disrupted YMC oscillations. Together, our findings expose an unexpected link between metabolic flux and transcription and demonstrate that histone crotonylation and Taf14 participate in the repression of energy-demanding gene expression."	0
"32719006"	"Structural and functional studies of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> legumain beta reveal isoform specific mechanisms of activation and substrate recognition.The vacuolar cysteine protease legumain plays important functions in seed maturation and plant programmed cell death. Because of their dual protease and ligase activity, plant legumains have become of particular biotechnological interest, <i>e.g.</i> for the synthesis of cyclic peptides for drug design or for protein engineering. However, the molecular mechanisms behind their dual protease and ligase activities are still poorly understood, limiting their applications. Here, we present the crystal structure of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> legumain isoform β (AtLEGβ) in its zymogen state. Combining structural and biochemical experiments, we show for the first time that plant legumains encode distinct, isoform-specific activation mechanisms. Whereas the autocatalytic activation of isoform γ (AtLEGγ) is controlled by the latency-conferring dimer state, the activation of the monomeric AtLEGβ is concentration independent. Additionally, in AtLEGβ the plant-characteristic two-chain intermediate state is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions, as in AtLEGγ, resulting in significantly different pH stability profiles. The crystal structure of AtLEGβ revealed unrestricted nonprime substrate binding pockets, consistent with the broad substrate specificity, as determined by degradomic assays. Further to its protease activity, we show that AtLEGβ exhibits a true peptide ligase activity. Whereas cleavage-dependent transpeptidase activity has been reported for other plant legumains, AtLEGβ is the first example of a plant legumain capable of linking free termini. The discovery of these isoform-specific differences will allow us to identify and rationally design efficient ligases with application in biotechnology and drug development."	0

"32191872"	"Ago2-Dependent Processing Allows miR-451 to Evade the Global MicroRNA Turnover Elicited during Erythropoiesis.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are sequentially processed by two RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. miR-451 is the only known miRNA whose processing bypasses Dicer and instead relies on the slicer activity of Argonaute-2 (Ago2). miR-451 is highly conserved in vertebrates and regulates erythrocyte maturation, where it becomes the most abundant miRNA. However, the basis for the non-canonical biogenesis of miR-451 is unclear. Here, we show that Ago2 is less efficient than Dicer in processing pre-miRNAs, but this deficit is overcome when miR-144 represses Dicer in a negative-feedback loop during erythropoiesis. Loss of miR-144-mediated Dicer repression in zebrafish embryos and human cells leads to increased canonical miRNA production and impaired miR-451 maturation. Overexpression of Ago2 rescues some of the defects of miR-451 processing. Thus, the evolution of Ago2-dependent processing allows miR-451 to circumvent the global repression of canonical miRNAs elicited, in part, by the miR-144 targeting of Dicer during erythropoiesis."	1
"32433964"	"Generation and Profiling of 2,135 Human ESC Lines for the Systematic Analyses of Cell States Perturbed by Inducing Single Transcription Factors.Transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in determining cell states, yet our understanding of the causative relationship between TFs and cell states is limited. Here, we systematically examine the state changes of human pluripotent embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by the large-scale manipulation of single TFs. We establish 2,135 hESC lines, representing three clones each of 714 doxycycline (Dox)-inducible genes including 481 TFs, and obtain 26,998 microscopic cell images and 2,174 transcriptome datasets-RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarrays-48 h after the presence or absence of Dox. Interestingly, the expression of essentially all the genes, including genes located in heterochromatin regions, are perturbed by these TFs. TFs are also characterized by their ability to induce differentiation of hESCs into specific cell lineages. These analyses help to provide a way of classifying TFs and identifying specific sets of TFs for directing hESC differentiation into desired cell types."	0
"32442397"	"HLTF Promotes Fork Reversal, Limiting Replication Stress Resistance and Preventing Multiple Mechanisms of Unrestrained DNA Synthesis.DNA replication stress can stall replication forks, leading to genome instability. DNA damage tolerance pathways assist fork progression, promoting replication fork reversal, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and repriming. In the absence of the fork remodeler HLTF, forks fail to slow following replication stress, but underlying mechanisms and cellular consequences remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that HLTF-deficient cells fail to undergo fork reversal in vivo and rely on the primase-polymerase PRIMPOL for repriming, unrestrained replication, and S phase progression upon limiting nucleotide levels. By contrast, in an HLTF-HIRAN mutant, unrestrained replication relies on the TLS protein REV1. Importantly, HLTF-deficient cells also exhibit reduced double-strand break (DSB) formation and increased survival upon replication stress. Our findings suggest that HLTF promotes fork remodeling, preventing other mechanisms of replication stress tolerance in cancer cells. This remarkable plasticity of the replication fork may determine the outcome of replication stress in terms of genome integrity, tumorigenesis, and response to chemotherapy."	0
"30795892"	"Structural Basis for the Action of an All-Purpose Transcription Anti-termination Factor.Bacteriophage λN protein, a model anti-termination factor, binds nascent RNA and host Nus factors, rendering RNA polymerase resistant to all pause and termination signals. A 3.7-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure and structure-informed functional analyses reveal a multi-pronged strategy by which the intrinsically unstructured λN directly modifies RNA polymerase interactions with the nucleic acids and subverts essential functions of NusA, NusE, and NusG to reprogram the transcriptional apparatus. λN repositions NusA and remodels the β subunit flap tip, which likely precludes folding of pause or termination RNA hairpins in the exit tunnel and disrupts termination-supporting interactions of the α subunit C-terminal domains. λN invades and traverses the RNA polymerase hybrid cavity, likely stabilizing the hybrid and impeding pause- or termination-related conformational changes of polymerase. λN also lines upstream DNA, seemingly reinforcing anti-backtracking and anti-swiveling by NusG. Moreover, λN-repositioned NusA and NusE sequester the NusG C-terminal domain, counteracting ρ-dependent termination. Other anti-terminators likely utilize similar mechanisms to enable processive transcription."	0
"32035036"	"Dopamine Uses the DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A Signaling Axis to Block the TRAF6-Mediated NF-κB Pathway and Suppress Systemic Inflammation.The functional relevance and mechanistic basis of the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) on inflammation remain unclear. Here we reveal that DA inhibited TLR2-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation via the DRD5 receptor in macrophages. We found that the DRD5 receptor, via the EFD and IYX(X)I/L motifs in its CT and IC3 loop, respectively, can directly recruit TRAF6 and its negative regulator ARRB2 to form a multi-protein complex also containing downstream signaling proteins, such as TAK1, IKKs, and PP2A, that impairs TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-κB and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the DA-DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A signaling axis can prevent S. aureus-induced inflammation and protect mice against S. aureus-induced sepsis and meningitis after DA treatment. Collectively, these findings provide the first demonstration of DA-DRD5 signaling acting to control inflammation and a detailed delineation of the underlying mechanism and identify the DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A axis as a potential target for future therapy of inflammation-associated diseases such as meningitis and sepsis."	1
"32101745"	"Dense Transposon Integration Reveals Essential Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors Promote Heterochromatin Formation.Heterochromatin functions as a scaffold for factors responsible for gene silencing and chromosome segregation. Heterochromatin can be assembled by multiple pathways, including RNAi and RNA surveillance. We identified factors that form heterochromatin using dense profiles of transposable element integration in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The candidates include a large number of essential proteins such as four canonical mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors. We find that Iss1, a subunit of the poly(A) polymerase module, plays a role in forming heterochromatin in centromere repeats that is independent of RNAi. Genome-wide maps reveal that Iss1 accumulates at genes regulated by RNA surveillance. Iss1 interacts with RNA surveillance factors Mmi1 and Rrp6, and importantly, Iss1 contributes to RNA elimination that forms heterochromatin at meiosis genes. Our profile of transposable element integration supports the model that a network of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors coordinates RNA surveillance, including the mechanism that forms heterochromatin at meiotic genes."	0
"32139423"	"The adrenergic-induced ERK3 pathway drives lipolysis and suppresses energy dissipation.Obesity-induced diabetes affects >400 million people worldwide. Uncontrolled lipolysis (free fatty acid release from adipocytes) can contribute to diabetes and obesity. To identify future therapeutic avenues targeting this pathway, we performed a high-throughput screen and identified the extracellular-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) as a hit. We demonstrated that β-adrenergic stimulation stabilizes ERK3, leading to the formation of a complex with the cofactor MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), thereby driving lipolysis. Mechanistically, we identified a downstream target of the ERK3/MK5 pathway, the transcription factor FOXO1, which promotes the expression of the major lipolytic enzyme ATGL. Finally, we provide evidence that targeted deletion of ERK3 in mouse adipocytes inhibits lipolysis, but elevates energy dissipation, promoting lean phenotype and ameliorating diabetes. Thus, ERK3/MK5 represents a previously unrecognized signaling axis in adipose tissue and an attractive target for future therapies aiming to combat obesity-induced diabetes."	1
"32877671"	"Tp53 Suppression Promotes Cardiomyocyte Proliferation during Zebrafish Heart Regeneration.Zebrafish regenerate heart muscle through division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. To discover underlying regulation, we assess transcriptome datasets for dynamic gene networks during heart regeneration and identify suppression of genes associated with the transcription factor Tp53. Cardiac damage leads to fluctuation of Tp53 protein levels, concomitant with induced expression of its central negative regulator, mdm2, in regenerating cardiomyocytes. Zebrafish lacking functional Tp53 display increased indicators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration, whereas transgenic Mdm2 blockade inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Induced myocardial overexpression of the mitogenic factors Nrg1 or Vegfaa in the absence of injury also upregulates mdm2 and suppresses Tp53 levels, and tp53 mutations augment the mitogenic effects of Nrg1. mdm2 induction is spatiotemporally associated with markers of de-differentiation in injury and growth contexts, suggesting a broad role in cardiogenesis. Our findings reveal myocardial Tp53 suppression by mitogen-induced Mdm2 as a regulatory component of innate cardiac regeneration."	1
"32937140"	"Endogenous Cyclin D1 Promotes the Rate of Onset and Magnitude of Mitogenic Signaling via Akt1 Ser473 Phosphorylation.Cyclin D1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates RB and functions as a collaborative nuclear oncogene. The serine threonine kinase Akt plays a pivotal role in the control of cellular metabolism, survival, and mitogenic signaling. Herein, Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates in the mammary gland is reduced by cyclin D1 genetic deletion and is induced by mammary-gland-targeted cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 is associated with Akt1 and augments the rate of onset and maximal cellular Akt1 activity induced by mitogens. Cyclin D1 is identified in a cytoplasmic-membrane-associated pool, and cytoplasmic-membrane-localized cyclin D1-but not nuclear-localized cyclin D1-recapitulates Akt1 transcriptional function. These studies identify a novel extranuclear function of cyclin D1 to enhance proliferative functions via augmenting Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473."	1

"31940494"	"Mouse Ovarian Cancer Models Recapitulate the Human Tumor Microenvironment and Patient Response to Treatment.Although there are many prospective targets in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), pre-clinical testing is challenging, especially as there is limited information on the murine TME. Here, we characterize the TME of six orthotopic, transplantable syngeneic murine HGSOC lines established from genetic models and compare these to patient biopsies. We identify significant correlations between the transcriptome, host cell infiltrates, matrisome, vasculature, and tissue modulus of mouse and human TMEs, with several stromal and malignant targets in common. However, each model shows distinct differences and potential vulnerabilities that enabled us to test predictions about response to chemotherapy and an anti-IL-6 antibody. Using machine learning, the transcriptional profiles of the mouse tumors that differed in chemotherapy response are able to classify chemotherapy-sensitive and -refractory patient tumors. These models provide useful pre-clinical tools and may help identify subgroups of HGSOC patients who are most likely to respond to specific therapies."	0
