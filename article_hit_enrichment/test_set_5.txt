"32814047"	"Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2S Enhances Viral Replication by Inhibiting Type I IFN Production through Recruiting USP15 to Deubiquitinate TBK1.Type I interferon (IFN) plays an essential role in the host innate immune responses. Several ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) family members were reported to regulate type I IFN production and host antiviral immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we report that UBE2S acts as a negative regulator in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of UBE2S inhibits host antiviral immune responses and enhances viral replications, whereas deficiency of UBE2S enhances host antiviral immune responses and suppresses viral replications both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of type І IFN production by UBE2S is independent on its E2 and E3 enzymic activity. Mechanistically, UBE2S interacts with TBK1 and recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) to remove Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains of TBK1. Our findings reveal a role of the UBE2S-USP15-TBK1 axis in the regulation of host antiviral innate immune responses."	1
"30472190"	"Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft.Transcription initiation requires opening of promoter DNA in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC), but it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast PIC that contains underwound, distorted promoter DNA in the closed Pol II cleft. The DNA duplex axis is offset at the upstream edge of the initially melted DNA region (IMR) where DNA opening begins. Unstable IMRs are found in a subset of yeast promoters that we show can still initiate transcription after depletion of the transcription factor (TF) IIH (TFIIH) translocase Ssl2 (XPB in human) from the nucleus in vivo. PIC-induced DNA distortions may thus prime the IMR for melting and may explain how unstable IMRs that are predicted in promoters of Pol I and Pol III can open spontaneously. These results suggest that DNA distortion in the polymerase cleft is a general mechanism that contributes to promoter opening."	0

"31542296"	"Rad52 Restrains Resection at DNA Double-Strand Break Ends in Yeast.Rad52 is a key factor for homologous recombination (HR) in yeast. Rad52 helps assemble Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments that catalyze DNA strand exchange, and it mediates single-strand DNA annealing. We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from ∼3-5 kb/h up to ∼10-20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA. These results identify a role for Rad52 in limiting ssDNA generated by end resection."	1
"30878283"	"Co-translational, Post-translational, and Non-catalytic Roles of N-Terminal Acetyltransferases.Recent studies of N-terminal acetylation have identified new N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and expanded the known functions of these enzymes beyond their roles as ribosome-associated co-translational modifiers. For instance, the identification of Golgi- and chloroplast-associated NATs shows that acetylation of N termini also happens post-translationally. In addition, we now appreciate that some NATs are highly specific; for example, a dedicated NAT responsible for post-translational N-terminal acetylation of actin was recently revealed. Other studies have extended NAT function beyond Nt acetylation, including functions as lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and non-catalytic roles. Finally, emerging studies emphasize the physiological relevance of N-terminal acetylation, including roles in calorie-restriction-induced longevity and pathological α-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Combined, the NATs rise as multifunctional proteins, and N-terminal acetylation is gaining recognition as a major cellular regulator."	0
"31492635"	"PTEN Suppresses Glycolysis by Dephosphorylating and Inhibiting Autophosphorylated PGK1.The PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently mutated or deleted in cancer and regulates glucose metabolism through the PI3K-AKT pathway. However, whether PTEN directly regulates glycolysis in tumor cells is unclear. We demonstrate here that PTEN directly interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1). PGK1 functions not only as a glycolytic enzyme but also as a protein kinase intermolecularly autophosphorylating itself at Y324 for activation. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN dephosphorylates and inhibits autophosphorylated PGK1, thereby inhibiting glycolysis, ATP production, and brain tumor cell proliferation. In addition, knockin expression of a PGK1 Y324F mutant inhibits brain tumor formation. Analyses of human glioblastoma specimens reveals that PGK1 Y324 phosphorylation levels inversely correlate with PTEN expression status and are positively associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. This work highlights the instrumental role of PGK1 autophosphorylation in its activation and PTEN protein phosphatase activity in governing glycolysis and tumorigenesis."	1
"31940493"	"FOXD3 Regulates VISTA Expression in Melanoma.Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved patient survival in melanoma, but the innate resistance of many patients necessitates the investigation of alternative immune targets. Many immune checkpoint proteins lack proper characterization, including V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA). VISTA expression on immune cells can suppress T cell activity; however, few studies have investigated its expression and regulation in cancer cells. In this study, we observe that VISTA is expressed in melanoma patient samples and cell lines. Tumor cell-specific expression of VISTA promotes tumor onset in vivo, associated with increased intratumoral T regulatory cells, and enhanced PDL-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating macrophages. VISTA transcript levels are regulated by the stemness factor Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3). BRAF inhibition upregulates FOXD3 and reduces VISTA expression. Overall, this study demonstrates melanoma cell expression of VISTA and its regulation by FOXD3, contributing to the rationale for therapeutic strategies that combine targeted inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade."	1

During cold, a PHD-PRC2 complex metastably and digitally nucleates H3K27me3 within <i>FLC</i> On return to warm, PHD-PRC2 spreads across the locus delivering H3K27me3 to maintain long-term silencing. Here, we studied natural variation in this process in <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions, exploring Lov-1, which shows <i>FLC</i> reactivation on return to warm, a feature characteristic of <i>FLC</i> in perennial <i>Brassicaceae</i> This analysis identifies an additional phase in this Polycomb silencing mechanism downstream from H3K27me3 spreading. In this long-term silencing (perpetuated) phase, the PHD proteins are lost from the nucleation region and silencing is likely maintained by the read-write feedbacks associated with H3K27me3. A combination of noncoding SNPs in the nucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 <i>FLC</i> frequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing cold duration. We propose that this decrease in reactivation probability is due to reduced DNA replication after flowering. Overall, this work defines an additional phase in the Polycomb mechanism instrumental in natural variation of silencing, and provides avenues to dissect broader evolutionary changes at <i>FLC</i>."	0
"32755575"	"Immune Monitoring Reveals Fusion Peptide Priming to Imprint Cross-Clade HIV-Neutralizing Responses with a Characteristic Early B Cell Signature.The HIV fusion peptide (FP) is a promising vaccine target. FP-directed monoclonal antibodies from vaccinated macaques have been identified that neutralize up to ∼60% of HIV strains; these vaccinations, however, have involved ∼1 year with an extended neutralization-eclipse phase without measurable serum neutralization. Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth ∼1 year later. Immune monitoring of B cells in response to vaccination can thus enable vaccine insights even in the absence of serum neutralization, here identifying FP imprinting, cocktail approach, and early signature as means to improve FP-directed vaccine responses."	0
"32620552"	"Phosphorylation on Ser-359 of the α2 subunit in GABA type A receptors down-regulates their density at inhibitory synapses.GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) mediate fast synaptic inhibition and are trafficked to functionally diverse synapses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition. The MS data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange, with the data set identifier PXD019597."	1
"32023449"	"Human Fc Receptor-like 3 Inhibits Regulatory T Cell Function and Binds Secretory IgA.Human Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3) is an orphan receptor expressed by lymphocytes, including regulatory T cells. FCRL3 is implicated in several autoimmune diseases; however, its function on regulatory T cells is unknown. We discovered that FCRL3 stimulation of regulatory T cells inhibited their suppressive function. Moreover, FCRL3 stimulation induced IL-17, IL-26, and IFNγ production and promoted expression of the Th17-defining transcription factor RORγt without affecting FOXP3 expression. We suggest that FCRL3 engagement mediates a transition of regulatory T cells to a pro-inflammatory Th17-like phenotype. In addition, we identified secretory IgA as a specific FCRL3 ligand. Secretory IgA could serve as an environmental cue for mucosal breaches and locally drive regulatory T cell plasticity to help control infection. Our findings define a mechanism that explains the recognized association of FCRL3 with autoimmune diseases. Targeting FCRL3 to modulate regulatory T cell activity could be exploited to treat both malignancies and autoimmune diseases."	0
"30898438"	"MDC1 Interacts with TOPBP1 to Maintain Chromosomal Stability during Mitosis.In mitosis, cells inactivate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to preserve genome stability. However, some early signaling events still occur, such as recruitment of the scaffold protein MDC1 to phosphorylated histone H2AX at DSBs. Yet, it remains unclear whether these events are important for maintaining genome stability during mitosis. Here, we identify a highly conserved protein-interaction surface in MDC1 that is phosphorylated by CK2 and recognized by the DNA-damage response mediator protein TOPBP1. Disruption of MDC1-TOPBP1 binding causes a specific loss of TOPBP1 recruitment to DSBs in mitotic but not interphase cells, accompanied by mitotic radiosensitivity, increased micronuclei, and chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, we find that TOPBP1 forms filamentous structures capable of bridging MDC1 foci in mitosis, indicating that MDC1-TOPBP1 complexes tether DSBs until repair is reactivated in the following G1 phase. Thus, we reveal an important, hitherto-unnoticed cooperation between MDC1 and TOPBP1 in maintaining genome stability during cell division."	1
"32268105"	"Integration of Nodal and BMP Signaling by Mutual Signaling Effector Antagonism.Opposing sources of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Nodal signaling molecules are sufficient to induce the formation of a full axis in zebrafish embryos. To address how these signals orchestrate patterning, we transplant sources of fluorescently tagged Nodal and BMP into zebrafish embryos, robustly inducing the formation of secondary axes. Nodal and BMP signal non-cell-autonomously and form similar protein gradients in this context, but the signaling range of Nodal (pSmad2) is shorter than the BMP range (pSmad5). This yields a localized region of pSmad2 activity around the Nodal source, overlapping with a broad domain of pSmad5 activity across the embryo. Cell fates induced in various regions stereotypically correlate with pSmad2-to-pSmad5 ratios and can even be induced BMP- and Nodal-independently with different ratios of constitutively active Smad2 and Smad5. Strikingly, we find that Smad2 and Smad5 antagonize each other for specific cell fates, providing a mechanism for how cells integrate and discriminate between overlapping signals during development."	0
"32579936"	"mTOR Overcomes Multiple Metabolic Restrictions to Enable HIV-1 Reverse Transcription and Intracellular Transport.Cellular metabolism governs the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV-1 infection. Multiple early post-fusion steps of HIV-1 replication are restricted in resting peripheral blood CD4 T cells; however, molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic control of these steps remain undefined. Here, we show that mTOR activity following T cell stimulatory signals overcomes metabolic restrictions in these cells by enabling the expansion of dNTPs to fuel HIV-1 reverse transcription (RT), as well as increasing acetyl-CoA to stabilize microtubules that transport RT products. We find that catalytic mTOR inhibition diminishes the expansion of pools of both of these metabolites by limiting glucose and glutamine utilization in several pathways, thereby suppressing HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate how mTOR-coordinated biosyntheses enable the early steps of HIV-1 replication, add metabolic mechanisms by which mTOR inhibitors block HIV-1, and identify some metabolic modules downstream of mTOR as druggable targets for HIV-1 inhibition."	0
"32160552"	"Layer 6b Is Driven by Intracortical Long-Range Projection Neurons.Layer 6b (L6b), the deepest neocortical layer, projects to cortical targets and higher-order thalamus and is the only layer responsive to the wake-promoting neuropeptide orexin/hypocretin. These characteristics suggest that L6b can strongly modulate brain state, but projections to L6b and their influence remain unknown. Here, we examine the inputs to L6b ex vivo in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex with rabies-based retrograde tracing and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices. We find that L6b receives its strongest excitatory input from intracortical long-range projection neurons, including those in the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, local intracortical input and thalamocortical input were significantly weaker. Moreover, our data suggest that L6b receives far less thalamocortical input than other cortical layers. L6b was most strongly inhibited by PV and SST interneurons. This study shows that L6b integrates long-range intracortical information and is not part of the traditional thalamocortical loop."	0
"31981475"	"The G3BP1-Family-USP10 Deubiquitinase Complex Rescues Ubiquitinated 40S Subunits of Ribosomes Stalled in Translation from Lysosomal Degradation.Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) purges aberrant mRNAs and nascent polypeptides in a multi-step molecular process initiated by the E3 ligase ZNF598 through sensing of ribosomes collided at aberrant mRNAs and monoubiquitination of distinct small ribosomal subunit proteins. We show that G3BP1-family-USP10 complexes are required for deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3, and RPS10 to rescue modified 40S subunits from programmed degradation. Knockout of USP10 or G3BP1 family proteins increased lysosomal ribosomal degradation and perturbed ribosomal subunit stoichiometry, both of which were rescued by a single K214R substitution of RPS3. While the majority of RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination resulted from ZNF598-dependent sensing of ribosome collisions initiating RQC, another minor pathway contributed to their monoubiquitination. G3BP1 family proteins have long been considered RNA-binding proteins, however, our results identified 40S subunits and associated mRNAs as their predominant targets, a feature shared by stress granules to which G3BP1 family proteins localize under stress."	1
"32284542"	"Loss of ELF5-FBXW7 stabilizes IFNGR1 to promote the growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer through interferon-γ signalling.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a high degree of immune infiltrate in the tumour microenvironment, which may influence the fate of TNBC cells. We reveal that loss of the tumour suppressive transcription factor Elf5 in TNBC cells activates intrinsic interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signalling, promoting tumour progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, we find that loss of the Elf5-regulated ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 ensures stabilization of its putative protein substrate IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) at the protein level in TNBC. Elf5<sup>low</sup> tumours show enhanced IFN-γ signalling accompanied by an increase of immunosuppressive neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment and increased programmed death ligand 1 expression. Inactivation of either programmed death ligand 1 or IFNGR1 elicited a robust anti-tumour and/or anti-metastatic effect. A positive correlation between ELF5 and FBXW7 expression and a negative correlation between ELF5, FBXW7 and IFNGR1 expression in the tumours of patients with TNBC strongly suggest that this signalling axis could be exploited for patient stratification and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for Elf5<sup>low</sup> patients with TNBC."	0
"32640217"	"Extracellular Granzyme A Promotes Colorectal Cancer Development by Enhancing Gut Inflammation.If not properly regulated, the inflammatory immune response can promote carcinogenesis, as evident in colorectal cancer (CRC). Aiming to gain mechanistic insight into the link between inflammation and CRC, we perform transcriptomics analysis of human CRC, identifying a strong correlation between expression of the serine protease granzyme A (GzmA) and inflammation. In a dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) mouse model, deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of extracellular GzmA both attenuate gut inflammation and prevent CRC development, including the initial steps of cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, extracellular GzmA induces NF-κB-dependent IL-6 production in macrophages, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation in cultured CRC cells. Accordingly, colon tissues from DSS/AOM-treated, GzmA-deficient animals present reduced levels of pSTAT3. By identifying GzmA as a proinflammatory protease that promotes CRC development, these findings provide information on mechanisms that link immune cell infiltration to cancer progression and present GzmA as a therapeutic target for CRC."	1
"31521505"	"PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 Synergize to Coordinate H3K27 Trimethylation.Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is composed of EED, SUZ12, and EZH1/2 and mediates mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. At least two independent subcomplexes exist, defined by their specific accessory proteins: PRC2.1 (PCL1-3, EPOP, and PALI1/2) and PRC2.2 (AEBP2 and JARID2). We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1-3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms."	0
"31919193"	"A single-cell atlas of the developing <i>Drosophila</i> ovary identifies follicle stem cell progenitors.Addressing the complexity of organogenesis at a system-wide level requires a complete understanding of adult cell types, their origin, and precursor relationships. The <i>Drosophila</i> ovary has been a model to study how coordinated stem cell units, germline, and somatic follicle stem cells maintain and renew an organ. However, lack of cell type-specific tools have limited our ability to study the origin of individual cell types and stem cell units. Here, we used a single-cell RNA sequencing approach to uncover all known cell types of the developing ovary, reveal transcriptional signatures, and identify cell type-specific markers for lineage tracing. Our study identifies a novel cell type corresponding to the elusive follicle stem cell precursors and predicts subtypes of known cell types. Altogether, we reveal a previously unanticipated complexity of the developing ovary and provide a comprehensive resource for the systematic analysis of ovary morphogenesis."	0
"32424275"	"Enhancer reprogramming driven by high-order assemblies of transcription factors promotes phenotypic plasticity and breast cancer endocrine resistance.Acquired therapy resistance is a major problem for anticancer treatment, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using an established breast cancer cellular model, we show that endocrine resistance is associated with enhanced phenotypic plasticity, indicated by a general downregulation of luminal/epithelial differentiation markers and upregulation of basal/mesenchymal invasive markers. Consistently, similar gene expression changes are found in clinical breast tumours and patient-derived xenograft samples that are resistant to endocrine therapies. Mechanistically, the differential interactions between oestrogen receptor α and other oncogenic transcription factors, exemplified by GATA3 and AP1, drive global enhancer gain/loss reprogramming, profoundly altering breast cancer transcriptional programs. Our functional studies in multiple culture and xenograft models reveal a coordinated role of GATA3 and AP1 in re-organizing enhancer landscapes and regulating cancer phenotypes. Collectively, our study suggests that differential high-order assemblies of transcription factors on enhancers trigger genome-wide enhancer reprogramming, resulting in transcriptional transitions that promote tumour phenotypic plasticity and therapy resistance."	0
"32521269"	"The Protein Arginine Methyltransferase PRMT8 and Substrate G3BP1 Control Rac1-PAK1 Signaling and Actin Cytoskeleton for Dendritic Spine Maturation.Excitatory synapses of neurons are located on dendritic spines. Spine maturation is essential for the stability of synapses and memory consolidation, and overproduction of the immature filopodia is associated with brain disorders. The structure and function of synapses can be modulated by protein post-translational modification (PTM). Arginine methylation is a major PTM that regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and splicing within the nucleus. Here we find that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 is present at neuronal synapses and its expression is upregulated in the hippocampus when dendritic spine maturation occurs. Depletion of PRMT8 leads to overabundance of filopodia and mis-localization of excitatory synapses. Mechanistically, PRMT8 promotes dendritic spine morphology through methylation of the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1 and suppression of the Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway to control synaptic actin dynamics. Our findings unravel arginine methylation as a crucial regulatory mechanism for actin cytoskeleton during synapse development."	1

Here, we perform a combined transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of midbrain cells after LXR activation, followed by bioinformatic analysis to elucidate the transcriptional networks controlling mDA neurogenesis. Our results identify the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) as part of a cluster of proneural transcription factors in radial glia and as a regulator of transcription factors controlling mDA neurogenesis, such as Foxa2. Moreover, loss- and gain-of-function experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that Srebf1 is both required and sufficient for mDA neurogenesis. Our data, thus, identify Srebf1 as a central player in mDA neurogenesis."	1
"31973889"	"PIKES Analysis Reveals Response to Degraders and Key Regulatory Mechanisms of the CRL4 Network.Co-opting Cullin4 RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s) to inducibly degrade pathogenic proteins is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. Despite intense efforts to rationally design degrader molecules that co-opt CRL4s, much about the organization and regulation of these ligases remains elusive. Here, we establish protein interaction kinetics and estimation of stoichiometries (PIKES) analysis, a systematic proteomic profiling platform that integrates cellular engineering, affinity purification, chemical stabilization, and quantitative mass spectrometry to investigate the dynamics of interchangeable multiprotein complexes. Using PIKES, we show that ligase assemblies of Cullin4 with individual substrate receptors differ in abundance by up to 200-fold and that Cand1/2 act as substrate receptor exchange factors. Furthermore, degrader molecules can induce the assembly of their cognate CRL4, and higher expression of the associated substrate receptor enhances degrader potency. Beyond the CRL4 network, we show how PIKES can reveal systems level biochemistry for cellular protein networks important to drug development."	0
"31398325"	"Landscape of Intercellular Crosstalk in Healthy and NASH Liver Revealed by Single-Cell Secretome Gene Analysis.Cell-cell communication via ligand-receptor signaling is a fundamental feature of complex organs. Despite this, the global landscape of intercellular signaling in mammalian liver has not been elucidated. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on non-parenchymal cells isolated from healthy and NASH mouse livers. Secretome gene analysis revealed a highly connected network of intrahepatic signaling and disruption of vascular signaling in NASH. We uncovered the emergence of NASH-associated macrophages (NAMs), which are marked by high expression of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), as a feature of mouse and human NASH that is linked to disease severity and highly responsive to pharmacological and dietary interventions. Finally, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) serve as a hub of intrahepatic signaling via HSC-derived stellakines and their responsiveness to vasoactive hormones.

"31474573"	"Polyamines Control eIF5A Hypusination, TFEB Translation, and Autophagy to Reverse B Cell Senescence.Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans."	1

Cell culture systems for prion propagation have greatly advanced molecular insights into prion biology, but translation of <i>in vitro</i> to <i>in vivo</i> findings is often disappointing. A wider range of cell culture systems might help overcome these shortcomings. Here, we describe an immortalized mouse neuronal astrocyte cell line (C8D1A) that can be infected with murine prions. Both PrP<sup>C</sup> protein and mRNA levels in astrocytes were comparable with those in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines permitting persistent prion infection. We challenged astrocytes with three mouse-adapted prion strains (22L, RML, and ME7) and cultured them for six passages. Immunoblotting results revealed that the astrocytes propagated 22L prions well over all six passages, whereas ME7 prions did not replicate, and RML prions replicated only very weakly after five passages. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated similar results for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> Interestingly, when we used prion conversion activity as a readout in real-time quaking-induced conversion assays with RML-infected cell lysates, we observed a strong signal over all six passages, comparable with that for 22L-infected cells. These data indicate that the C8D1A cell line is permissive to prion infection. Moreover, the propagated prions differed in conversion and proteinase K-resistance levels in these astrocytes. We propose that the C8D1A cell line could be used to decipher prion strain biology."	0
"32846118"	"Antagonistic Interaction between Auxin and SA Signaling Pathways Regulates Bacterial Infection through Lateral Root in Arabidopsis.Pathogen entry into host tissues is a critical and first step in infections. In plants, the lateral roots (LRs) are a potential entry and colonization site for pathogens. Here, using a GFP-labeled pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pto DC3000), we observe that virulent Pto DC3000 invades plants through emerged LRs in Arabidopsis. Pto DC3000 strongly induced LR formation, a process that was dependent on the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19-LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN (LBD) regulatory module. We show that salicylic acid (SA) represses LR formation, and several mutants defective in SA signaling are also involved in Pto DC3000-induced LR development. Significantly, ARF7, a well-documented positive regulator of LR development, directly represses the transcription of PR1 and PR2 to promote LR development. This study indicates that ARF7-mediated auxin signaling antagonizes with SA signaling to control bacterial infection through the regulation of LR development."	1
"31442426"	"Proximity RNA Labeling by APEX-Seq Reveals the Organization of Translation Initiation Complexes and Repressive RNA Granules.Diverse ribonucleoprotein complexes control mRNA processing, translation, and decay. Transcripts in these complexes localize to specific regions of the cell and can condense into non-membrane-bound structures such as stress granules. It has proven challenging to map the RNA composition of these large and dynamic structures, however. We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq, which uses the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to probe the spatial organization of the transcriptome. We show that APEX-seq can resolve the localization of RNAs within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key RNA-binding proteins. Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-seq, with the spatial proteome determined by APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS), obtained precisely in parallel, provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs and unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition. Our novel technique allows a powerful and general approach to explore the spatial environment of macromolecules."	0
"31968249"	"The Mitochondrial Protein MAVS Stabilizes p53 to Suppress Tumorigenesis.Recent reports have shown the critical role of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein in virus-induced apoptosis, but the involvement of MAVS in tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Herein, we report that MAVS is a key regulator of p53 activation and is critical for protecting against tumorigenesis. We find that MAVS promotes p53-dependent cell death in response to DNA damage. MAVS interacts with p53 and mediates p53 mitochondrial recruitment under genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, MAVS inhibits p53 ubiquitination by blocking the formation of the p53-murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) complex, leading to the stabilization of p53. Notably, compared with their wild-type littermates, MAVS knockout mice display decreased resistance to azoxymethane (AOM) or AOM/dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced colon cancer.

We investigated the function of the long BIRC3 3' UTR, which is upregulated in leukemia. The 3' UTR does not regulate BIRC3 protein localization or abundance but is required for CXCR4-mediated B cell migration. We established an experimental pipeline to study the mechanism of regulation and used mass spectrometry to identify BIRC3 protein interactors. In addition to 3'-UTR-independent interactors involved in known BIRC3 functions, we detected interactors that bind only to BIRC3 protein encoded from the mRNA with the long 3' UTR. They regulate several functions, including CXCR4 trafficking. We further identified RNA-binding proteins differentially bound to the alternative 3' UTRs and found that cooperative binding of Staufen and HuR mediates 3'-UTR-dependent complex formation. We show that the long 3' UTR is required for the formation of specific protein complexes that enable additional functions of BIRC3 protein beyond its 3'-UTR-independent functions."	0
"32294449"	"Cell Metabolic Alterations due to Mcph1 Mutation in Microcephaly.A distinctive feature of neocortical development is the highly coordinated production of different progenitor cell subtypes, which are critical for ensuring adequate neurogenic outcome and the development of normal neocortical size. To further understand the mechanisms that underlie neocortical growth, we focused our studies on the microcephaly gene Mcph1, and we report here that Mcph1 (1) exerts its functions in rapidly dividing apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) during mouse neocortical development stages that precede indirect neurogenesis; (2) is expressed at mitochondria; and (3) controls the proper proliferation and survival of RGCs, potentially through crosstalk with cellular metabolic pathways involving the stimulation of mitochondrial activity via VDAC1/GRP75 and AKT/HK2/VDAC1 and glutaminolysis via ATF4/PCK2. We currently report the description of a MCPH-gene implication in the interplay between bioenergetic pathways and neocortical growth, thus pointing to alterations of cellular metabolic pathways, in particular glutaminolysis, as a possible cause of microcephalic pathogenesis."	1
"30853402"	"The Cargo Receptor NDP52 Initiates Selective Autophagy by Recruiting the ULK Complex to Cytosol-Invading Bacteria.Xenophagy, a selective autophagy pathway that protects the cytosol against bacterial invasion, relies on cargo receptors that juxtapose bacteria and phagophore membranes. Whether phagophores are recruited from a constitutive pool or are generated de novo at prospective cargo remains unknown. Phagophore formation in situ would require recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery to prospective cargo. Here, we show that, essential for anti-bacterial autophagy, the cargo receptor NDP52 forms a trimeric complex with FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1, which are subunits of the autophagy-initiating ULK and the TBK1 kinase complex, respectively. FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1 are each recruited independently to bacteria via NDP52, as revealed by selective point mutations in their respective binding sites, but only in their combined presence does xenophagy proceed. Such recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery by NDP52 reveals how detection of cargo-associated ""eat me"" signals, induction of autophagy, and juxtaposition of cargo and phagophores are integrated in higher eukaryotes."	1
"32610043"	"Critical Role of Type III Interferon in Controlling SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells.Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and production of infectious de novo virus particles. We found that viral infection elicits an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where interferon-mediated responses are efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo virus production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and fueling an exacerbated cytokine response."	0
"32755583"	"Macrophage K63-Linked Ubiquitination of YAP Promotes Its Nuclear Localization and Exacerbates Atherosclerosis.The Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway has pivotal roles in innate immune responses against pathogens in macrophages. However, the role of YAP in macrophages during atherosclerosis and its mechanism of YAP activation remain unknown. Here, we find that YAP overexpression in myeloid cells aggravates atherosclerotic lesion size and infiltration of macrophages, whereas YAP deficiency reduces atherosclerotic plaque. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a downstream effector of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), triggers YAP ubiquitination at K252, which interrupts the interaction between YAP and angiomotin and results in enhanced YAP nuclear translocation. The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra reduces atherosclerotic lesion formation, which is abrogated by YAP overexpression. YAP level is increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic vessels, and plasma IL-1β level in patients with STEMI is correlated with YAP protein level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These findings elucidate a mechanism of YAP activation, which might be a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis."	0

Here, we show that mammalian ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) is a previously unrecognized component of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) receptor 1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) and attenuates TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling. Genetic ablation of MST1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages potentiated the TNFα-induced increase in IκB kinase (IKK) activity, as well as the expression of NF-κB target genes. TNFα induced the recruitment of MST1 to TNF-RSC and its interaction with HOIP, the catalytic component of the E3 ligase linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC). Furthermore, MST1 activated in response to TNFα stimulation mediates the phosphorylation of HOIP and thereby inhibited LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ. Together, our findings suggest that MST1 negatively regulates TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling by targeting LUBAC."	1
"31919192"	"Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 degradation regulates kinetochore composition in meiosis.The kinetochore complex is a conserved machinery that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules. During meiosis, the kinetochore is restructured to accommodate a specialized chromosome segregation pattern. In budding yeast, meiotic kinetochore remodeling is mediated by the temporal changes in the abundance of a single subunit called Ndc80. We previously described the regulatory events that control the timely synthesis of Ndc80. Here, we report that Ndc80 turnover is also tightly regulated in meiosis: Ndc80 degradation is active in meiotic prophase, but not in metaphase I. Ndc80 degradation depends on the ubiquitin ligase APC<sup>Ama1</sup> and is mediated by the proteasome. Importantly, Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation, a mark that has been previously implicated in correcting erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, is essential for Ndc80 degradation in a microtubule-independent manner. The N terminus of Ndc80, including a 27-residue sequence and Aurora B phosphorylation sites, is both necessary and sufficient for kinetochore protein degradation. Finally, defects in Ndc80 turnover predispose meiotic cells to chromosome mis-segregation. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which meiotic cells modulate their kinetochore composition through regulated Ndc80 degradation, and demonstrates that Aurora B-dependent regulation of kinetochores extends beyond altering microtubule attachments."	1
"32101753"	"Auto-ubiquitination of NEDD4-1 Recruits USP13 to Facilitate Autophagy through Deubiquitinating VPS34.The class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) is a core protein of autophagy initiation, yet the regulatory mechanisms responsible for its stringent control remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1 promotes the autophagy flux by targeting VPS34. NEDD4-1 undergoes lysine 29 (K29)-linked auto-ubiquitination at K1279 and serves as a scaffold for recruiting the ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) to form an NEDD4-1-USP13 deubiquitination complex, which subsequently stabilizes VPS34 to promote autophagy through removing the K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from VPS34 at K419. Knockout of either NEDD4-1 or USP13 increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of VPS34, thus attenuating the formation of the autophagosome. Our results identify an essential role for NEDD4-1 in regulating autophagy, which provides molecular insights into the mechanisms by which ubiquitination regulates autophagy flux."	1

However, molecular integration of developmental signaling with MSC-intrinsic chromatin regulation remains incompletely understood. SWI/SNF-(BAF) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler implicated in multi-cellular development. We show that BMPs and long-term osteogenic signals in MSCs selectively induce expression of polybromo BAF (PBAF) components Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7. Loss of Pbrm1/Arid2/Brd7 profoundly impairs osteolineage gene expression and osteogenesis without compromising adipogenesis. Pbrm1 loss attenuates MSC in vivo ossification. Mechanistically, Pbrm1/PBAF deficiency impairs Smad1/5/8 activation through locus-specific epi-genomic remodeling, involving Pbrm1 bromodomains, along with transcriptional downregulation of Bmpr/TgfβrII affecting BMP-early-responsive gene expression. Gain of function of BmprIβ, TgfβrII in PBAF-deficient MSCs partly restores Smad1/5/8 activation and osteogenesis. Pbrm1 loss further affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor activity through non-cell-autonomous regulation of microenvironment and niche-factor expression. Together, these findings reveal a link illustrating epi-genomic feedforward control of BMP/TGF-β signaling to transcriptional and cellular plasticity in the mesenchymal microenvironment and account for stromal-SWI/SNF in hematopoiesis."	1
"32755570"	"The MARCH6-SQLE Axis Controls Endothelial Cholesterol Homeostasis and Angiogenic Sprouting.The endothelial monolayer forms a barrier between the lumen of blood vessels and the underlying tissues. Stable VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions are essential for maintaining this barrier, whereas their remodeling is required for angiogenesis in health and disease. Here, we position the ERAD-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a determinant of angiogenic sprouting and barrier integrity through its ability to promote the degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Accordingly, MARCHF6 ablation in endothelial cells increases SQLE protein and cholesterol load. This leads to altered membrane order, disorganized adherens junctions, decreased endothelial barrier function, and impaired SQLE-dependent sprouting angiogenesis. Akin to MARCHF6 silencing, the overexpression of SQLE impairs angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is also attenuated when SQLE is silenced, indicating that fine-tuning cholesterol biosynthesis is a determinant of healthy endothelial function. In summary, we propose a mechanistic link between regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by the MARCH6-SQLE axis and endothelial integrity and angiogenesis."	1
"32905770"	"Metabolic Control of Gametophore Shoot Formation through Arginine in the Moss Physcomitrium patens.Shoot formation is accompanied by active cell proliferation and expansion, requiring that metabolic state adapts to developmental control. Despite the importance of such metabolic reprogramming, it remains unclear how development and metabolism are integrated. Here, we show that disruption of ANGUSTIFOLIA3 orthologs (PpAN3s) compromises gametophore shoot formation in the moss Physcomitrium patens due to defective cell proliferation and expansion. Trans-omics analysis reveals that the downstream activity of PpAN3 is linked to arginine metabolism. Elevating arginine level by chemical treatment leads to stunted gametophores and causes Ppan3 mutant-like transcriptional changes in the wild-type plant. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtAN3 from Arabidopsis thaliana ameliorates the defective arginine metabolism and promotes gametophore formation in Ppan3 mutants. Together, these findings indicate that arginine metabolism is a key pathway associated with gametophore formation and provide evolutionary insights into the establishment of the shoot system in land plants through the integration of developmental and metabolic processes."	0
"30850331"	"Diverse Mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 Inhibition by Type IIC Anti-CRISPR Proteins.Anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) targeting CRISPR-Cas9 systems represent natural ""off switches"" for Cas9-based applications. Recently, AcrIIC1, AcrIIC2, and AcrIIC3 proteins were found to inhibit Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (NmeCas9) activity in bacterial and human cells. Here we report biochemical and structural data that suggest molecular mechanisms of AcrIIC2- and AcrIIC3-mediated Cas9 inhibition. AcrIIC2 dimer interacts with the bridge helix of Cas9, interferes with RNA binding, and prevents DNA loading into Cas9. AcrIIC3 blocks the DNA loading step through binding to a non-conserved surface of the HNH domain of Cas9. AcrIIC3 also forms additional interactions with the REC lobe of Cas9 and induces the dimerization of the AcrIIC3-Cas9 complex. While AcrIIC2 targets Cas9 orthologs from different subtypes, albeit with different efficiency, AcrIIC3 specifically inhibits NmeCas9. Structure-guided changes in NmeCas9 orthologs convert them into anti-CRISPR-sensitive proteins. Our studies provide insights into anti-CRISPR-mediated suppression mechanisms and guidelines for designing regulatory tools in Cas9-based applications."	0
"32433972"	"Predicting mRNA Abundance Directly from Genomic Sequence Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field."	0
"32937129"	"A Membrane-Associated DHH-DHHA1 Nuclease Degrades Type III CRISPR Second Messenger.Type III CRISPR-Cas systems initiate an intracellular signaling pathway to confer immunity. The signaling pathway includes synthesis of cyclic oligo-adenylate (cOA) and activation of the RNase activity of type III accessory ribonuclease Csm6/Csx1 by cOA. After the immune response, cOA should be cleared on time to avoid constant cellular RNA degradation. In this study, we find a metal-dependent cOA degradation activity in Sulfolobus islandicus. The activity is associated with the cell membrane and able to accelerate cOA clearance at a high cOA level. Further, we show that a metal-dependent and membrane-associated DHH-DHHA1 family nuclease (MAD) rapidly cleaves cOA and deactivates Csx1 ribonuclease. The cOA degradation efficiency of MAD is much higher than the cellular ring nuclease. However, the subcellular organization may prevent it from degrading nascent cOA. Together, the data suggest that MAD acts as the second cOA degrader after the ring nuclease to remove diffused redundant cOA."	0
"32101755"	"Entropic Bristles Tune the Seeding Efficiency of Prion-Nucleating Fragments.Prions of lower eukaryotes are self-templating protein aggregates with cores formed by parallel in-register beta strands. Short aggregation-prone glutamine (Q)- and asparagine (N)-rich regions embedded in longer disordered domains have been proposed to act as nucleation sites that initiate refolding of soluble prion proteins into highly ordered fibrils, termed amyloid. We demonstrate that a short Q/N-rich peptide corresponding to a proposed nucleation site in the prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion protein Sup35 is sufficient to induce infectious cytosolic prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells ectopically expressing the soluble Sup35 NM prion domain. Embedding this nucleating core in a non-native N-rich sequence that does not form amyloid but acts as an entropic bristle quadruples seeding efficiency. Our data suggest that large disordered sequences flanking an aggregation core in prion proteins act as not only solubilizers of the monomeric protein but also breakers of the formed amyloid fibrils, enhancing infectivity of the prion seeds."	0
"30982746"	"Cyclin D-Cdk4,6 Drives Cell-Cycle Progression via the Retinoblastoma Protein's C-Terminal Helix.The cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 form complexes with D-type cyclins to drive cell proliferation. A well-known target of cyclin D-Cdk4,6 is the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which inhibits cell-cycle progression until its inactivation by phosphorylation. However, the role of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 in cell-cycle progression is unclear because Rb can be phosphorylated by other cyclin-Cdks, and cyclin D-Cdk4,6 has other targets involved in cell division. Here, we show that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 docks one side of an alpha-helix in the Rb C terminus, which is not recognized by cyclins E, A, and B. This helix-based docking mechanism is shared by the p107 and p130 Rb-family members across metazoans. Mutation of the Rb C-terminal helix prevents its phosphorylation, promotes G1 arrest, and enhances Rb's tumor suppressive function. Our work conclusively demonstrates that the cyclin D-Rb interaction drives cell division and expands the diversity of known cyclin-based protein docking mechanisms."	0
"32846116"	"The Zebrafish Dorsolateral Habenula Is Required for Updating Learned Behaviors.Operant learning requires multiple cognitive processes, such as learning, prediction of potential outcomes, and decision-making. It is less clear how interactions of these processes lead to the behavioral adaptations that allow animals to cope with a changing environment. We show that juvenile zebrafish can perform conditioned place avoidance learning, with improving performance across development. Ablation of the dorsolateral habenula (dlHb), a brain region involved in associative learning and prediction of outcomes, leads to an unexpected improvement in performance and delayed memory extinction. Interestingly, the control animals exhibit rapid adaptation to a changing learning rule, whereas dlHb-ablated animals fail to adapt. Altogether, our results show that the dlHb plays a central role in switching animals' strategies while integrating new evidence with prior experience."	0
"32209484"	"Phospholipid Acyl Chain Diversity Controls the Tissue-Specific Assembly of Mitochondrial Cardiolipins.Cardiolipin (CL) is a phospholipid specific for mitochondrial membranes and crucial for many core tasks of this organelle. Its acyl chain configurations are tissue specific, functionally important, and generated via post-biosynthetic remodeling. However, this process lacks the necessary specificity to explain CL diversity, which is especially evident for highly specific CL compositions in mammalian tissues. To investigate the so far elusive regulatory origin of CL homeostasis in mice, we combine lipidomics, integrative transcriptomics, and data-driven machine learning. We demonstrate that not transcriptional regulation, but cellular phospholipid compositions are closely linked to the tissue specificity of CL patterns allowing artificial neural networks to precisely predict cross-tissue CL compositions in a consistent mechanistic specificity rationale. This is especially relevant for the interpretation of disease-related perturbations of CL homeostasis, by allowing differentiation between specific aberrations in CL metabolism and changes caused by global alterations in cellular (phospho-)lipid metabolism."	0
"32546480"	"Differences in self-association between kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 are associated with differential integrin binding.The integrin family of transmembrane adhesion receptors coordinates complex signaling networks that control the ability of cells to sense and communicate with the extracellular environment. Kindlin proteins are a central cytoplasmic component of these networks, directly binding integrin cytoplasmic domains and mediating interactions with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. The physiological importance of kindlins is well established, but how the scaffolding functions of kindlins are regulated at the molecular level is still unclear. Here, using a combination of GFP nanotrap association assays, pulldown and integrin-binding assays, and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that full-length kindlins can oligomerize (self-associate) in mammalian cells, and we propose that this self-association inhibits integrin binding and kindlin localization to focal adhesions. We show that both kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 can self-associate and that kindlin-3 self-association is more robust. Using chimeric mapping, we demonstrate that the F2PH and F3 subdomains are important for kindlin self-association. Through comparative sequence analysis of kindlin-2 and kindlin-3, we identify kindlin-3 point mutations that decrease self-association and enhance integrin binding, affording mutant kindlin-3 the ability to localize to focal adhesions. Our results support the notion that kindlin self-association negatively regulates integrin binding."	0

Both cold exposure and iAdFASNKO upregulate the sympathetic nerve fiber (SNF) modulator Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), activate SNFs, and require adipocyte cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling for beige adipocyte appearance, as it is blocked by adipocyte Gsα deficiency. Surprisingly, however, in contrast to cold-exposed mice, neither iWAT denervation nor Nrg4 loss attenuated adipocyte browning in iAdFASNKO mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of iWAT stromal cells revealed increased macrophages displaying gene expression signatures of the alternately activated type in iAdFASNKO mice, and their depletion abrogated iWAT beiging. Altogether, these findings reveal that divergent cellular pathways are sufficient to cause adipocyte browning. Importantly, adipocyte signaling to enhance alternatively activated macrophages in iAdFASNKO mice is associated with enhanced adipose thermogenesis independent of the sympathetic neuron involvement this process requires in the cold."	0

The pathogenicity and establishment of <i>S. aureus</i> infections are tightly linked to its ability to modulate host immunity. Persistent infections are often associated with mutant staphylococcal strains that have decreased susceptibility to antibiotics; however, little is known about how these mutations influence bacterial interaction with the host immune system. Here, we discovered that clinical <i>S. aureus</i> isolates activate human monocytes, leading to cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands on the monocytes. We found that expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 (UL16-binding protein 2) is associated with bacterial degradability and phagolysosomal activity. Moreover, <i>S. aureus</i>-induced ULBP2 expression was linked to altered host cell metabolism, including increased cytoplasmic (iso)citrate levels, reduced glycolytic flux, and functional mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that the ability of <i>S. aureus</i> to induce ULBP2 and proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes depends on a functional ClpP protease in <i>S. aureus</i> These findings indicate that <i>S. aureus</i> activates ULBP2 in human monocytes through immunometabolic mechanisms and reveal that <i>clpP</i> inactivation may function as a potential immune evasion mechanism. Our results provide critical insight into the interplay between the host immune system and <i>S. aureus</i> that has evolved under the dual selective pressure of host immune responses and antibiotic treatment.

One of the most studied autophagy-related proteins is LC3. Despite growing evidence that LC3 is enriched in the nucleus, its nuclear role is poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Atg8a protein, homologous to mammalian LC3, interacts with the transcription factor Sequoia in a LIR motif-dependent manner. We show that Sequoia depletion induces autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions through the enhanced expression of autophagy genes. We show that Atg8a interacts with YL-1, a component of a nuclear acetyltransferase complex, and that it is acetylated in nutrient-rich conditions. We also show that Atg8a interacts with the deacetylase Sir2, which deacetylates Atg8a during starvation to activate autophagy. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation of the expression of autophagy genes by Atg8a, which is linked to its acetylation status and its interaction with Sequoia, YL-1, and Sir2."	1

"31995761"	"The ARK Assay Is a Sensitive and Versatile Method for the Global Detection of DNA-Protein Crosslinks.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are a frequent form of DNA lesion and are strongly inhibitive in diverse DNA transactions. Despite recent developments, the biochemical detection of DPCs remains a limiting factor for the in-depth mechanistic understanding of DPC repair. Here, we develop a sensitive and versatile assay, designated ARK, for the quantitative analysis of DPCs in cells. ARK uses sequential chaotropic and detergent-based isolation of DPCs and substantially enhances sample purity, resulting in a 5-fold increase in detection sensitivity and a 10-fold reduction in background reading. We validate the ARK assay with genetic mutants with established deficiencies in DPC repair and demonstrate its robustness by using common DPC-inducing reagents, including formaldehyde, camptothecin, and etoposide. In addition, we show that the Fanconi anemia pathway contributes to the repair of DPCs. Thus, ARK is expected to facilitate various studies aimed at understanding both fundamental biology and translational applications of DNA-protein crosslink repair."	0

These enzymes contain two functional domains: a catalytic domain and a C-terminal ricin-like lectin domain comprised of three potential GalNAc recognition repeats termed α, β, and γ. The catalytic domain is responsible for binding donor and acceptor substrates and catalyzing transfer of GalNAc, whereas the lectin domain recognizes more distant extant GalNAc on previously glycosylated substrates. We previously demonstrated a novel role for the α repeat of lectin domain in influencing charged peptide preferences. Here, we further interrogate how the differentially spliced α repeat of the PGANT9A and PGANT9B <i>O</i>-glycosyltransferases confers distinct preferences for a variety of endogenous substrates. Through biochemical analyses and <i>in silico</i> modeling using preferred substrates, we find that a combination of charged residues within the α repeat and charged residues in the flexible gating loop of the catalytic domain distinctively influence the peptide substrate preferences of each splice variant. Moreover, PGANT9A and PGANT9B also display unique glycopeptide preferences. These data illustrate how changes within the noncatalytic lectin domain can alter the recognition of both peptide and glycopeptide substrates.

Here, we reveal an unexpected role for an essential DEAD-box helicase, DDX18, in antagonizing the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to prevent deposition of the repressive H3K27me3 mark onto rDNA in pluripotent cells. DDX18 binds and sequesters PRC2 in the outer layer of the nucleolus and counteracts PRC2 complex formation in vivo and in vitro. DDX18 knockdown leads to increased occupancy of PRC2 and H3K27me3 at rDNA loci, accompanied by drastically decreased rRNA transcription and reduced ribosomal protein expression and translation. Auxin-induced rapid degradation of DDX18 enhances PRC2 binding at rDNA. The inhibition of PRC2 partially rescues the effects of DDX18 depletion on rRNA transcription and ESC self-renewal. These results demonstrate a critical role for DDX18 in safeguarding the chromatin and transcriptional integrity of rDNA by counteracting the epigenetic silencing machinery to promote pluripotency."	1

We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing.

Here, using single-cell analysis, we unexpectedly found that cyclin E/A-CDK activity can only maintain Rb hyperphosphorylation starting at the onset of S phase and that CDK4/6 activity, but not cyclin E/A-CDK activity, is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb throughout G1 phase. Mitogen removal in G1 results in a gradual loss of CDK4/6 activity with a high likelihood of cells sustaining Rb hyperphosphorylation until S phase, at which point cyclin E/A-CDK activity takes over. Thus, it is short-term memory, or transient hysteresis, in CDK4/6 activity following mitogen removal that sustains Rb hyperphosphorylation, demonstrating a probabilistic rather than an irreversible molecular mechanism underlying the restriction point."	1
"30765194"	"The C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II Is a Multivalent Targeting Sequence that Supports Drosophila Development with Only Consensus Heptads.The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is composed of repeats of the consensus YSPTSPS and is an essential binding scaffold for transcription-associated factors. Metazoan CTDs have well-conserved lengths and sequence compositions arising from the evolution of divergent motifs, features thought to be essential for development. On the contrary, we show that a truncated CTD composed solely of YSPTSPS repeats supports Drosophila viability but that a CTD with enough YSPTSPS repeats to match the length of the wild-type Drosophila CTD is defective. Furthermore, a fluorescently tagged CTD lacking the rest of Pol II dynamically enters transcription compartments, indicating that the CTD functions as a signal sequence. However, CTDs with too many YSPTSPS repeats are more prone to localize to static nuclear foci separate from the chromosomes. We propose that the sequence complexity of the CTD offsets aberrant behavior caused by excessive repetitive sequences without compromising its targeting function."	0
"32521280"	"ELKS1 Captures Rab6-Marked Vesicular Cargo in Presynaptic Nerve Terminals.Neurons face unique transport challenges. They need to deliver cargo over long axonal distances and to many presynaptic nerve terminals. Rab GTPases are master regulators of vesicular traffic, but essential presynaptic Rabs have not been identified. Here, we find that Rab6, a Golgi-derived GTPase for constitutive secretion, associates with mobile axonal cargo and localizes to nerve terminals. ELKS1 is a stationary presynaptic protein with Golgin homology that binds to Rab6. Knockout and rescue experiments for ELKS1 and Rab6 establish that ELKS1 captures Rab6 cargo. The ELKS1-Rab6-capturing mechanism can be transferred to mitochondria by mistargeting ELKS1 or Rab6 to them. We conclude that nerve terminals have repurposed mechanisms from constitutive exocytosis for their highly regulated secretion. By employing Golgin-like mechanisms with anchored ELKS extending its coiled-coils to capture Rab6 cargo, they have spatially separated cargo capture from fusion. ELKS complexes connect to active zones and may mediate vesicle progression toward release sites."	1
"32937124"	"The Natural Compound Notopterol Binds and Targets JAK2/3 to Ameliorate Inflammation and Arthritis.The traditional Chinese medicinal herb Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H.T. Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients' serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway."	1
"30503775"	"Widespread Backtracking by RNA Pol II Is a Major Effector of Gene Activation, 5' Pause Release, Termination, and Transcription Elongation Rate.In addition to phosphodiester bond formation, RNA polymerase II has an RNA endonuclease activity, stimulated by TFIIS, which rescues complexes that have arrested and backtracked. How TFIIS affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIIS<sub>DN</sub>) that inhibits RNA cleavage and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow elongation early in transcription, and in 3' flanking regions where termination is enhanced by TFIIS<sub>DN</sub>, suggesting that backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination. Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes. TFIIS<sub>DN</sub> slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of elongation under normal conditions."	0
"31940495"	"Targeting the Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNA SLNCR1 by Blocking Its Sequence-Specific Binding to the Androgen Receptor.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of numerous physiological processes and diseases, especially cancers. However, development of lncRNA-based therapies is limited because the mechanisms of many lncRNAs are obscure, and interactions with functional partners, including proteins, remain uncharacterized. The lncRNA SLNCR1 binds to and regulates the androgen receptor (AR) to mediate melanoma invasion and proliferation in an androgen-independent manner. Here, we use biochemical analyses coupled with selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) RNA structure probing to show that the N-terminal domain of AR binds a pyrimidine-rich motif in an unstructured region of SLNCR1. This motif is predictive of AR binding, as we identify an AR-binding motif in lncRNA HOXA11-AS-203. Oligonucleotides that bind either the AR N-terminal domain or the AR RNA motif block the SLNCR1-AR interaction and reduce SLNCR1-mediated melanoma invasion. Delivery of oligos that block SLNCR1-AR interaction thus represent a plausible therapeutic strategy."	0
"32375027"	"Systematic Analysis of Targets of Pumilio-Mediated mRNA Decay Reveals that PUM1 Repression by DNA Damage Activates Translesion Synthesis.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a pivotal role in gene expression by modulating the stability of transcripts. However, the identification of degradation target mRNAs of RBPs remains difficult. By the combined analysis of transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilities and the binding of mRNAs to human Pumilio 1 (PUM1), we identify 48 mRNAs that both bind to PUM1 and exhibit PUM1-dependent degradation. Analysis of changes in the abundance of PUM1 and its degradation target mRNAs in RNA-seq data indicate that DNA-damaging agents negatively regulate PUM1-mediated mRNA decay. Cells exposed to cisplatin have reduced PUM1 abundance and increased PCNA and UBE2A mRNAs encoding proteins involved in DNA damage tolerance by translesion synthesis (TLS). Cells overexpressing PUM1 exhibit impaired DNA synthesis and TLS and increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. Thus, our method identifies target mRNAs of PUM1-mediated decay and reveals that cells respond to DNA damage by inhibiting PUM1-mediated mRNA decay to activate TLS."	1
"30595439"	"Helicase Subunit Cdc45 Targets the Checkpoint Kinase Rad53 to Both Replication Initiation and Elongation Complexes after Fork Stalling.Across eukaryotes, disruption of DNA replication causes an S phase checkpoint response, which regulates multiple processes, including inhibition of replication initiation and fork stabilization. How these events are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the replicative helicase component Cdc45 targets the checkpoint kinase Rad53 to distinct replication complexes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad53 binds to forkhead-associated (FHA) interaction motifs in an unstructured loop region of Cdc45, which is phosphorylated by Rad53 itself, and this interaction is necessary for the inhibition of origin firing through Sld3. Cdc45 also recruits Rad53 to stalled replication forks, which we demonstrate is important for the response to replication stress. Finally, we show that a Cdc45 mutation found in patients with Meier-Gorlin syndrome disrupts the functional interaction with Rad53 in yeast. Together, we present a single mechanism by which a checkpoint kinase targets replication initiation and elongation complexes, which may be relevant to human disease."	1
"31230815"	"TAM Kinases Promote Necroptosis by Regulating Oligomerization of MLKL.Necroptosis, a cell death pathway mediated by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling cascade downstream of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases are known for their anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and anti-inflammatory roles. Here, we identify an unexpected role of TAM kinases as promoters of necroptosis, a pro-inflammatory necrotic cell death. Pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TAM kinases results in a potent inhibition of necroptotic death in various cellular models. We identify phosphorylation of MLKL Tyr376 as a direct point of input from TAM kinases into the necroptosis signaling. The oligomerization of MLKL, but not its membranal translocation or phosphorylation by RIPK3, is controlled by TAM kinases. Importantly, both knockout and inhibition of TAM kinases protect mice from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, this study discovers that immunosuppressant TAM kinases are promoters of pro-inflammatory necroptosis, shedding light on the biological complexity of the regulation of inflammation."	1
"30853401"	"Spatiotemporal Control of ULK1 Activation by NDP52 and TBK1 during Selective Autophagy.Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis."	1

"32571875"	"PRL3 pseudophosphatase activity is necessary and sufficient to promote metastatic growth.Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are markers of cancer and promote tumor growth. They have been implicated in a variety of biochemical pathways but the physiologically relevant target of phosphatase activity has eluded 20 years of investigation. Here, we show that PRL3 catalytic activity is not required in a mouse model of metastasis. PRL3 binds and inhibits CNNM4, a membrane protein associated with magnesium transport. Analysis of PRL3 mutants specifically defective in either CNNM-binding or phosphatase activity demonstrate that CNNM binding is necessary and sufficient to promote tumor metastasis. As PRLs do have phosphatase activity, they are in fact <i>pseudo</i>-pseudophosphatases. Phosphatase activity leads to formation of phosphocysteine, which blocks CNNM binding and may play a regulatory role. We show levels of PRL cysteine phosphorylation vary in response to culture conditions and in different tissues. Examination of related protein phosphatases shows the stability of phosphocysteine is a unique and evolutionarily conserved property of PRLs. The demonstration that PRL3 functions as a pseudophosphatase has important ramifications for the design of PRL inhibitors for cancer."	1
"32049024"	"Foxp1 Regulates Neural Stem Cell Self-Renewal and Bias Toward Deep Layer Cortical Fates.The laminar architecture of the mammalian neocortex depends on the orderly generation of distinct neuronal subtypes by apical radial glia (aRG) during embryogenesis. Here, we identify critical roles for the autism risk gene Foxp1 in maintaining aRG identity and gating the temporal competency for deep-layer neurogenesis. Early in development, aRG express high levels of Foxp1 mRNA and protein, which promote self-renewing cell divisions and deep-layer neuron production. Foxp1 levels subsequently decline during the transition to superficial-layer neurogenesis. Sustained Foxp1 expression impedes this transition, preserving a population of cells with aRG identity throughout development and extending the early neurogenic period into postnatal life. FOXP1 expression is further associated with the initial formation and expansion of basal RG (bRG) during human corticogenesis and can promote the formation of cells exhibiting characteristics of bRG when misexpressed in the mouse cortex. Together, these findings reveal broad functions for Foxp1 in cortical neurogenesis."	0
"32187535"	"Morphine and Naloxone Facilitate Neural Stem Cells Proliferation via a TET1-Dependent and Receptor-Independent Pathway.Normally, opioids function in a receptor-dependent manner. They bind to opioid receptors, activate or inhibit receptor activation, and subsequently modulate downstream signal transduction. However, the complex functions of opioids and the low expression of opioid receptors and their endogenous peptide agonists in neural stem cells (NSCs) suggest that some opioids may also modulate NSCs via a receptor-independent pathway. In the current study, two opioids, morphine and naloxone, are demonstrated to facilitate NSC proliferation via a receptor-independent and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1)-dependent pathway. Morphine and naloxone penetrate cell membrane, bind to TET1 protein via three key residues (1,880-1,882), and subsequently result in facilitated proliferation of NSCs. In addition, the two opioids also inhibit the DNA demethylation ability of TET1. In summary, the current results connect opioids and DNA demethylation directly at least in NSCs and extend our understanding on both opioids and NSCs."	1

Here, we combine induced neurons (iNeurons) derived from embryonic stem cells with quantitative proteomics to reveal the dynamics and specificity of Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation under endogenous expression conditions. Targets showing elevated ubiquitylation in USP30<sup>-/-</sup> iNeurons are concentrated in components of the mitochondrial translocon, and the ubiquitylation kinetics of the vast majority of Parkin targets are unaffected, correlating with a modest kinetic acceleration in accumulation of pS65-Ub and mitophagic flux upon mitochondrial depolarization without USP30. Basally, ubiquitylated translocon import substrates accumulate, suggesting a quality control function for USP30. p97 was dispensable for Parkin ligase activity in iNeurons. This work provides an unprecedented quantitative landscape of the Parkin-modified ubiquitylome in iNeurons and reveals the underlying specificity of central regulatory elements in the pathway."	0

Important advances have been made to optimize culture conditions and define molecular criteria for naive pluripotency. However, the identity of naive-specific surface markers and the underlying molecular mechanism of naive pluripotency regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) as a prominent naive-specific surface marker by systematic proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ALPPL2 is essential for both the establishment and maintenance of naive pluripotency. Moreover, we show that ALPPL2 can interact with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 to stabilize the mRNA levels of the naive pluripotency transcription factors TFCP2L1 and STAT3 to regulate naive pluripotency. Overall, our study identifies a functional surface marker for human naive pluripotency, providing a powerful tool for human-naive-pluripotency-related mechanistic studies."	1
"32636305"	"Two highly related odorant receptors specifically detect α-bile acid pheromones in sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>).Pheromones play critical roles in habitat identification and reproductive behavior synchronization in the sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>). The bile acid 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS) is a major component of the sex pheromone mixture from male sea lamprey that induces specific olfactory and behavioral responses in conspecific individuals. Olfactory receptors interact directly with pheromones, which is the first step in their detection, but identifying the cognate receptors of specific pheromones is often challenging. Here, we deorphanized two highly related odorant receptors (ORs), OR320a and OR320b, of <i>P. marinus</i> that respond to 3kPZS. In a heterologous expression system coupled to a cAMP-responsive CRE-luciferase, OR320a and OR320b specifically responded to C<sub>24</sub> 5α-bile acids, and both receptors were activated by the same set of 3kPZS analogs. OR320a displayed larger responses to all 3kPZS analogs than did OR320b. This difference appeared to be largely determined by a single amino acid residue, Cys-79<sup>2.56</sup>, the C-terminal sixth residue relative to the most conserved residue in the second transmembrane domain (2.56) of OR320a. This region of TM2 residues 2.56-2.60 apparently is critical for the detection of steroid compounds by odorant receptors in lamprey, zebrafish, and humans. Finally, we identified OR320 orthologs in Japanese lamprey (<i>Lethenteron camtschaticum</i>), suggesting that the OR320 family may be widely present in lamprey species and that OR320 may be under purifying selection. Our results provide a system to examine the origin of olfactory steroid detection in vertebrates and to define a highly conserved molecular mechanism for steroid-ligand detection by G protein-coupled receptors."	0

To study roles for <i>MYCN</i> amplification in SCLC progression and chemoresistance, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing SCLC. In treatment-naïve mice, <i>MYCN</i> overexpression promoted cell cycle progression, suppressed infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and accelerated SCLC. <i>MYCN</i> overexpression also suppressed response to cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy, with similar findings made upon <i>MYCL</i> overexpression. We extended these data to genetically perturb chemosensitive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC. In chemosensitive PDX models, overexpression of either <i>MYCN</i> or <i>MYCL</i> also conferred a switch to chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic strategies for <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing SCLC, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA screen. We identified the deubiquitinase USP7 as a <i>MYCN</i>-associated synthetic vulnerability. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 resensitized chemoresistant <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing PDX models to chemotherapy in vivo.

"32814048"	"Fyn Kinase Controls Tau Aggregation In Vivo.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a proteinopathy exhibiting aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) as amyloid plaques and tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), whereas primary tauopathies display only a tau pathology. Aβ toxicity is mediated by Fyn kinase in a tau-dependent process; however, whether Fyn controls tau pathology in diseases that lack Aβ pathology remains unexplored. To address this, we generate the Tg/Fyn<sup>-/-</sup> mouse, which couples mutant tau overexpression with Fyn knockout. Surprisingly, Tg/Fyn<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit a near-complete ablation of NFTs, alongside reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, altered tau solubility, and diminished synaptic tau accumulation. Furthermore, Tg/Fyn<sup>-/-</sup> brain lysates elicit less tau seeding in tau biosensor cells. Lastly, the fibrillization of tau is boosted by its pseudophosphorylation at the Fyn epitope Y18. Together, this identifies Fyn as a key regulator of tau pathology independently of Aβ-induced toxicity and thereby represents a potentially valuable therapeutic target for not only AD but also tauopathies more generally."	0

Here, we report that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, but not YTHDF1, are required for reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Mechanistically, we found that YTHDF3 recruits the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase complex and conduces to reprogramming by promoting mRNA clearance of somatic genes, including Tead2 and Tgfb1, which parallels the activity of the YTHDF2-CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Ythdf2/3 deficiency represses mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and chromatin silencing at loci containing the TEAD motif, contributing to decreased reprogramming efficiency. Moreover, RNA interference of Tgfb1 or the Hippo signaling effectors Yap1, Taz, and Tead2 rescues Ythdf2/3-defective reprogramming. Overall, YTHDF2/3 couples RNA deadenylation and regulation with the clearance of somatic genes and provides insights into iPSC reprogramming at the posttranscriptional level."	1

The deafferented circuit could propagate, amplify, or mitigate input loss, thus affecting the circuit's output. How the deafferented circuit contributes to the effect on the output is poorly understood because of lack of control over loss of and access to circuit elements. Here, we control the timing and degree of rod photoreceptor ablation in mature mouse retina and uncover compensation. Following loss of half of the rods, rod bipolar cells mitigate the loss by preserving voltage output. Such mitigation allows partial recovery of ganglion cell responses. We conclude that rod death is compensated for in the circuit because ganglion cell responses to stimulation of half of the rods in an unperturbed circuit are weaker than responses after death of half of the rods. The dominant mechanism of such compensation includes homeostatic regulation of inhibition to balance the loss of excitation."	0

HP1 can bridge chromatin segments and form liquid droplets, but the biophysical principles underlying heterochromatin compartmentalization in the cell nucleus are elusive. Here, we assess mechanistically relevant features of pericentric heterochromatin compaction in mouse fibroblasts. We find that (1) HP1 has only a weak capacity to form liquid droplets in living cells; (2) the size, global accessibility, and compaction of heterochromatin foci are independent of HP1; (3) heterochromatin foci lack a separated liquid HP1 pool; and (4) heterochromatin compaction can toggle between two ""digital"" states depending on the presence of a strong transcriptional activator. These findings indicate that heterochromatin foci resemble collapsed polymer globules that are percolated with the same nucleoplasmic liquid as the surrounding euchromatin, which has implications for our understanding of chromatin compartmentalization and its functional consequences."	0

This Por1 association thereby modulates Tom22 integration into the TOM complex, guaranteeing formation of the functional trimeric TOM complex. Por1 sequestration of Tom22 dissociated from the trimeric TOM complex also enhances the dimeric TOM complex, which is preferable for the import of TIM40/MIA-dependent proteins into mitochondria.

FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation.

We find that unused miRNAs stably bind to PBs, whereas functional miRNAs, repressed mRNAs, and lncRNAs both transiently and stably localize within either the core or periphery of PBs, albeit to different extents. Consequently, translation potential and 3' versus 5' placement of miRNA target sites significantly affect the PB localization dynamics of mRNAs. Using computational modeling and supporting experimental approaches, we show that partitioning in the PB phase attenuates mRNA silencing, suggesting that physiological mRNA turnover occurs predominantly outside of PBs. Instead, our data support a PB role in sequestering unused miRNAs for surveillance and provide a framework for investigating the dynamic assembly of RNP granules by phase separation at single-molecule resolution."	0

Here we show that the E3 ligase VHL interacts with Daam2 and their mutual antagonism regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation during development. Using proteomic analysis of the Daam2-VHL complex coupled with conditional genetic knockout mouse models, we further discovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase <i>Nedd4</i> is required for developmental myelination through stabilization of VHL via K63-linked ubiquitination. Furthermore, studies in mouse demyelination models and white matter lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis corroborate the function of this pathway during remyelination after WMI.

Accordingly, activating mTOR signaling by deleting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) or overexpression of SREBP-1/2 is sufficient to increase FADS2 mRNA expression and sapienate metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and U87 glioblastoma cells, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR signaling decreases FADS2 expression and sapienate biosynthesis in MEFs with Tsc2 deletion, HUH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and orthotopic HUH7 liver xenografts. In conclusion, we show that mTOR signaling and SREBP activity are sufficient to activate sapienate metabolism by increasing FADS2 expression.

We find that C-Raf binds all mutant Ras proteins with high affinity, whereas B-Raf exhibits a striking preference for mutant K-Ras. This selectivity is mediated by the acidic, N-terminal segment of B-Raf and requires the K-Ras polybasic region for high-affinity binding. In addition, we find that C-Raf is critical for mutant H-Ras-driven signaling and that events stabilizing B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization, such as Raf inhibitor treatment or certain B-Raf mutations, can allow mutant H-Ras to engage B-Raf with increased affinity to promote tumorigenesis, thus revealing a previously unappreciated role for C-Raf in potentiating B-Raf function."	1

Here, we exploit freshly explanted pancreas specimens from metabolically phenotyped surgical patients using an in situ tissue slice technology. This approach allows assessment of β cell volume and function within pancreas samples of metabolically stratified individuals. We show that, in tissue of pre-diabetic, impaired glucose-tolerant subjects, β cell volume is unchanged, but function significantly deteriorates, exhibiting increased basal release and loss of first-phase insulin secretion. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, function within the sustained β cell volume further declines. These results indicate that dysfunction of persisting β cells is a key factor in the early development and progression of type 2 diabetes, representing a major target for diabetes prevention and therapy."	0
"32675287"	"Peroxidasin mediates bromination of tyrosine residues in the extracellular matrix.Peroxidasin is a heme peroxidase that oxidizes bromide to hypobromous acid (HOBr), a powerful oxidant that promotes the formation of the sulfilimine crosslink in collagen IV in basement membranes. We investigated whether HOBr released by peroxidasin leads to other oxidative modifications of proteins, particularly bromination of tyrosine residues, in peroxidasin-expressing PFHR9 cells. Using stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS, we detected the formation of 3-bromotyrosine, a specific biomarker of HOBr-mediated protein modification. The level of 3-bromotyrosine in extracellular matrix proteins from normally cultured cells was 1.1 mmol/mol tyrosine and decreased significantly in the presence of the peroxidasin inhibitor, phloroglucinol. A negligible amount of 3-bromotyrosine was detected in peroxidasin-knockout cells. 3-Bromotyrosine formed both during cell growth in culture and in the isolated decellularized extracellular matrix when embedded peroxidasin was supplied with hydrogen peroxide and bromide. The level of 3-bromotyrosine was significantly higher in extracellular matrix than intracellular proteins, although a low amount was detected intracellularly. 3-Bromotyrosine levels increased with higher bromide concentrations and decreased in the presence of physiological concentrations of thiocyanate and urate. However, these peroxidase substrates showed moderate to minimal inhibition of collagen IV crosslinking. Our findings provide evidence that peroxidasin promotes the formation of 3-bromotyrosine in proteins. They show that HOBr produced by peroxidasin is selective for, but not limited to, the crosslinking of collagen IV. Based on our findings, the use of 3-bromotyrosine as a specific biomarker of oxidative damage by HOBr warrants further investigation in clinical conditions linked to high peroxidasin expression."	0
"32130894"	"Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier 1 Promotes Peripheral T Cell Homeostasis through Metabolic Regulation of Thymic Development.Metabolic pathways regulate T cell development and function, but many remain understudied. Recently, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) was identified as the transporter that mediates pyruvate entry into mitochondria, promoting pyruvate oxidation. Here we find that deleting Mpc1, an obligate MPC subunit, in the hematopoietic system results in a specific reduction in peripheral αβ T cell numbers. MPC1-deficient T cells have defective thymic development at the β-selection, intermediate single positive (ISP)-to-double-positive (DP), and positive selection steps. We find that early thymocytes deficient in MPC1 display alterations to multiple pathways involved in T cell development. This results in preferred escape of more activated T cells. Finally, mice with hematopoietic deletion of Mpc1 are more susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Altogether, our study demonstrates that pyruvate oxidation by T cell precursors is necessary for optimal αβ T cell development and that its deficiency results in reduced but activated peripheral T cell populations."	0
"32234485"	"Endogenous Retroviral Envelope Syncytin Induces HIV-1 Spreading and Establishes HIV Reservoirs in Placenta.Radical cure of HIV-1 (HIV) is hampered by the establishment of HIV reservoirs and persistent infection in deep tissues despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we show that among HIV-positive women receiving suppressive ART, cells from placental tissues including trophoblasts contain HIV RNA and DNA. These viruses can be reactivated by latency reversal agents. We find that syncytin, the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus family W1 expressed on placental trophoblasts, triggers cell fusion with HIV-infected T cells. This results in cell-to-cell spread of HIV to placental trophoblasts. Such cell-to-cell spread of HIV is less sensitive to ART than free virus. Replication in syncytin-expressing cells can also produce syncytin-pseudotyped HIV, further expanding its ability to infect non-CD4 cells. These previously unrecognized mechanisms of HIV entry enable the virus to bypass receptor restriction to infect host barrier cells, thereby facilitating viral transmission and persistent infection in deep tissues."	0
"32905777"	"Hypoxia Triggers the Intravasation of Clustered Circulating Tumor Cells.Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from solid cancers in the form of single or clustered cells, and the latter display an extraordinary ability to initiate metastasis. Yet, the biological phenomena that trigger the shedding of CTC clusters from a primary cancerous lesion are poorly understood. Here, when dynamically labeling breast cancer cells along cancer progression, we observe that the majority of CTC clusters are undergoing hypoxia, while single CTCs are largely normoxic. Strikingly, we find that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting leads to primary tumor shrinkage, but it increases intra-tumor hypoxia, resulting in a higher CTC cluster shedding rate and metastasis formation. Conversely, pro-angiogenic treatment increases primary tumor size, yet it dramatically suppresses the formation of CTC clusters and metastasis. Thus, intra-tumor hypoxia leads to the formation of clustered CTCs with high metastatic ability, and a pro-angiogenic therapy suppresses metastasis formation through prevention of CTC cluster generation."	0
"32075760"	"Toll-like Receptor 2 Facilitates Oxidative Damage-Induced Retinal Degeneration.Retinal degeneration is a form of neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause of vision loss globally. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are primary components of the innate immune system involved in signal transduction. Here we show that TLR2 induces complement factors C3 and CFB, the common and rate-limiting factors of the alternative pathway in both retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and mononuclear phagocytes. Neutralization of TLR2 reduces opsonizing fragments of C3 in the outer retina and protects photoreceptor neurons from oxidative stress-induced degeneration. TLR2 deficiency also preserves tight junction expression and promotes RPE resistance to fragmentation. Finally, oxidative stress-induced formation of the terminal complement membrane attack complex and Iba1+ cell infiltration are strikingly inhibited in the TLR2-deficient retina. Our data directly implicate TLR2 as a mediator of retinal degeneration in response to oxidative stress and present TLR2 as a bridge between oxidative damage and complement-mediated retinal pathology."	0

Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P) and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation."	0

Here, we describe a mechanism of FBXL5 regulation involving its interaction with the cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex composed of MMS19, FAM96B, and CIAO1. We demonstrate that the CIA-targeting complex promotes the ability of FBXL5 to degrade IRPs. In addition, the FBXL5-CIA-targeting complex interaction is regulated by oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tension displaying a robust association in 21% O<sub>2</sub> that is severely diminished in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and contributes to O<sub>2</sub>-dependent regulation of IRP degradation. Together, these data identify a novel oxygen-dependent signaling axis that links IRP-dependent iron homeostasis with the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery."	1

With the global population set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, and the compounding effects of climate change, the planet is facing challenges that necessitate significant and rapid changes in agricultural practices. In the effort to provide food in terms of calories, the essential contribution of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to nutrition is often overlooked. Here, we focus on the importance of thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) in plant health and discuss its impact on human health. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is an essential dietary component, and deficiencies in this micronutrient underlie several diseases, notably nervous system disorders. The predominant source of dietary vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is plant-based foods. Moreover, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also vital for plants themselves, and its benefits in plant health have received less attention than in the human health sphere. In general, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is well-characterized for its role as a coenzyme in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in energy production and central metabolism, including carbon assimilation and respiration. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also emerging as an important component of plant stress responses, and several noncoenzyme roles of this vitamin are being characterized. We summarize the importance of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> in plants from the perspective of food security, including its roles in plant disease resistance, stress tolerance, and crop yield, and review the potential benefits of biofortification of crops with increased vitamin B<sub>1</sub> content to improve human health."	0
"32579923"	"Microglia Dysfunction Caused by the Loss of Rhoa Disrupts Neuronal Physiology and Leads to Neurodegeneration.Nervous tissue homeostasis requires the regulation of microglia activity. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the small GTPase Rhoa in adult microglia is sufficient to trigger spontaneous microglia activation, producing a neurological phenotype (including synapse and neuron loss, impairment of long-term potentiation [LTP], formation of β-amyloid plaques, and memory deficits). Mechanistically, loss of Rhoa in microglia triggers Src activation and Src-mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, leading to excitotoxic glutamate secretion. Inhibiting Src in microglia Rhoa-deficient mice attenuates microglia dysregulation and the ensuing neurological phenotype. We also find that the Rhoa/Src signaling pathway is disrupted in microglia of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer disease and that low doses of Aβ oligomers trigger microglia neurotoxic polarization through the disruption of Rhoa-to-Src signaling. Overall, our results indicate that disturbing Rho GTPase signaling in microglia can directly cause neurodegeneration."	1
"30846317"	"CHP1 Regulates Compartmentalized Glycerolipid Synthesis by Activating GPAT4.Cells require a constant supply of fatty acids to survive and proliferate. Fatty acids incorporate into membrane and storage glycerolipids through a series of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzymes, but how these enzymes are regulated is not well understood. Here, using a combination of CRISPR-based genetic screens and unbiased lipidomics, we identified calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a major regulator of ER glycerolipid synthesis. Loss of CHP1 severely reduces fatty acid incorporation and storage in mammalian cells and invertebrates. Mechanistically, CHP1 binds and activates GPAT4, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis. GPAT4 activity requires CHP1 to be N-myristoylated, forming a key molecular interface between the two proteins. Interestingly, upon CHP1 loss, the peroxisomal enzyme, GNPAT, partially compensates for the loss of ER lipid synthesis, enabling cell proliferation. Thus, our work identifies a conserved regulator of glycerolipid metabolism and reveals plasticity in lipid synthesis of proliferating cells."	1
"30595436"	"Replication-Coupled DNA-Protein Crosslink Repair by SPRTN and the Proteasome in Xenopus Egg Extracts.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are bulky lesions that interfere with DNA metabolism and therefore threaten genomic integrity. Recent studies implicate the metalloprotease SPRTN in S phase removal of DPCs, but how SPRTN is targeted to DPCs during DNA replication is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN and proteasome activities are coupled to DNA replication by distinct mechanisms that promote replication across immovable protein barriers."	0
"31350119"	"Hijacking the Hijackers: Escherichia coli Pathogenicity Islands Redirect Helper Phage Packaging for Their Own Benefit.Phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) represent a novel and universal class of mobile genetic elements, which have broad impact on bacterial virulence. In spite of their relevance, how the Gram-negative PICIs hijack the phage machinery for their own specific packaging and how they block phage reproduction remains to be determined. Using genetic and structural analyses, we solve the mystery here by showing that the Gram-negative PICIs encode a protein that simultaneously performs these processes. This protein, which we have named Rpp (for redirecting phage packaging), interacts with the phage terminase small subunit, forming a heterocomplex. This complex is unable to recognize the phage DNA, blocking phage packaging, but specifically binds to the PICI genome, promoting PICI packaging. Our studies reveal the mechanism of action that allows PICI dissemination in nature, introducing a new paradigm in the understanding of the biology of pathogenicity islands and therefore of bacterial pathogen evolution."	0
"31735643"	"Dynamic Regulation of ME1 Phosphorylation and Acetylation Affects Lipid Metabolism and Colorectal Tumorigenesis.PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis."	1

Combining single-cell tracking and artificial niches ex vivo, we show how cells switch from ACDs to SCDs, suggesting that they are not engaged in an obligate mode of cell division. Further, we generated SNAP-tagged histone H3-reporter mice and find that, unlike fly germline stem cells, differential fate outcomes are associated with a symmetric distribution of the H3.1 and H3.3 histone variants in mouse muscle stem cells. This versatile and efficient H3-SNAP labeling system will allow an investigation of mechanisms underlying the maintenance of epigenomic identity and plasticity in a variety of tissues."	0

Here, we report a new post-transcriptional pathway regulating autophagy involving the Pat1-Lsm (Lsm1 to Lsm7) mRNA-binding complex. Under nitrogen-starvation conditions, Pat1-Lsm binds a specific subset of autophagy-related (ATG) transcripts and prevents their 3' to 5' degradation by the exosome complex, leading to ATG mRNA stabilization and accumulation. This process is regulated through Pat1 dephosphorylation, is necessary for the efficient expression of specific Atg proteins, and is required for robust autophagy induction during nitrogen starvation. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first example of ATG transcript regulation via 3' binding factors and exosomal degradation."	0

Despite its important roles, the molecular mechanism underlying m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated gene regulation is poorly understood. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs are subject to endoribonucleolytic cleavage via YTHDF2 (m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein), HRSP12 (adaptor protein), and RNase P/MRP (endoribonucleases). We demonstrate that HRSP12 functions as an adaptor to bridge YTHDF2 and RNase P/MRP, eliciting rapid degradation of YTHDF2-bound RNAs. Transcriptome-wide analyses show that m<sup>6</sup>A RNAs that are preferentially targeted for endoribonucleolytic cleavage have an HRSP12-binding site and a RNase P/MRP-directed cleavage site upstream and downstream of the YTHDF2-binding site, respectively. We also find that a subset of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing circular RNAs associates with YTHDF2 in an HRSP12-dependent manner and is selectively downregulated by RNase P/MRP. Thus, our data expand the known functions of RNase P/MRP to endoribonucleolytic cleavage of m<sup>6</sup>A RNAs."	0

O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which act in a nutrient- and stress-responsive manner. The precise role of O-GlcNAc in adult stem cells and the relationship between O-GlcNAc and the DNA damage response (DDR) is poorly understood. Here, we show that hyper-O-GlcNacylation leads to elevated insulin signaling, hyperproliferation, and DDR activation that mimic the glucose- and oxidative-stress-induced response. We discover a feedback mechanism involving key downstream effectors of DDR, ATM, ATR, and CHK1/2 that regulates OGT stability to promote O-GlcNAcylation and elevate DDR. This O-GlcNAc-dependent regulatory pathway is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in Drosophila and the DDR in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our findings reveal a conserved mechanistic link among O-GlcNAc cycling, stem cell self-renewal, and DDR with profound implications for stem-cell-derived diseases including cancer."	1
"32268122"	"Differentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are critical for continued cellular replacement in the adult brain. Lifelong maintenance of a functional NSPC pool necessitates stringent mechanisms to preserve a pristine proteome. We find that the NSPC chaperone network robustly maintains misfolded protein solubility and stress resilience through high levels of the ATP-dependent chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Strikingly, NSPC differentiation rewires the cellular chaperone network, reducing TRiC/CCT levels and inducing those of the ATP-independent small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). This switches the proteostasis strategy in neural progeny cells to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into protective inclusions. The chaperone network of NSPCs is more effective than that of differentiated cells, leading to improved management of proteotoxic stress and amyloidogenic proteins. However, NSPC proteostasis is impaired by brain aging. The less efficient chaperone network of differentiated neural progeny may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation."	0

Despite previous work to understand individual transcription steps, we reveal a mechanism that integrates RNA Pol II cycle transitions. Surprisingly, KAP1/TRIM28 uses a previously uncharacterized chromatin reader cassette to bind hypo-acetylated histone 4 tails at promoters, guaranteeing continuous progression of RNA Pol II entry to and exit from the pause state. Upon chromatin docking, KAP1 first associates with RNA Pol II and then recruits a pathway-specific transcription factor (SMAD2) in response to cognate ligands, enabling gene-selective CDK9-dependent pause release. This coupling mechanism is exploited by tumor cells to aberrantly sustain transcriptional programs commonly dysregulated in cancer patients. The discovery of a factor integrating transcription steps expands the functional repertoire by which chromatin readers operate and provides mechanistic understanding of transcription regulation, offering alternative therapeutic opportunities to target transcriptional dysregulation."	1
"32669362"	"Ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 enhances epidermal growth factor receptor stability and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor resistance.The discovery of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations spurred the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, as the first-line treatment of lung cancers. We previously reported that differential degradation of TKI-sensitive (<i>e.g.</i> L858R) and resistant (T790M) EGFR mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. We also reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> ubiquitination assays, MS, and superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of EGF-bound EGFR, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown increases receptor sorting to lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown decreased EGFR steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive target to overcome TKI resistance."	1

However, examples of direct and rapid regulation of the metabolic pathways by the RAS-ERK pathway remain elusive. We find that physiological and oncogenic ERK signaling activation leads to acute metabolic flux stimulation through the de novo purine synthesis pathway, thereby increasing building block availability for RNA and DNA synthesis, which is required for cell growth and proliferation. We demonstrate that ERK2, but not ERK1, phosphorylates the purine synthesis enzyme PFAS (phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase) at T619 in cells to stimulate de novo purine synthesis. The expression of nonphosphorylatable PFAS (T619A) decreases purine synthesis, RAS-dependent cancer cell-colony formation, and tumor growth.

Using global nuclear run-on followed by sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), we show that CDK8 kinase activity promotes RNA polymerase II pause release in response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a universal cytokine involved in immunity and tumor surveillance. The Mediator kinase module contains CDK8 or CDK19, which are presumed to be functionally redundant. We implemented cortistatin A, chemical genetics, transcriptomics, and other methods to decouple their function while assessing enzymatic versus structural roles. Unexpectedly, CDK8 and CDK19 regulated different gene sets via distinct mechanisms. CDK8-dependent regulation required its kinase activity, whereas CDK19 governed IFN-γ responses through its scaffolding function (i.e., it was kinase independent). Accordingly, CDK8, not CDK19, phosphorylates the STAT1 transcription factor (TF) during IFN-γ stimulation, and CDK8 kinase inhibition blocked activation of JAK-STAT pathway TFs. Cytokines such as IFN-γ rapidly mobilize TFs to ""reprogram"" cellular transcription; our results implicate CDK8 and CDK19 as essential for this transcriptional reprogramming."	1

This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and suggests a mechanism of activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV.

LLPC longevity is dependent on metabolic programs distinct from short-lived plasma cells (SLPCs); however, the mechanistic basis for this difference is unclear. We have previously shown that CD28, the prototypic T cell costimulatory receptor, is expressed on both LLPCs and SLPCs but is essential only for LLPC survival. Here we show that CD28 transduces pro-survival signaling specifically in LLPCs through differential SLP76 expression. CD28 signaling in LLPCs increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial mass/respiration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Unexpectedly, CD28-mediated regulation of mitochondrial respiration, NF-κB activation, and survival was ROS dependent. IRF4, a target of NF-κB, was upregulated by CD28 activation in LLPCs and decreased IRF4 levels correlated with decreased glucose uptake, mitochondrial mass, ROS, and CD28-mediated survival. Altogether, these data demonstrate that CD28 signaling induces a ROS-dependent metabolic program required for LLPC survival."	1

Most of our understanding of Hippo signaling pertains to its cytoplasmic regulation, but how the pathway is controlled in the nucleus remains poorly understood. Here we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which CDK7 promotes Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization in the nucleus to sustain Hippo pathway outputs. We found that a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4<sup>DCAF12</sup> binds and targets Yki/Yap/Taz for ubiquitination and degradation, whereas CDK7 phosphorylates Yki/Yap/Taz at S169/S128/S90 to inhibit CRL4<sup>DCAF12</sup> recruitment, leading to Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization. As a consequence, inactivation of CDK7 reduced organ size and inhibited tumor growth, which could be reversed by restoring Yki/Yap activity.

Several studies reported that the CDK inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> promotes starvation-induced autophagy by an unknown mechanism. Here we find that p27 controls autophagy via an mTORC1-dependent mechanism in amino acid-deprived cells. During prolonged starvation, a fraction of p27 is recruited to lysosomes, where it interacts with LAMTOR1, a component of the Ragulator complex required for mTORC1 activation. Binding of p27 to LAMTOR1 prevents Ragulator assembly and mTORC1 activation, promoting autophagy. Conversely, p27<sup>-/-</sup> cells exhibit elevated mTORC1 signalling as well as impaired lysosomal activity and autophagy. This is associated with cytoplasmic sequestration of TFEB, preventing induction of the lysosomal genes required for lysosome function.

These Fds are thought to redirect the energy harvested from light to phage-encoded oxidoreductases that enhance viral fitness, but it is unclear how the biophysical properties and partner specificities of phage Fds relate to those of photosynthetic organisms. Here, results of a bioinformatics analysis using a sequence similarity network revealed that phage Fds are most closely related to cyanobacterial Fds that transfer electrons from photosystems to oxidoreductases involved in nutrient assimilation. Structural analysis of myovirus P-SSM2 Fd (pssm2-Fd), which infects the cyanobacterium <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i>, revealed high levels of similarity to cyanobacterial Fds (root mean square deviations of ≤0.5 Å). Additionally, pssm2-Fd exhibited a low midpoint reduction potential (-336 mV <i>versus</i> a standard hydrogen electrode), similar to other photosynthetic Fds, although it had lower thermostability (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i> = 28 °C) than did many other Fds. When expressed in an <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain deficient in sulfite assimilation, pssm2-Fd complemented bacterial growth when coexpressed with a <i>P. marinus</i> sulfite reductase, revealing that pssm2-Fd can transfer electrons to a host protein involved in nutrient assimilation. The high levels of structural similarity with cyanobacterial Fds and reactivity with a host sulfite reductase suggest that phage Fds evolved to transfer electrons to cyanobacterially encoded oxidoreductases."	0
"32084337"	"A Quantitative Genetic Interaction Map of HIV Infection.We have developed a platform for quantitative genetic interaction mapping using viral infectivity as a functional readout and constructed a viral host-dependency epistasis map (vE-MAP) of 356 human genes linked to HIV function, comprising >63,000 pairwise genetic perturbations. The vE-MAP provides an expansive view of the genetic dependencies underlying HIV infection and can be used to identify drug targets and study viral mutations. We found that the RNA deadenylase complex, CNOT, is a central player in the vE-MAP and show that knockout of CNOT1, 10, and 11 suppressed HIV infection in primary T cells by upregulating innate immunity pathways. This phenotype was rescued by deletion of IRF7, a transcription factor regulating interferon-stimulated genes, revealing a previously unrecognized host signaling pathway involved in HIV infection. The vE-MAP represents a generic platform that can be used to study the global effects of how different pathogens hijack and rewire the host during infection."	0
"30527665"	"Phosphorylated RB Promotes Cancer Immunity by Inhibiting NF-κB Activation and PD-L1 Expression.Aberrant expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells promotes cancer progression by suppressing cancer immunity. The retinoblastoma protein RB is a tumor suppressor known to regulate the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that RB interacts with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) protein p65 and that their interaction is primarily dependent on CDK4/6-mediated serine-249/threonine-252 (S249/T252) phosphorylation of RB. RNA-seq analysis shows a subset of NF-κB pathway genes including PD-L1 are selectively upregulated by RB knockdown or CDK4/6 inhibitor. S249/T252-phosphorylated RB inversely correlates with PD-L1 expression in patient samples. Expression of a RB-derived S249/T252 phosphorylation-mimetic peptide suppresses radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 and augments therapeutic efficacy of radiation in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of hyperphosphorylated RB in suppressing NF-κB activity and PD-L1 expression and suggest that the RB-NF-κB axis can be exploited to overcome cancer immune evasion triggered by conventional or targeted therapies."	1
"32375032"	"MicroRNA-9 Fine-Tunes Dendritic Cell Function by Suppressing Negative Regulators in a Cell-Type-Specific Manner.Dendritic cells, cells of the innate immune system, are found in a steady state poised to respond to activating stimuli. Once stimulated, they rapidly undergo dynamic changes in gene expression to adopt an activated phenotype capable of stimulating immune responses. We find that the microRNA miR-9 is upregulated in both bone marrow-derived DCs and conventional DC1s but not in conventional DC2s following stimulation. miR-9 expression in BMDCs and conventional DC1s promotes enhanced DC activation and function, including the ability to stimulate T cell activation and control tumor growth. We find that miR-9 regulated the expression of several negative regulators of transcription, including the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group factor 6 (Pcgf6). These findings demonstrate that miR-9 facilitates the transition of DCs from steady state to mature state by regulating the expression of several negative regulators of DC function in a cell-type-specific manner."	1
"31444105"	"Evolution of Inosine-Specific Endonuclease V from Bacterial DNase to Eukaryotic RNase.Endonuclease V (EndoV) cleaves the second phosphodiester bond 3' to a deaminated adenosine (inosine). Although highly conserved, EndoV homologs change substrate preference from DNA in bacteria to RNA in eukaryotes. We have characterized EndoV from six different species and determined crystal structures of human EndoV and three EndoV homologs from bacteria to mouse in complex with inosine-containing DNA/RNA hybrid or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Inosine recognition is conserved, but changes in several connecting loops in eukaryotic EndoV confer recognition of 3 ribonucleotides upstream and 7 or 8 bp of dsRNA downstream of the cleavage site, and bacterial EndoV binds only 2 or 3 nt flanking the scissile phosphate. In addition to the two canonical metal ions in the active site, a third Mn<sup>2+</sup> that coordinates the nucleophilic water appears necessary for product formation. Comparison of EndoV with its homologs RNase H1 and Argonaute reveals the principles by which these enzymes recognize RNA versus DNA."	0
"30581142"	"Drp1-Zip1 Interaction Regulates Mitochondrial Quality Surveillance System.Mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control process for eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria, can be induced by a response of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial division. However, the coordination between MMP and mitochondrial division for selecting the damaged portion of the mitochondrial network is less understood. Here, we found that MMP is reduced focally at a fission site by the Drp1 recruitment, which is initiated by the interaction of Drp1 with mitochondrial zinc transporter Zip1 and Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry through the Zip1-MCU complex. After division, healthy mitochondria restore MMP levels and participate in the fusion-fission cycle again, but mitochondria that fail to restore MMP undergo mitophagy. Thus, interfering with the interaction between Drp1 and Zip1 blocks the reduction of MMP and the subsequent mitophagic selection of damaged mitochondria. These results suggest that Drp1-dependent fission provides selective pressure for eliminating ""bad sectors"" in the mitochondrial network, serving as a mitochondrial quality surveillance system."	1
"32470318"	"Ectosomal PKM2 Promotes HCC by Inducing Macrophage Differentiation and Remodeling the Tumor Microenvironment.Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles are important mediators of cell-to-cell communication during tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived ectosomes remodel the tumor microenvironment to facilitate HCC progression in an ectosomal PKM2-dependent manner. HCC-derived ectosomal PKM2 induced not only metabolic reprogramming in monocytes but also STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus to upregulate differentiation-associated transcription factors, leading to monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and tumor microenvironment remodeling. In HCC cells, sumoylation of PKM2 induced its plasma membrane targeting and subsequent ectosomal excretion via interactions with ARRDC1. The PKM2-ARRDC1 association in HCC was reinforced by macrophage-secreted cytokines/chemokines in a CCL1-CCR8 axis-dependent manner, further facilitating PKM2 excretion from HCC cells to form a feedforward regulatory loop for tumorigenesis. In the clinic, ectosomal PKM2 was clearly detected in the plasma of HCC patients. This study highlights a mechanism by which ectosomal PKM2 remodels the tumor microenvironment and reveals ectosomal PKM2 as a potential diagnostic marker for HCC."	1
"30612880"	"Multisite Phosphorylation of S6K1 Directs a Kinase Phospho-code that Determines Substrate Selection.Multisite phosphorylation of kinases can induce on-off or graded regulation of catalytic activity; however, its influence on substrate specificity remains unclear. Here, we show that multisite phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) alters target selection. Agonist-inducible phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) by S6K1 in monocytes and adipocytes requires not only canonical phosphorylation at Thr<sup>389</sup> by mTORC1 but also phosphorylation at Ser<sup>424</sup> and Ser<sup>429</sup> in the C terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). S6K1 phosphorylation at these additional sites induces a conformational switch and is essential for high-affinity binding and phosphorylation of EPRS, but not canonical S6K1 targets, e.g., ribosomal protein S6. Unbiased proteomic analysis identified additional targets phosphorylated by multisite phosphorylated S6K1 in insulin-stimulated adipocytes-namely, coenzyme A synthase, lipocalin 2, and cortactin. Thus, embedded within S6K1 is a target-selective kinase phospho-code that integrates signals from mTORC1 and Cdk5 to direct an insulin-stimulated, post-translational metabolon determining adipocyte lipid metabolism."	1

"32611769"	"Methyltransferase-like 21C (METTL21C) methylates alanine tRNA synthetase at Lys-943 in muscle tissue.Protein-lysine methylation is a common posttranslational modification (PTM) throughout the human proteome that plays important roles in diverse biological processes. In humans, there are >100 known and candidate protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs), many of which are linked to human diseases. Methyltransferase-like protein 21C (METTL21C) is a PKMT implicated in muscle biology that has been reported to methylate valosin-containing protein/p97 (VCP) and heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8). However, a clear <i>in vitro</i> methyltransferase activity for METTL21C remains yet to be demonstrated, and whether it is an active enzyme that directly methylates substrate(s) <i>in vivo</i> is unclear. Here, we used an unbiased biochemistry-based screening assay coupled to MS, which identified alanine tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) as a direct substrate of METTL21C. We found that METTL21C catalyzes methylation of Lys-943 of AARS1 (AARS1-K943me) both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i><i>In vitro</i> METTL21C-mediated AARS1 methylation was independent of ATP or tRNA molecules. Unlike for AARS1, and in conflict with previous reports, we did not detect METTL21C methylation of VCP and HSPA8. AARS1-K943 methylation in HEK293T cells depends upon METTL21C levels. Finally, METTL2C was almost exclusively expressed in muscle tissue, and, accordingly, we detected METTL21C-catalyzed methylation of AARS1 in mouse skeletal muscle tissue. These results reveal that AARS1 is a <i>bona fide in vitro</i> substrate of METTL21C and suggest a role for the METTL21C-AARS1 axis in the regulation of protein synthesis in muscle tissue. Moreover, our study describes a straightforward protocol for elucidating the physiological substrates of poorly characterized or uncharacterized PKMTs."	1
"32579913"	"Structure-Based Identification and Functional Characterization of a Lipocalin in the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Proteins of the lipocalin family are known to bind small hydrophobic ligands and are involved in various physiological processes ranging from lipid transport to oxidative stress responses. The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains a single protein PF3D7_0925900 with a lipocalin signature. Using crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that the protein has a tetrameric structure of typical lipocalin monomers; hence we name it P. falciparum lipocalin (PfLCN). We show that PfLCN is expressed in the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite and localizes to the parasitophorous and food vacuoles. Conditional knockdown of PfLCN impairs parasite development, which can be rescued by treatment with the radical scavenger Trolox or by temporal inhibition of hemoglobin digestion. This suggests a key function of PfLCN in counteracting oxidative stress-induced cell damage during multiplication of parasites within erythrocytes."	0
"32460017"	"Pyruvate Kinase M2 Promotes the Activation of Dendritic Cells by Enhancing IL-12p35 Expression.Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging evidence has demonstrated metabolic reprogramming during DC activation. However, how DC activation is linked with metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here we show that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the last step of glycolysis, is critical for LPS-induced DC activation. Upon DC activation, JNK signaling stimulated p300 association with PKM2 for the acetylation of lysine 433, a classic posttranslational modification critical for PKM2 destabilization and nuclear re-localization. Subsequently, nuclear PKM2 partnered with c-Rel to enhance Il12p35 expression, which is important for Th1 cell differentiation. Meanwhile, decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 due to detetramerization facilitated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, helping DCs meet their need for biomacromolecules. Together, we provide evidence for metabolic control of DC activation and offer insights into aberrant immune responses due to dysregulated Th1 functions."	1
"32348780"	"A Family of Argonaute-Interacting Proteins Gates Nuclear RNAi.Nuclear RNA interference (RNAi) pathways work together with histone modifications to regulate gene expression and enact an adaptive response to transposable RNA elements. In the germline, nuclear RNAi can lead to trans-generational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) of gene silencing. We identified and characterized a family of nuclear Argonaute-interacting proteins (ENRIs) that control the strength and target specificity of nuclear RNAi in C. elegans, ensuring faithful inheritance of epigenetic memories. ENRI-1/2 prevent misloading of the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 with small RNAs that normally effect maternal piRNAs, which prevents precocious nuclear translocation of NRDE-3 in the early embryo. Additionally, they are negative regulators of nuclear RNAi triggered from exogenous sources. Loss of ENRI-3, an unstable protein expressed mostly in the male germline, misdirects the RNAi response to transposable elements and impairs TEI. The ENRIs determine the potency and specificity of nuclear RNAi responses by gating small RNAs into specific nuclear Argonautes."	1

However, only a subset of patients achieves durable responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of the immune checkpoint pathways are not completely understood. Here, we report that PD-L1 translocates from the plasma membrane into the nucleus through interactions with components of the endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, regulated by p300-mediated acetylation and HDAC2-dependent deacetylation of PD-L1. Moreover, PD-L1 deficiency leads to compromised expression of multiple immune-response-related genes. Genetically or pharmacologically modulating PD-L1 acetylation blocks its nuclear translocation, reprograms the expression of immune-response-related genes and, as a consequence, enhances the anti-tumour response to PD-1 blockade. Thus, our results reveal an acetylation-dependent regulation of PD-L1 nuclear localization that governs immune-response gene expression, and thereby advocate targeting PD-L1 translocation to enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade."	1
"32111741"	"The Parkinson's disease-associated kinase LRRK2 regulates genes required for cell adhesion, polarization, and chemotaxis in activated murine macrophages.Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) encodes a complex protein that includes kinase and GTPase domains. Genome-wide association studies have identified dominant <i>LRRK2</i> alleles that predispose their carriers to late-onset idiotypic Parkinson's disease (PD) and also to autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease. Considerable evidence indicates that PD initiation and progression involve activation of innate immune functions in microglia, which are brain-resident macrophages. Here we asked whether LRRK2 modifies inflammatory signaling and how this modification might contribute to PD and Crohn's disease. We used RNA-Seq-based high-resolution transcriptomics to compare gene expression in activated primary macrophages derived from WT and <i>Lrrk2</i> knockout mice. Remarkably, expression of a single gene, Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (<i>Rapgef3</i>), was strongly up-regulated in the absence of LRRK2 and down-regulated in its presence. We observed similar regulation of <i>Rapgef3</i> expression in cells treated with a highly specific inhibitor of LRRK2 protein kinase activity. <i>Rapgef3</i> encodes an exchange protein, activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC-1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the small GTPase Rap-1. Rap-1 mediates cell adhesion, polarization, and directional motility, and our results indicate that LRRK2 modulates chemotaxis of microglia and macrophages. Dominant PD-associated <i>LRRK2</i> alleles may suppress EPAC-1 activity, further restricting motility and preventing efficient migration of microglia to sites of neuronal damage. Functional analysis <i>in vivo</i> in a subclinical infection model also indicated that Lrrk2 subtly modifies the inflammatory response. These results indicate that LRRK2 modulates the expression of genes involved in murine immune cell chemotaxis."	1
"32268103"	"Shank2 Binds to aPKC and Controls Tight Junction Formation with Rap1 Signaling during Establishment of Epithelial Cell Polarity.Epithelial cells establish apicobasal polarity by forming tight junctions (TJs) at the apical-lateral boundary, which play fundamental roles in physiological functions. An evolutionarily conserved atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-partitioning defective (PAR) complex functions as a platform for TJ assembly during cell polarity establishment. However, how this complex converts the spatial cues into a subsequent active unit is unclear. Here, we identify an epithelial isoform of Shank2 as a mediator of the aPKC-PAR complex. Shank2 binds to and colocalizes with aPKC at apical junctional regions of polarized epithelial cells. Shank2 knockdown results in defects in TJ formation. Mechanistically, we find that the N-terminal SPN domain is required for the junctional localization of Shank2 and binds to the active form of Rap1 small GTPase, which is involved in TJ formation. Our findings suggest that a close physical and functional relationship between aPKC and Shank2-active Rap1 signaling serves as the platform for TJ assembly to regulate epithelial cell polarity."	1
"31278053"	"HAT1 Coordinates Histone Production and Acetylation via H4 Promoter Binding.The energetic costs of duplicating chromatin are large and therefore likely depend on nutrient sensing checkpoints and metabolic inputs. By studying chromatin modifiers regulated by epithelial growth factor, we identified histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) as an induced gene that enhances proliferation through coordinating histone production, acetylation, and glucose metabolism. In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase, we isolated a HAT1-containing complex bound specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1-dependent transcription of H4 genes required an acetate-sensitive promoter element. HAT1 expression was critical for S-phase progression and maintenance of H3 lysine 9 acetylation at proliferation-associated genes, including histone genes. Therefore, these data describe a feedforward circuit whereby HAT1 captures acetyl groups on nascent histones and drives H4 production by chromatin binding to support chromatin replication and acetylation. These findings have important implications for human disease, since high HAT1 levels associate with poor outcomes across multiple cancer types."	0

However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in human cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene <i>RAB39b</i> are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain remain unknown. We generated <i>Rab39b</i> knockout (KO) mice and found that they exhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD behaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human cerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation and impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble neurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b interacts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly enhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely detectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling rescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by <i>RAB39b</i> mutations. Therefore, <i>RAB39b</i> mutation promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity and alters cortical neurogenesis, leading to macrocephaly and autistic-like behaviors. Our studies provide new insights into neurodevelopmental dysregulation and common pathways associated with ASD across species."	1
"32049014"	"Hepatic DNAJB9 Drives Anabolic Biasing to Reduce Steatosis and Obesity.Nutrients stimulate the anabolic synthesis of proteins and lipids, but selective insulin resistance in obesity biases the anabolic program toward lipogenesis. Here, we report the identification of a DNAJB9-driven program that favors protein synthesis and energy production over lipid accumulation. We show there are two pools of DNAJB9 cochaperone. DNAJB9 in the ER lumen promotes the degradation of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1c through ERAD, whereas its counterpart on the ER membrane promotes the assembly of mTORC2 in the cytosol and stimulates the synthesis of proteins and ATP. The expression of Dnajb9 is induced by nutrients and downregulated in the obese mouse liver. Restoration of hepatic DNAJB9 expression effectively improves insulin sensitivity, restores protein synthesis, and suppresses food intake, accompanied by reduced hepatic steatosis and adiposity in multiple mouse models of obesity. Therefore, targeting the anabolic balance may provide a unique opportunity to tackle obesity and diabetes."	1

The molecular events underlying how a given physiological stimulus changes this ratio to trigger apoptosis remains unclear. We report here that human 17-β-estradiol (E2) and its related steroid hormones induce apoptosis by binding directly to phosphodiesterase 3A, which in turn recruits and stabilizes an otherwise fast-turnover protein Schlafen 12 (SLFN12). The elevated SLFN12 binds to ribosomes to exclude the recruitment of signal recognition particles (SRPs), thereby blocking the continuous protein translation occurring on the endoplasmic reticulum of E2-treated cells. These proteins include Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, whose ensuing decrease triggers apoptosis. The SLFN12 protein and an apoptosis activation marker were co-localized in syncytiotrophoblast of human placentas, where levels of estrogen-related hormones are high, and dynamic cell turnover by apoptosis is critical for successful implantation and placenta development."	1
"32320669"	"Beta-Catenin Causes Adrenal Hyperplasia by Blocking Zonal Transdifferentiation.Activating mutations in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway are key drivers of hyperplasia, the gateway for tumor development. In a wide range of tissues, this occurs primarily through enhanced effects on cellular proliferation. Whether additional mechanisms contribute to β-catenin-driven hyperplasia remains unknown. The adrenal cortex is an ideal system in which to explore this question, as it undergoes hyperplasia following somatic β-catenin gain-of-function (βcat-GOF) mutations. Targeting βcat-GOF to zona Glomerulosa (zG) cells leads to a progressive hyperplastic expansion in the absence of increased proliferation. Instead, we find that hyperplasia results from a functional block in the ability of zG cells to transdifferentiate into zona Fasciculata (zF) cells. Mechanistically, zG cells demonstrate an upregulation of Pde2a, an inhibitor of zF-specific cAMP/PKA signaling. Hyperplasia is further exacerbated by trophic factor stimulation leading to organomegaly. Together, these data indicate that β-catenin drives adrenal hyperplasia through both proliferation-dependent and -independent mechanisms."	0

Here, we identify Pvt1b, a p53-dependent isoform of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Pvt1, expressed 50 kb downstream of Myc, which becomes induced by DNA damage or oncogenic signaling and accumulates near its site of transcription. We show that production of the Pvt1b RNA is necessary and sufficient to suppress Myc transcription in cis without altering the chromatin organization of the locus. Inhibition of Pvt1b increases Myc levels and transcriptional activity and promotes cellular proliferation. Furthermore, Pvt1b loss accelerates tumor growth, but not tumor progression, in an autochthonous mouse model of lung cancer. These findings demonstrate that Pvt1b acts at the intersection of the p53 and Myc transcriptional networks to reinforce the anti-proliferative activities of p53."	1
"31812350"	"Targeting UBE4A Revives Viperin Protein in Epithelium to Enhance Host Antiviral Defense.Mutation and prevalence of pathogenic viruses prompt the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Viperin is a potent antiviral protein that inhibits a broad range of viruses. Unexpectedly, we found that Viperin protein production in epithelium is defective in response to both viruses and interferons (IFNs). We further revealed that viruses and IFNs stimulate expression of the acetyltransferase HAT1, which induces Lys197-acetylation on Viperin. Viperin acetylation in turn recruits UBE4A that stimulates K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys206 of Viperin, leading to Viperin protein degradation. Importantly, UBE4A deficiency restores Viperin protein production in epithelium. We then designed interfering peptides (IPs) to inhibit UBE4A binding with Viperin. We found that VIP-IP3 rescues Viperin protein production in epithelium and therefore enhances cellular antiviral activity. VIP-IP3 renders mice more resistant to viral infection. These findings could provide strategies for both enhancing host broad-spectrum antiviral response and improving the efficacy of IFN-based antiviral therapy."	1

It has been implicated in cancer and the Alazami syndrome, a severe developmental disorder. Here, we report a so far unknown role of this protein in RNA modification. We show that LARP7 physically connects the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) with a distinct subset of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guiding U6 2'-O-methylation. Consistently, these modifications are severely compromised in the absence of LARP7. Although general splicing remains largely unaffected, transcriptome-wide analysis revealed perturbations in alternative splicing in LARP7-depleted cells. Importantly, we identified defects in 2'-O-methylation of the U6 snRNA in Alazami syndrome siblings carrying a LARP7 mutation. Our data identify LARP7 as a bridging factor for snoRNA-guided modification of the U6 snRNA and suggest that alterations in splicing fidelity contribute to the etiology of the Alazami syndrome."	1
"32668239"	"The Apparent Requirement for Protein Synthesis during G2 Phase Is due to Checkpoint Activation.Protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g., cycloheximide) block mitotic entry, suggesting that cell cycle progression requires protein synthesis until right before mitosis. However, cycloheximide is also known to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which can delay mitotic entry through a G2/M checkpoint. Here, we ask whether checkpoint activation or a requirement for protein synthesis is responsible for the cycloheximide effect. We find that p38 inhibitors prevent cycloheximide-treated cells from arresting in G2 phase and that G2 duration is normal in approximately half of these cells. The Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 and Wee1/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285 also prevent cycloheximide from blocking mitotic entry, raising the possibility that Wee1 and/or Myt1 mediate the cycloheximide-induced G2 arrest. Thus, protein synthesis during G2 phase is not required for mitotic entry, at least when the p38 checkpoint pathway is abrogated. However, M phase progression is delayed in cycloheximide-plus-kinase-inhibitor-treated cells, emphasizing the different requirements of protein synthesis for timely entry and completion of mitosis."	1

The SC structure, resolved at up to 3.8 Å in four distinct states, suggests that CoQ oxidation may be rate limiting because of unequal access of CoQ to the active sites of CIII<sub>2</sub>. CI shows a transition between ""closed"" and ""open"" conformations, accompanied by the striking rotation of a key transmembrane helix.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms have been poorly elucidated. Here we show, in an animal model of internal capsular infarct, that GABA-synthesizing reactive astrocytes in distant cortical areas cause glucose hypometabolism via tonic inhibition of neighboring neurons. We find that reversal of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis, by pharmacological inhibition and astrocyte-specific gene silencing of MAO-B, reverses the reduction in cortical glucose metabolism. Moreover, induction of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis by cortical injection of putrescine or adenovirus recapitulates cortical hypometabolism. Furthermore, MAO-B inhibition causes a remarkable recovery from post-stroke motor deficits when combined with a rehabilitation regimen. Collectively, our data indicate that cortical glucose hypometabolism in subcortical stroke is caused by aberrant astrocytic GABA and MAO-B inhibition and that attenuating cortical hypometabolism can be a therapeutic approach in subcortical stroke."	0
"32814043"	"Proteolytic Restriction of Chordin Range Underlies BMP Gradient Formation.A fundamental question in developmental biology is how morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), form precise signaling gradients to impart positional and functional identity to the cells of the early embryo. We combine rigorous mutant analyses with quantitative immunofluorescence to determine that the proteases Bmp1a and Tolloid spatially restrict the BMP antagonist Chordin in dorsoventral (DV) axial patterning of the early zebrafish gastrula. We show that maternally deposited Bmp1a plays an unexpected and non-redundant role in establishing the BMP signaling gradient, while the Bmp1a/Tolloid antagonist Sizzled is surprisingly dispensable. Combining computational modeling and in vivo analyses with an immobile Chordin construct, we demonstrate that long-range Chordin diffusion is not necessary for BMP gradient formation and DV patterning. Our data do not support a counter-gradient of Chordin and instead favor a Chordin sink, established by Bmp1a and Tolloid, as the primary mechanism that drives BMP gradient formation."	1

For CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can function as helpers (T<sub>H</sub>) to amplify magnitude and functionality or as regulatory cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) capable of profound inhibition. It is unclear what determines differentiation to these phenotypes and whether pathogens provoke alternate programs. We find that, depending on the size of initial dose, Listeria infection drives CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to act as T<sub>H</sub> or induces rapid polyclonal conversion to immunosuppressive T<sub>reg</sub>. Conversion to T<sub>reg</sub> depends on the TLR9 and IL-12 pathways elicited by CD8α<sup>+</sup> dendritic cell (DC) sensing of danger-associated neutrophil self-DNA. These findings resolve long-standing questions regarding the conditional requirement for T<sub>H</sub> amongst pathogens and reveal a remarkable degree of plasticity in the function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can be quickly converted to T<sub>reg</sub>in vivo by infection-mediated immune modulation."	0
"32023483"	"Genome-wide Screening Identifies SFMBT1 as an Oncogenic Driver in Cancer with VHL Loss.von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a critical tumor suppressor in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). It is important to identify additional therapeutic targets in ccRCC downstream of VHL loss besides hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α). By performing a genome-wide screen, we identified Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 1 (SFMBT1) as a candidate pVHL target. SFMBT1 was considered to be a transcriptional repressor but its role in cancer remains unclear. ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations displayed elevated SFMBT1 protein levels. SFMBT1 hydroxylation on Proline residue 651 by EglN1 mediated its ubiquitination and degradation governed by pVHL. Depletion of SFMBT1 abolished ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Integrated analyses of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and patient prognosis identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a key SFMBT1 target gene contributing to its oncogenic phenotype. Therefore, the pVHL-SFMBT1-SPHK1 axis serves as a potential therapeutic avenue for ccRCC."	1
"32518161"	"Loss of the RNA-binding protein Rbm15 disrupts liver maturation in zebrafish.Liver organogenesis begins with hepatic precursors in the foregut endoderm, followed by hepatoblast specification, differentiation, outgrowth, and maturation for the formation of functional hepatocytes. Although several signaling pathways and critical factors that regulate liver specification, differentiation, and proliferation have been identified, little is known about how liver maturation is regulated. Here, we used a screen for mutations affecting liver development in zebrafish and identified a <i>cq96</i> mutant that exhibits a specific defect in liver maturation. Results from positional cloning revealed that <i>cq96</i> encodes an RNA-binding protein, Rbm15, which is an evolutionarily conserved Spen family protein and known to play a crucial role in RNA m6A modification, nuclear export, and alternative splicing. However, a function of Rbm15 in embryonic liver development has not been reported. We found that <i>Rbm15</i> is specifically expressed in the liver after its differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of <i>rbm15</i> repressed hepatic maturation, but did not affect hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in <i>rbm15</i>-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin treatment partially restored normal hepatic gene expression as well as the nuclear location of the transcription factor Hnf4a. Taken together, these results reveal an unexpected role of Rbm15 in liver maturation."	0

The introduction of a human Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD)-inducing mutation into the <i>C. elegans</i> lamin (LMN-Y59C), recapitulates many muscular dystrophy phenotypes, and correlates with hyper-sequestration of a heterochromatic array at the nuclear periphery in muscle cells. Using muscle-specific emerin Dam-ID in worms, we monitored the effects of the mutation on endogenous chromatin. An increased contact with the nuclear periphery along chromosome arms, and an enhanced release of chromosomal centers, coincided with the disease phenotypes of reduced locomotion and compromised sarcomere integrity. The coupling of the LMN-Y59C mutation with the ablation of CEC-4, a chromodomain protein that anchors H3K9-methylated chromatin at the nuclear envelope (NE), suppressed the muscle-associated disease phenotypes. Deletion of <i>cec-4</i> also rescued LMN-Y59C-linked alterations in chromatin organization and some changes in transcription. Sequences that changed position in the LMN-Y59C mutant, are enriched for E2F (EFL-2)-binding sites, consistent with previous studies suggesting that altered Rb-E2F interaction with lamin A may contribute to muscle dysfunction. In summary, we were able to counteract the dominant muscle-specific defects provoked by LMNA mutation by the ablation of a lamin-associated H3K9me anchor, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for EDMD."	0
"31940492"	"FBXW7 Confers Radiation Survival by Targeting p53 for Degradation.The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in integrating a wide variety of stress responses. Therefore, p53 levels are precisely regulated by multiple ubiquitin ligases. In this study, we report that FBXW7, a substrate recognition component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ligase, interacts with and targets p53 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation after exposure to ionizing radiation or etoposide. Mechanistically, DNA damage activates ATM to phosphorylate p53 on Ser33 and Ser37, which facilitates the FBXW7 binding and subsequent p53 degradation by SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup>. Inactivation of ATM or SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup> by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown/knockout approaches extends the p53 protein half-life upon DNA damage in an MDM2-independent manner. Biologically, FBXW7 inactivation sensitizes cancer cells to radiation or etoposide by stabilizing p53 to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our study elucidates a mechanism by which FBXW7 confers cancer cell survival during radiotherapy or chemotherapy via p53 targeting."	1
"32006464"	"Localized Inhibition of Protein Phosphatase 1 by NUAK1 Promotes Spliceosome Activity and Reveals a MYC-Sensitive Feedback Control of Transcription.Deregulated expression of MYC induces a dependence on the NUAK1 kinase, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this dependence have not been fully clarified. Here, we show that NUAK1 is a predominantly nuclear protein that associates with a network of nuclear protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interactors and that PNUTS, a nuclear regulatory subunit of PP1, is phosphorylated by NUAK1. Both NUAK1 and PNUTS associate with the splicing machinery. Inhibition of NUAK1 abolishes chromatin association of PNUTS, reduces spliceosome activity, and suppresses nascent RNA synthesis. Activation of MYC does not bypass the requirement for NUAK1 for spliceosome activity but significantly attenuates transcription inhibition. Consequently, NUAK1 inhibition in MYC-transformed cells induces global accumulation of RNAPII both at the pause site and at the first exon-intron boundary but does not increase mRNA synthesis. We suggest that NUAK1 inhibition in the presence of deregulated MYC traps non-productive RNAPII because of the absence of correctly assembled spliceosomes."	1
"32640220"	"WRNIP1 Is Recruited to DNA Interstrand Crosslinks and Promotes Repair.The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Many FA proteins are recruited to ICLs in a timely fashion so that coordinated repair can occur. However, the mechanism of this process is poorly understood. Here, we report the purification of a FANCD2-containing protein complex with multiple subunits, including WRNIP1. Using live-cell imaging, we show that WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs quickly after their appearance, promoting repair. The observed recruitment facilitates subsequent recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex. Depletion of WRNIP1 sensitizes cells to ICL-forming drugs. We find that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its UBZ domain are required to facilitate recruitment of FANCD2/FANCI and promote repair. Altogether, we describe a mechanism by which WRNIP1 is recruited rapidly to ICLs, resulting in chromatin loading of the FANCD2/FANCI complex in an unusual process entailing ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its integral UBZ domain."	1
"32320654"	"Cellular Importin-α3 Expression Dynamics in the Lung Regulate Antiviral Response Pathways against Influenza A Virus Infection.Importin-α adaptor proteins orchestrate dynamic nuclear transport processes involved in cellular homeostasis. Here, we show that importin-α3, one of the main NF-κB transporters, is the most abundantly expressed classical nuclear transport factor in the mammalian respiratory tract. Importin-α3 promoter activity is regulated by TNF-α-induced NF-κB in a concentration-dependent manner. High-level TNF-α-inducing highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (HPAIVs) isolated from fatal human cases harboring human-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627K, 701N) significantly downregulate importin-α3 mRNA expression in primary lung cells. Importin-α3 depletion is restored upon back-mutating the HPAIV polymerase into an avian-type signature (PB2 627E, 701D) that can no longer induce high TNF-α levels. Importin-α3-deficient mice show reduced NF-κB-activated antiviral gene expression and increased influenza lethality. Thus, importin-α3 plays a key role in antiviral immunity against influenza. Lifting the bottleneck in importin-α3 availability in the lung might provide a new strategy to combat respiratory virus infections."	1
"31896690"	"Genomic imprinting in plants-revisiting existing models.Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon leading to parentally biased gene expression. Throughout the years, extensive efforts have been made to characterize the epigenetic marks underlying imprinting in animals and plants. As a result, DNA methylation asymmetries between parental genomes emerged as the primary factor controlling the imprinting status of many genes. Nevertheless, the data accumulated so far suggest that this process cannot solely explain the imprinting of all genes. In this review, we revisit the current models explaining imprinting regulation in plants, and discuss novel regulatory mechanisms that could function independently of parental DNA methylation asymmetries in the establishment of imprinting."	0
"32579926"	"Recently Evolved Enhancers Emerge with High Interindividual Variability and Less Frequently Associate with Disease.Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA such as enhancers underlie a wide variety of diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. As enhancers rapidly evolve, understanding their function and configuration in non-human disease models can have important clinical applications. Here, we analyze enhancer configurations in tissues isolated from the common marmoset, a widely used primate model for human disease. Integrating these data with human and mouse data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive B-compartments. Our data show that enhancers typically emerge as instable elements with minimal biological impact prior to their integration in a transcriptional program. Furthermore, our data provide insight into which trait variations in enhancers can be faithfully modeled using the common marmoset."	0
"31130363"	"Cyclin F Controls Cell-Cycle Transcriptional Outputs by Directing the Degradation of the Three Activator E2Fs.E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3A, the three activators of the E2F family of transcription factors, are key regulators of the G1/S transition, promoting transcription of hundreds of genes critical for cell-cycle progression. We found that during late S and in G2, the degradation of all three activator E2Fs is controlled by cyclin F, the substrate receptor of 1 of 69 human SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3A interact with the cyclin box of cyclin F via their conserved N-terminal cyclin binding motifs. In the short term, E2F mutants unable to bind cyclin F remain stable throughout the cell cycle, induce unscheduled transcription in G2 and mitosis, and promote faster entry into the next S phase. However, in the long term, they impair cell fitness. We propose that by restricting E2F activity to the S phase, cyclin F controls one of the main and most critical transcriptional engines of the cell cycle."	1
"31628042"	"PTPS Facilitates Compartmentalized LTBP1 S-Nitrosylation and Promotes Tumor Growth under Hypoxia.GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR) are sequentially responsible for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a known co-factor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The implication of BH4-biosynthesis process in tumorigenesis remains to be investigated. Here, we show that PTPS, which is highly expressed in early-stage colorectal cancer, is phosphorylated at Thr 58 by AMPK under hypoxia; this phosphorylation promotes PTPS binding to LTBP1 and subsequently drives iNOS-mediated LTBP1 S-nitrosylation through proximal-coupling BH4 production within the PTPS/iNOS/LTBP1 complex. In turn, LTBP1 S-nitrosylation results in proteasome-dependent LTBP1 protein degradation, revealing an inverse relationship between PTPS pT58 and LTBP1 stability. Physiologically, the repressive effect of PTPS on LTBP1 leads to impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and thereby maintains tumor cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LTBP1-TGF-β signaling by the BH4-biosynthesis pathway and highlight the specific requirement of PTPS for tumor growth."	1
"31995760"	"Domain Model Explains Propagation Dynamics and Stability of Histone H3K27 and H3K36 Methylation Landscapes.Chromatin states must be maintained during cell proliferation to uphold cellular identity and genome integrity. Inheritance of histone modifications is central in this process. However, the histone modification landscape is challenged by incorporation of new unmodified histones during each cell cycle, and the principles governing heritability remain unclear. We take a quantitative computational modeling approach to describe propagation of histone H3K27 and H3K36 methylation states. We measure combinatorial H3K27 and H3K36 methylation patterns by quantitative mass spectrometry on subsequent generations of histones. Using model comparison, we reject active global demethylation and invoke the existence of domains defined by distinct methylation endpoints. We find that H3K27me3 on pre-existing histones stimulates the rate of de novo H3K27me3 establishment, supporting a read-write mechanism in timely chromatin restoration. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative picture of the mutual antagonism between H3K27 and H3K36 methylation and propose that it stabilizes epigenetic states across cell division."	0
"31708417"	"ATR Protects the Genome against R Loops through a MUS81-Triggered Feedback Loop.R loops arising during transcription induce genomic instability, but how cells respond to the R loop-associated genomic stress is still poorly understood. Here, we show that cells harboring high levels of R loops rely on the ATR kinase for survival. In response to aberrant R loop accumulation, the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 pathway is activated by R loop-induced reversed replication forks. In contrast to the activation of ATR by replication inhibitors, R loop-induced ATR activation requires the MUS81 endonuclease. ATR protects the genome from R loops by suppressing transcription-replication collisions, promoting replication fork recovery, and enforcing a G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, ATR prevents excessive cleavage of reversed forks by MUS81, revealing a MUS81-triggered and ATR-mediated feedback loop that fine-tunes MUS81 activity at replication forks. These results suggest that ATR is a key sensor and suppressor of R loop-induced genomic instability, uncovering a signaling circuitry that safeguards the genome against R loops."	1

While KynA is generated locally within the nervous system, its precursor, kynurenine (Kyn), is largely derived from peripheral resources. The mechanisms that import Kyn into the nervous system are poorly understood.

"32726624"	"An Apoptotic Caspase Network Safeguards Cell Death Induction in Pyroptotic Macrophages.Pyroptosis has emerged as a key mechanism by which inflammasomes promote host defense against microbial pathogens and sterile inflammation. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated cell lysis is a hallmark of pyroptosis, but our understanding of cell death signaling during pyroptosis is fragmented. Here, we show that independently of GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization, inflammasome receptors engage caspase-1 and caspase-8, both of which redundantly promote activation of apoptotic executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 in pyroptotic macrophages. Impaired GSDMD pore formation downstream of caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation suffices to unmask the apoptotic phenotype of pyroptotic macrophages. Combined inactivation of initiator caspase-1 and caspase-8, or executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, is required to abolish inflammasome-induced DEVDase activity during pyroptosis and in apoptotic Gsdmd<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Collectively, these results unveil a robust apoptotic caspase network that is activated in parallel to GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization and safeguards cell death induction in pyroptotic macrophages."	1
"32320660"	"The Asymmetric Expression of SAUR Genes Mediated by ARF7/19 Promotes the Gravitropism and Phototropism of Plant Hypocotyls.The asymmetric distribution of auxin leads to the bending growth of hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, but the signaling events downstream of auxin remain unclear. Here, we identify many SAUR genes showing asymmetric expression in soybean hypocotyls during gravistimulation and then study their homologs in Arabidopsis. SAUR19 subfamily genes have asymmetric expression in Arabidopsis hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, induced by the lateral redistribution of auxin. Both the mutation of SAUR19 subfamily genes and the ectopic expression of SAUR19 weaken these tropic responses, indicating the critical role of their asymmetric expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor ARF7 may directly bind the SAUR19 promoter and activate SAUR19 expression asymmetrically in tropic responses. Taken together, our results reveal that a gravity- or light-triggered asymmetric auxin distribution induces the asymmetric expression of SAUR19 subfamily genes by ARF7 and ARF19 in the hypocotyls, which leads to bending growth during gravitropic and phototropic responses."	1

Reduced expression of PDX1 is thought to contribute to β-cell loss and dysfunction in diabetes. Thus, promoting PDX1 expression can be an effective strategy to preserve β-cell mass and function. Previously, we established a <i>PDX1</i> promoter-dependent luciferase system to screen agents that can promote PDX1 expression. Natural compound tectorigenin (TG) was identified as a promising candidate that could enhance the activity of the promoter for the <i>PDX1</i> gene. In this study, we first demonstrated that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in β-cells via activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of ERK; this effect was observed under either normal or glucotoxic/lipotoxic conditions. We then found that TG could suppress induced apoptosis and improved the viability of β-cells under glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by activation of ERK and reduction of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects held true <i>in vivo</i> as well: prophylactic or therapeutic use of TG could obviously inhibit ER stress and decrease islet β-cell apoptosis in the pancreas of mice given a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD), thus dramatically maintaining or restoring β-cell mass and islet size, respectively. Accordingly, both prophylactic and therapeutic use of TG improved HFHSD-impaired glucose metabolism in mice, as evidenced by ameliorating hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Taken together, TG, as an agent promoting PDX1 expression exhibits strong protective effects on islet β-cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."	1
"31003868"	"tRNA Maturation Defects Lead to Inhibition of rRNA Processing via Synthesis of pppGpp.rRNAs and tRNAs universally require processing from longer primary transcripts to become functional for translation. Here, we describe an unsuspected link between tRNA maturation and the 3' processing of 16S rRNA, a key step in preparing the small ribosomal subunit for interaction with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotic translation initiation. We show that an accumulation of either 5' or 3' immature tRNAs triggers RelA-dependent production of the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The accumulation of (p)ppGpp and accompanying decrease in GTP levels specifically inhibit 16S rRNA 3' maturation. We suggest that cells can exploit this mechanism to sense potential slowdowns in tRNA maturation and adjust rRNA processing accordingly to maintain the appropriate functional balance between these two major components of the translation apparatus."	0

Here, we identify a microRNA, miR-181a, and a molecular mechanism that simultaneously regulate the acquisition of DC-SIGN expression and the activation state of DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> mo-DCs. Specifically, we show that miR-181a promotes DC-SIGN expression during terminal mo-DC differentiation and limits its sensitivity and responsiveness to TLR triggering and CD40 ligation. Mechanistically, miR-181a sustains ERK-MAPK signaling in mo-DCs, thereby enabling the maintenance of high levels of DC-SIGN and a high activation threshold. Low miR-181a levels during mo-DC differentiation, induced by inflammatory signals, do not support the high phospho-ERK signal transduction required for DC-SIGN<sup>hi</sup> mo-DCs and lead to development of proinflammatory DC-SIGN<sup>lo/-</sup> mo-DCs. Collectively, our study demonstrates that high DC-SIGN expression levels and a high activation threshold in mo-DCs are linked and simultaneously maintained by miR-181a."	1

"32101734"	"Predicting Successful Generation and Inhibition of Seizure-like Afterdischarges and Mapping Their Seizure Networks Using fMRI.To understand the conditions necessary to initiate and terminate seizures, we investigate optogenetically induced hippocampal seizures with LFP, fMRI, and optogenetic inhibition. During afterdischarge induction using optogenetics, LFP recordings show that stimulations with earlier ictal onset times are more likely to result in afterdischarges and are more difficult to curtail with optogenetic inhibition. These results are generalizable across two initiation sites, the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. fMRI shows that afterdischarges initiated from the dorsal or ventral hippocampus exhibit distinct networks. Short-duration seizures initiated in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus are unilateral and bilateral, respectively, while longer-duration afterdischarges recruit broader, bilateral networks. When optogenetic inhibition is ineffective at stopping seizures, the network activity spreads more extensively but largely overlaps with the network activity associated with seizures that could be curtailed. These results provide insights into how seizures can be inhibited, which has implications for targeted seizure interventions."	0
"32726633"	"NMDAR-Dependent Emergence of Behavioral Representation in Primary Visual Cortex.Although neocortical sensory areas are generally thought to faithfully represent external stimuli, cortical networks exhibit considerable functional plasticity, allowing them to modify their output to reflect ongoing behavioral demands. We apply longitudinal 2-photon imaging of activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice learning a conditioned eyeblink task to investigate the dynamic representations of task-relevant information. We find that, although all V1 neurons robustly and stably encode visual input, pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons exhibit experience-dependent emergence of accurate behavioral representations during learning. The functional plasticity driving performance-predictive activity requires cell-autonomous expression of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Our findings demonstrate that accurate encoding of behavioral output is not inherent to V1 but develops during learning to support visual task performance."	0

However, it remains unclear how the hippocampus and RSC communicate and the role of ripple oscillation in coordinating the activity between these two brain regions. Here, we record from the dorsal hippocampus and RSC simultaneously in freely behaving mice during sleep and reveal that the RSC displays a pre-ripple activation associated with slow and fast oscillations. Immediately after ripples, a subpopulation of RSC putative inhibitory neurons increases firing activity, while most RSC putative excitatory neurons decrease activity. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of this hippocampus-RSC pathway activates and suppresses RSC putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively. These results suggest that the dorsal hippocampus mainly inhibits RSC activity via its direct innervation of RSC inhibitory neurons, which overshadows the RSC in supporting learning and memory functions."	0

Although LSD1 and JmjC domain-containing proteins have been identified as histone demethylases, enzymes for many histone methylation states or sites are still unknown. Here, we perform a screening of a cDNA library containing 2,500 nuclear proteins and identify hHR23A as a histone H4K20 demethylase. Overexpression of hHR23A reduces the levels of H4K20me1/2/3 in cells. In vitro, hHR23A specifically demethylates H4K20me1/2/3 and generates formaldehyde. The enzymatic activity requires Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate as cofactors and the UBA domains of hHR23A. hHR23B, a protein homologous to hHR23A, also demethylates H4K20me1/2/3 in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that hHR23A/B activate the transcription of coding genes by demethylating H4K20me1 and the transcription of repetitive elements by demethylating H4K20me3. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses demonstrate that an HxxxE motif in the UBA1 domain is crucial for iron binding and demethylase activity. Thus, we identify two hHR23 proteins as histone demethylases."	1

Zscan4 is transiently expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in preimplantation embryos and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming. However, little is known about the mechanism of Zscan4 underlying these processes of cell fate control.

The Zscan4f-Tet2 interaction promotes DNA demethylation and regulates the expression of target genes, particularly those encoding glycolytic enzymes and proteasome subunits. Zscan4f regulates metabolic rewiring, enhances proteasome function, and ultimately promotes iPSC generation. These results identify Zscan4f as an important partner of Tet2 in regulating target genes and promoting iPSC generation and suggest a possible and common mechanism shared by SCAN family transcription factors to recruit ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases to regulate diverse cellular processes, including reprogramming."	1

Previous work has shown that these collapsed forks relocalize to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in late S phase in a manner dependent on replication, the nucleoporin Nup84, and the Slx5 protein, which prevents repeat fragility and instability. Here, we show that binding of the Smc5/6 complex to the collapsed fork triggers Mms21-dependent sumoylation of fork-associated DNA repair proteins, and that RPA, Rad52, and Rad59 are the key sumoylation targets that mediate relocation. The SUMO interacting motifs of Slx5 target collapsed forks to the NPC. Notably, Rad51 foci only co-localize with the repeat after it is anchored to the nuclear periphery and Rad51 exclusion from the early collapsed fork is dependent on RPA sumoylation. This pathway may provide a mechanism to constrain recombination at stalled or collapsed forks until it is required for fork restart."	0

Our recent data show that SAG/RBX2/ROC2, a RING component of Cullin-RING E3 ligase, also complexes with these E2s for K11-linked substrate polyubiquitylation. Whether these two E3s cross-talk with each other was previously unknown. Here, we report that SAG competes with APC2 for UBE2C/UBE2S binding to act as a potential endogenous inhibitor of APC/C, thereby regulating the G2-to-M progression. As such, SAG knockdown triggers premature activation of APC/C, leading to mitotic slippage and resistance to anti-microtubule drugs. On the other hand, SAG itself is a substrate of APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup> for targeted degradation at the G1 phase. The degradation-resistant mutant of SAG-R98A/L101A accelerates the G1-to-S progression.

"32679077"	"Acetylation-Dependent Deubiquitinase OTUD3 Controls MAVS Activation in Innate Antiviral Immunity.Accurate regulation of innate immunity is necessary for the host to efficiently respond to invading pathogens and avoid excessive harmful immune pathology. Here we identified OTUD3 as an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinase that restricts innate antiviral immune signaling. OTUD3 deficiency in mice results in enhanced innate immunity, a diminished viral load, and morbidity. OTUD3 directly hydrolyzes lysine 63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and thus shuts off innate antiviral immune response. Notably, the catalytic activity of OTUD3 relies on acetylation of its Lys129 residue. In response to virus infection, the acetylated Lys129 is removed by SIRT1, which promptly inactivates OTUD3 and thus allows timely induction of innate antiviral immunity. Importantly, acetyl-OTUD3 levels are inversely correlated with IFN-β expression in influenza patients. These findings establish OTUD3 as a repressor of MAVS and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the catalytic activity of OTUD3 is tightly controlled to ensure timely activation of antiviral defense."	1
"32234472"	"Targeting the Extrinsic Pathway of Hepatocyte Apoptosis Promotes Clearance of Plasmodium Liver Infection.Plasmodium sporozoites infect the liver and develop into exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate blood-stage disease. The hepatocyte molecular pathways that permit or abrogate parasite replication and merozoite formation have not been thoroughly explored, and a deeper understanding may identify therapeutic strategies to mitigate malaria. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins regulate cell survival and are co-opted by intracellular pathogens to support development. Here, we show that cIAP1 levels are upregulated during Plasmodium liver infection and that genetic or pharmacological targeting of cIAPs using clinical-stage antagonists preferentially kills infected hepatocytes and promotes immunity. Using gene-targeted mice, the mechanism was defined as TNF-TNFR1-mediated apoptosis via caspases 3 and 8 to clear parasites. This study reveals the importance of cIAPs to Plasmodium infection and demonstrates that host-directed antimalarial drugs can eliminate liver parasites and induce immunity while likely providing a high barrier to resistance in the parasite."	0
"32616520"	"Identification of a localized nonsense-mediated decay pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum.Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a translation-dependent RNA quality control mechanism that occurs in the cytoplasm. However, it is unknown how NMD regulates the stability of RNAs translated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we identify a localized NMD pathway dedicated to ER-translated mRNAs. We previously identified NBAS, a component of the Syntaxin 18 complex involved in Golgi-to-ER trafficking, as a novel NMD factor. Furthermore, we show that NBAS fulfills an independent function in NMD. This ER-NMD pathway requires the interaction of NBAS with the core NMD factor UPF1, which is partially localized at the ER in the proximity of the translocon. NBAS and UPF1 coregulate the stability of ER-associated transcripts, in particular those associated with the cellular stress response. We propose a model where NBAS recruits UPF1 to the membrane of the ER and activates an ER-dedicated NMD pathway, thus providing an ER-protective function by ensuring quality control of ER-translated mRNAs."	1
"32433963"	"Zinc Finger RNA-Binding Protein Zn72D Regulates ADAR-Mediated RNA Editing in Neurons.Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, alters RNA sequences from those encoded by DNA. These editing events are dynamically regulated, but few trans regulators of ADARs are known in vivo. Here, we screen RNA-binding proteins for roles in editing regulation with knockdown experiments in the Drosophila brain. We identify zinc-finger protein at 72D (Zn72D) as a regulator of editing levels at a majority of editing sites in the brain. Zn72D both regulates ADAR protein levels and interacts with ADAR in an RNA-dependent fashion, and similar to ADAR, Zn72D is necessary to maintain proper neuromuscular junction architecture and fly mobility. Furthermore, Zn72D's regulatory role in RNA editing is conserved because the mammalian homolog of Zn72D, Zfr, regulates editing in mouse primary neurons. The broad and conserved regulation of ADAR editing by Zn72D in neurons sustains critically important editing events."	0
"32726616"	"PHF7 Modulates BRDT Stability and Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis.Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system."	1

During translation surveillance, endonucleolytic cleavage of the problematic mRNA is a critical step in rescuing stalled ribosomes. Here we identify NONU-1 as a factor required for translation surveillance pathways including no-go and nonstop mRNA decay. We show that (1) NONU-1 reduces nonstop and no-go mRNA levels; (2) NONU-1 contains an Smr RNase domain required for mRNA decay; (3) the domain architecture and catalytic residues of NONU-1 are conserved throughout metazoans and eukaryotes, respectively; and (4) NONU-1 is required for the formation of mRNA cleavage fragments in the vicinity of stalled ribosomes. We extend our results in C. elegans to homologous factors in S. cerevisiae, showing the evolutionarily conserved function of NONU-1. Our work establishes the identity of a factor critical to translation surveillance and will inform mechanistic studies at the intersection of translation and mRNA decay."	0
"32640233"	"Theta Oscillations Coincide with Sustained Hyperpolarization in CA3 Pyramidal Cells, Underlying Decreased Firing.Brain states modulate the membrane potential dynamics of neurons, influencing the functional repertoire of the network. Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, which preferentially occurs during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and a reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta, as observed in ensemble recordings."	0
"31630969"	"An Early mtUPR: Redistribution of the Nuclear Transcription Factor Rox1 to Mitochondria Protects against Intramitochondrial Proteotoxic Aggregates.The mitochondrial proteome is built mainly by import of nuclear-encoded precursors, which are targeted mostly by cleavable presequences. Presequence processing upon import is essential for proteostasis and survival, but the consequences of dysfunctional protein maturation are unknown. We find that impaired presequence processing causes accumulation of precursors inside mitochondria that form aggregates, which escape degradation and unexpectedly do not cause cell death. Instead, cells survive via activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-like pathway that is triggered very early after precursor accumulation. In contrast to classical stress pathways, this immediate response maintains mitochondrial protein import, membrane potential, and translation through translocation of the nuclear HMG-box transcription factor Rox1 to mitochondria. Rox1 binds mtDNA and performs a TFAM-like function pivotal for transcription and translation. Induction of early mtUPR provides a reversible stress model to mechanistically dissect the initial steps in mtUPR pathways with the stressTFAM Rox1 as the first line of defense."	0
"32467227"	"Combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency activates expression of mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1) required for growth of triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer subtype for which effective therapies are unavailable. TNBC has a high frequency of tumor protein p53 (Tp53/p53)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiencies, and combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency is associated with poor prognosis and poor response to anticancer therapies. In this study, we discovered that combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency in TNBC activates expression of the transcription factor mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1). We found that MEOX1 is expressed only in TNBC cells with frequent deficiencies in p53 and PTEN, and that its expression is undetectable in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2+ subtypes, as well as in normal breast cells with wild-type (WT) p53 and PTEN. Notably, siRNA knockdown of both p53 and PTEN activated MEOX1 expression in breast cancer cells, whereas individual knockdowns of either p53 or PTEN had only minimal effects on MEOX1 expression. MEOX1 knockdown abolished cell proliferation of p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC <i>in vitro</i> and inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>, but had no effect on the proliferation of luminal and HER2+ cancer cells and normal breast cells. RNA-Seq and immunoblotting analyses showed that MEOX1 knockdown decreased expression of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B), and STAT6 in p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC cells. These results reveal the effects of combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency on MEOX1 expression and TNBC cell proliferation, suggesting that MEOX1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC."	0
"30879903"	"MDM2 Integrates Cellular Respiration and Apoptotic Signaling through NDUFS1 and the Mitochondrial Network.Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2."	1

"32075754"	"Sen1 Is Recruited to Replication Forks via Ctf4 and Mrc1 and Promotes Genome Stability.DNA replication and RNA transcription compete for the same substrate during S phase. Cells have evolved several mechanisms to minimize such conflicts. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the transcription termination helicase Sen1 associates with replisomes. We show that the N terminus of Sen1 is both sufficient and necessary for replisome association and that it binds to the replisome via the components Ctf4 and Mrc1. We generated a separation of function mutant, sen1-3, which abolishes replisome binding without affecting transcription termination. We observe that the sen1-3 mutants show increased genome instability and recombination levels. Moreover, sen1-3 is synthetically defective with mutations in genes involved in RNA metabolism and the S phase checkpoint. RNH1 overexpression suppresses defects in the former, but not the latter. These findings illustrate how Sen1 plays a key function at replication forks during DNA replication to promote fork progression and chromosome stability."	1
"32846130"	"BIRC2 Expression Impairs Anti-Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy Efficacy.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has led to therapeutic responses in some cancer patients for whom no effective treatment previously existed. ICB acts on T lymphocytes and other immune cells that are inactivated due to checkpoint signals that inhibit their infiltration and function within tumors. But for more than 80% of patients, immunotherapy has not been effective. Here, we demonstrate a cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to ICB mediated by baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2). Knockdown of BIRC2 expression in mouse melanoma or breast cancer cells increases expression of the chemokine CXCL9 and impairs tumor growth by increasing the number of intratumoral activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells. Administration of anti-CXCL9 neutralizing antibody inhibits the recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells to BIRC2-deficient tumors. Most importantly, BIRC2 deficiency dramatically increases the sensitivity of mouse melanoma and breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD1 ICB."	1
"32580944"	"Negatively charged amino acids in the stalk region of membrane proteins reduce ectodomain shedding.Ectodomain shedding is a post-translational modification mechanism by which the entire extracellular domain of membrane proteins is liberated through juxtamembrane processing. Because shedding rapidly and irreversibly alters the characteristics of cells, this process is properly regulated. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the propensity of membrane proteins to shedding are largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that negatively charged amino acids within the stalk region, an unstructured juxtamembrane region at which shedding occurs, contribute to shedding susceptibility. We show that two <u>a</u>ctivated <u>leukocyte c</u>ell <u>a</u>dhesion <u>m</u>olecule (ALCAM) protein variants produced by alternative splicing have different susceptibilities to ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated shedding. Of note, the inclusion of a stalk region encoded by a 39-bp-long alternative exon conferred shedding resistance. We found that this alternative exon encodes a large proportion of negatively charged amino acids, which we demonstrate are indispensable for conferring the shedding resistance. We also show that the introduction of negatively charged amino acids into the stalk region of shedding-susceptible ALCAM variant protein attenuates its shedding. Furthermore, we observed that negatively charged amino acids residing in the stalk region of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) are indispensable for its shedding resistance. Collectively, our results indicate that negatively charged amino acids within the stalk region interfere with the shedding of multiple membrane proteins. We conclude that the composition of the stalk region determines the shedding susceptibility of membrane proteins."	0

However, the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate Tfh differentiation are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the frequencies of Tfhs and GC B cells, as well as interleukin-21 (IL-21) and anti-ovalbumin (OVA) antibodies, are markedly decreased in forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) knockout mice immunized with OVA. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras and lymphocyte-repopulated Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice proves that wild-type (WT), but not Foxo3-deficient T cells provoke GC B cell maturation and antibody production. Deficiency of Foxo3 inhibits inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)-induced Tfh differentiation.

In conclusion, our study unveils a critical role of Foxo3 in the regulation of Tfh differentiation and IL-21 production. Modulating Foxo3 activity may be beneficial for enhancing or preventing antibody-mediated immune responses."	1

Here, we show that a lncRNA, MORRBID, a selective transcriptional repressor of BIM, is overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is associated with poor overall survival. In both human and animal models, MORRBID hyperactivation correlates with two recurrent AML drivers, TET2 and FLT3<sup>ITD</sup>. Mice with individual mutations of Tet2 or Flt3<sup>ITD</sup> develop features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), respectively, and combined presence results in AML. We observe increased levels of Morrbid in murine models of CMML, MPN, and AML. Functionally, loss of Morrbid in these models induces increased expression of Bim and cell death in immature and mature myeloid cells, which results in reduced infiltration of leukemic cells in tissues and prolongs the survival of AML mice."	0

We screened diverse TFs for binding to nucleosomes containing motif-enriched sequences targeted by pioneer factors in vivo. FOXA1, OCT4, ASCL1/E12α, PU1, CEBPα, and ZELDA display a range of nucleosome binding affinities that correlate with their cell reprogramming potential. We further screened 593 full-length human TFs on protein microarrays against different nucleosome sequences, followed by confirmation in solution, to distinguish among factors that bound nucleosomes, such as the neuronal AP-2α/β/γ, versus factors that only bound free DNA. Structural comparisons of DNA binding domains revealed that efficient nucleosome binders use short anchoring α helices to bind DNA, whereas weak nucleosome binders use unstructured regions and/or β sheets. Thus, specific modes of DNA interaction allow nucleosome scanning that confers pioneer activity to transcription factors."	0
"31561952"	"Heat Shock Factor 1 Is a Direct Antagonist of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase.Through transcriptional control of the evolutionarily conserved heat shock, or proteotoxic stress, response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) preserves proteomic stability. Here, we show that HSF1, a physiological substrate for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), constitutively suppresses this central metabolic sensor. By physically evoking conformational switching of AMPK, HSF1 impairs AMP binding to the γ subunits and enhances the PP2A-mediated de-phosphorylation, but it impedes the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr172, and retards ATP binding to the catalytic α subunits. These immediate and manifold regulations empower HSF1 to both repress AMPK under basal conditions and restrain its activation by diverse stimuli, thereby promoting lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and protein cholesteroylation. In vivo, HSF1 antagonizes AMPK to control body fat mass and drive the lipogenic phenotype and growth of melanomas independently of its intrinsic transcriptional action. Thus, the physical AMPK-HSF1 interaction epitomizes a reciprocal kinase-substrate regulation whereby lipid metabolism and proteomic stability intertwine."	1

However, the specific functional roles that Caspr2 plays in the central nervous system and their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report on a functional role for Caspr2 in the developing cerebellum. Using a combination of confocal microscopy, biochemical analyses, and behavioral testing, we show that loss of Caspr2 in the <i>Cntnap2</i><sup>-/-</sup> knockout mouse results in impaired Purkinje cell dendritic development, altered intracellular signaling, and motor coordination deficits. We also find that Caspr2 is highly enriched at synaptic specializations in the cerebellum. Using a proteomics approach, we identify type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R1) as a specific synaptic interaction partner of the Caspr2 extracellular domain in the molecular layer of the developing cerebellum. The interaction of the Caspr2 extracellular domain with IP<sub>3</sub>R1 inhibits IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Together, our work defines a mechanism by which Caspr2 controls the development and function of the cerebellum and advances our understanding of how Caspr2 dysfunction might lead to specific brain disorders."	1

Inflammasome-activated caspases are known to cleave cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Here, we found that apoptotic caspases are critically involved in regulating both DNA and RNA virus-triggered host defenses, in which activated caspase-3 cleaved cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 to prevent cytokine overproduction. Caspase-3 was exclusively required in human cells, whereas caspase-7 was involved only in murine cells to inactivate cGAS, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. Caspase-mediated cGAS cleavage was enhanced in the presence of dsDNA. Alternative MAVS cleavage sites were used to ensure the inactivation of this critical protein. Elevated type I IFNs were detected in caspase-3-deficient cells without any infection. Casp3<sup>-/-</sup> mice consistently showed increased resistance to viral infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic caspases control innate immunity and maintain immune homeostasis against viral infection."	1
"32763910"	"miR760 regulates ATXN1 levels via interaction with its 5' untranslated region.Identifying modifiers of dosage-sensitive genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders is imperative to discover novel genetic risk factors and potential therapeutic entry points. In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (<i>ATXN1</i>), a dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate <i>ATXN1</i> expression remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that <i>ATXN1</i>'s unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator that binds to a conserved site in <i>ATXN1</i>'s 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the possibility that noncoding mutations in the <i>ATXN1</i> locus may act as risk factors for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias."	1
"31914389"	"STCH4/REIL2 Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Arabidopsis by Promoting rRNA Processing and CBF Protein Translation.Plants respond to cold stress by inducing the expression of transcription factors that regulate downstream genes to confer tolerance to freezing. We screened an Arabidopsis transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion library and identified a cold-hypersensitive mutant, which we named stch4 (sensitive to chilling 4). STCH4/REIL2 encodes a ribosomal biogenesis factor that is upregulated upon cold stress. Overexpression of STCH4 confers chilling and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. The stch4 mutation reduces CBF protein levels and thus delayed the induction of C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) regulon genes. Ribosomal RNA processing is reduced in stch4 mutants, especially under cold stress. STCH4 associates with multiple ribosomal proteins, and these interactions are modulated by cold stress. These results suggest that the ribosome is a regulatory node for cold stress responses and that STCH4 promotes an altered ribosomal composition and functions in low temperatures to facilitate the translation of proteins important for plant growth and survival under cold stress."	1

Yet the roles of core autophagy proteins in IBM and stress granule dynamics remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that disrupted expression of the core autophagy proteins ULK1 and ULK2 in mice causes a vacuolar myopathy with ubiquitin and TDP-43-positive inclusions; this myopathy is similar to that caused by VCP/p97 mutations, the most common cause of familial IBM. Mechanistically, we show that ULK1/2 localize to stress granules and phosphorylate VCP, thereby increasing VCP's activity and ability to disassemble stress granules. These data suggest that VCP dysregulation and defective stress granule disassembly contribute to IBM-like disease in Ulk1/2-deficient mice. In addition, stress granule disassembly is accelerated by an ULK1/2 agonist, suggesting ULK1/2 as targets for exploiting the higher-order regulation of stress granules for therapeutic intervention of IBM and related disorders."	1

NF2 is a well-established tumor suppressor, and loss of NF2 severely compromises Hippo pathway activity. However, the precise mechanism of how NF2 mediates upstream signals to regulate the Hippo pathway is not clear. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, NF2's lipid-binding ability is critical for its function in activating the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress. Mechanistically, osmotic stress induces PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plasma membrane enrichment by activating the PIP5K family, allowing for NF2 plasma membrane recruitment and subsequent downstream Hippo pathway activation. An NF2 mutant deficient in lipid binding is unable to activate the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress, as measured by LATS and YAP phosphorylation.

However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival.

Here, we analyzed the degradation pathways of two short-lived ER membrane model proteins in mammalian cells. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide library screen, we identified an ERAD branch required for quality control of a subset of membrane proteins. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches, we showed that this ERAD branch is defined by an ER membrane complex consisting of the ubiquitin ligase RNF185, the ubiquitin-like domain containing proteins TMUB1/2 and TMEM259/Membralin, a poorly characterized protein. This complex cooperates with cytosolic ubiquitin ligase UBE3C and p97 ATPase in degrading their membrane substrates.

"31805522"	"Fork pausing complex engages topoisomerases at the replisome.Replication forks temporarily or terminally pause at hundreds of hard-to-replicate regions around the genome. A conserved pair of budding yeast replisome components Tof1-Csm3 (fission yeast Swi1-Swi3 and human TIMELESS-TIPIN) act as a ""molecular brake"" and promote fork slowdown at proteinaceous replication fork barriers (RFBs), while the accessory helicase Rrm3 assists the replisome in removing protein obstacles. Here we show that the Tof1-Csm3 complex promotes fork pausing independently of Rrm3 helicase by recruiting topoisomerase I (Top1) to the replisome. Topoisomerase II (Top2) partially compensates for the pausing decrease in cells when Top1 is lost from the replisome. The C terminus of Tof1 is specifically required for Top1 recruitment to the replisome and fork pausing but not for DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) activation. We propose that forks pause at proteinaceous RFBs through a ""sTOP"" mechanism (""slowing down with topoisomerases I-II""), which we show also contributes to protecting cells from topoisomerase-blocking agents."	0

However, how PGC-1α is regulated in response to oxygen availability remains unclear. We demonstrated that lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) binds to PGC-1α and demethylates monomethylated lysine (K) 224 of PGC-1α under normoxic conditions. Hypoxic stimulation inhibits KDM3A, which has a high K<sub>M</sub> of oxygen for its activity, and enhances PGC-1α K224 monomethylation. This modification decreases PGC-1α's activity required for NRF1- and NRF2-dependent transcriptional regulation of TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M, resulting in reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. Expression of PGC-1α K224R mutant significantly increases mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and tumor cell apoptosis under hypoxia and inhibits brain tumor growth in mice. This study revealed that PGC-1α monomethylation, which is dependent on oxygen availability-regulated KDM3A, plays a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis."	1
"30824372"	"P-TEFb Activation by RBM7 Shapes a Pro-survival Transcriptional Response to Genotoxic Stress.DNA damage response (DDR) involves dramatic transcriptional alterations, the mechanisms of which remain ill defined. Here, we show that following genotoxic stress, the RNA-binding motif protein 7 (RBM7) stimulates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription and promotes cell viability by activating the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) via its release from the inhibitory 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP). This is mediated by activation of p38<sup>MAPK</sup>, which triggers enhanced binding of RBM7 with core subunits of 7SK snRNP. In turn, P-TEFb relocates to chromatin to induce transcription of short units, including key DDR genes and multiple classes of non-coding RNAs. Critically, interfering with the axis of RBM7 and P-TEFb provokes cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-damage-inducing agents due to activation of apoptosis. Our work uncovers the importance of stress-dependent stimulation of Pol II pause release, which enables a pro-survival transcriptional response that is crucial for cell fate upon genotoxic insult."	1
"32521274"	"Slow Receptor Binding of the Noncytopathic HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs Is Balanced by Long-Lived Activation State and Efficient Fusion Activity.Many HIV strains downregulate the levels of CD4 receptor on the surface of infected cells to prevent superinfection. In contrast, the rare HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> strain is noncytopathic and has no effect on CD4 expression in infected cells but still replicates as efficiently as more cytopathic strains in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we show that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Env interactions with the CD4 receptor exhibit slow association kinetics, whereas the dissociation kinetics is within the range of cytopathic strains. Despite the resulting 10- to 100-fold decrease in binding affinity, HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs exhibit long-lived activation state and efficient fusion activity. These observations suggest that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs evolved to balance low affinity with an improved and readily triggerable molecular machinery to mediate entry. Resistance to cold exposure, similar to many primary HIV-1 isolates, and to sCD4 neutralization suggests that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs preferentially sample a closed Env conformation. Our data provide insights into the mechanism of HIV entry."	0
"31324450"	"Multidomain Convergence of Argonaute during RISC Assembly Correlates with the Formation of Internal Water Clusters.Despite the relevance of Argonaute proteins in RNA silencing, little is known about the structural steps of small RNA loading to form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). We report the 1.9 Å crystal structure of human Argonaute4 with guide RNA. Comparison with the previously determined apo structure of Neurospora crassa QDE2 revealed that the PIWI domain has two subdomains. Binding of guide RNA fastens the subdomains, thereby rearranging the active-site residues and increasing the affinity for TNRC6 proteins. We also identified two water pockets beneath the nucleic acid-binding channel that appeared to stabilize the mature RISC. Indeed, mutating the water-pocket residues of Argonaute2 and Argonaute4 compromised RISC assembly. Simulations predict that internal water molecules are exchangeable with the bulk solvent but always occupy specific positions at the domain interfaces. These results suggest that after guide RNA-driven conformational changes, water-mediated hydrogen-bonding networks tie together the converged domains to complete the functional RISC structure."	0
"32698007"	"Degradation of Non-coding RNAs Promotes Recycling of Termination Factors at Sites of Transcription.A large share of the non-coding transcriptome in yeast is controlled by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which promotes transcription termination of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and by the nuclear exosome, which limits the steady-state levels of the transcripts produced. How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation."	0
"31542297"	"Glutarylation of Histone H4 Lysine 91 Regulates Chromatin Dynamics.Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure and dynamics during various DNA-associated processes. Here, we report that lysine glutarylation (Kglu) occurs at 27 lysine residues on human core histones. Using semi-synthetic glutarylated histones, we show that an evolutionarily conserved Kglu at histone H4K91 destabilizes nucleosome in vitro. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replacement of H4K91 by glutamate that mimics Kglu influences chromatin structure and thereby results in a global upregulation of transcription and defects in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and telomere silencing. In mammalian cells, H4K91glu is mainly enriched at promoter regions of highly expressed genes. A downregulation of H4K91glu is tightly associated with chromatin condensation during mitosis and in response to DNA damage. The cellular dynamics of H4K91glu is controlled by Sirt7 as a deglutarylase and KAT2A as a glutaryltransferase. This study designates a new histone mark (Kglu) as a new regulatory mechanism for chromatin dynamics."	1
"32101751"	"TIFAB Regulates USP15-Mediated p53 Signaling during Stressed and Malignant Hematopoiesis.TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain B (TIFAB) is implicated in myeloid malignancies with deletion of chromosome 5q. Employing a combination of proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that TIFAB regulates ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Expression of TIFAB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) permits USP15 signaling to substrates, including MDM2 and KEAP1, and mitigates p53 expression. Consequently, TIFAB-deficient HSPCs exhibit compromised USP15 signaling and are sensitized to hematopoietic stress by derepression of p53. In MLL-AF9 leukemia, deletion of TIFAB increases p53 signaling and correspondingly decreases leukemic cell function and development of leukemia. Restoring USP15 expression partially rescues the function of TIFAB-deficient MLL-AF9 cells. Conversely, elevated TIFAB represses p53, increases leukemic progenitor function, and correlates with MLL gene expression programs in leukemia patients. Our studies uncover a function of TIFAB as an effector of USP15 activity and rheostat of p53 signaling in stressed and malignant HSPCs."	1
"32209458"	"Multi-scale Predictions of Drug Resistance Epidemiology Identify Design Principles for Rational Drug Design.Rationally designing drugs that last longer in the face of biological evolution is a critical objective of drug discovery. However, this goal is thwarted by the diversity and stochasticity of evolutionary trajectories that drive uncertainty in the clinic. Although biophysical models can qualitatively predict whether a mutation causes resistance, they cannot quantitatively predict the relative abundance of resistance mutations in patient populations. We present stochastic, first-principle models that are parameterized on a large in vitro dataset and that accurately predict the epidemiological abundance of resistance mutations across multiple leukemia clinical trials. The ability to forecast resistance variants requires an understanding of their underlying mutation biases. Beyond leukemia, a meta-analysis across prostate cancer, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors suggests that resistance evolution in the adjuvant setting is influenced by mutational bias. Our analysis establishes a principle for rational drug design: when evolution favors the most probable mutant, so should drug design."	0

"32647014"	"Lysines in the lyase active site of DNA polymerase β destabilize nonspecific DNA binding, facilitating searching and DNA gap recognition.DNA polymerase (pol) β catalyzes two reactions at DNA gaps generated during base excision repair, gap-filling DNA synthesis and lyase-dependent 5´-end deoxyribose phosphate removal. The lyase domain of pol β has been proposed to function in DNA gap recognition and to facilitate DNA scanning during substrate search. However, the mechanisms and molecular interactions used by pol β for substrate search and recognition are not clear. To provide insight into this process, a comparison was made of the DNA binding affinities of WT pol β, pol λ, and pol μ, and several variants of pol β, for 1-nt-gap-containing and undamaged DNA. Surprisingly, this analysis revealed that mutation of three lysine residues in the lyase active site of pol β, 35, 68, and 72, to alanine (pol β KΔ3A) increased the binding affinity for nonspecific DNA ∼11-fold compared with that of the WT. WT pol μ, lacking homologous lysines, displayed nonspecific DNA binding behavior similar to that of pol β KΔ3A, in line with previous data demonstrating both enzymes were deficient in processive searching. In fluorescent microscopy experiments using mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1, the ability of pol β KΔ3A to localize to sites of laser-induced DNA damage was strongly decreased compared with that of WT pol β. These data suggest that the three lysines in the lyase active site destabilize pol β when bound to DNA nonspecifically, promoting DNA scanning and providing binding specificity for gapped DNA."	0
"32482893"	"A-kinase-anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1)-based signaling complexes coordinate local protein synthesis at the mitochondrial surface.Compartmentalization of macromolecules is a ubiquitous molecular mechanism that drives numerous cellular functions. The appropriate organization of enzymes in space and time enables the precise transmission and integration of intracellular signals. Molecular scaffolds constrain signaling enzymes to influence the regional modulation of these physiological processes. Mitochondrial targeting of protein kinases and protein phosphatases provides a means to locally control the phosphorylation status and action of proteins on the surface of this organelle. Dual-specificity protein kinase A anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1) is a multivalent binding protein that targets protein kinase A (PKA), RNAs, and other signaling enzymes to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Many AKAPs recruit a diverse set of binding partners that coordinate a broad range of cellular processes. Here, results of MS and biochemical analyses reveal that dAKAP1 anchors additional components, including the ribonucleoprotein granule components La-related protein 4 (LARP4) and polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1). Local translation of mRNAs at organelles is a means to spatially control the synthesis of proteins. RNA-Seq data demonstrate that dAKAP1 binds mRNAs encoding proteins required for mitochondrial metabolism, including succinate dehydrogenase. Functional studies suggest that the loss of dAKAP1-RNA interactions reduces mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. Hence, dAKAP1 plays a previously unappreciated role as a molecular interface between second messenger signaling and local protein synthesis machinery."	1

"32783940"	"FOXK1 Participates in DNA Damage Response by Controlling 53BP1 Function.53BP1 plays a central role in dictating DNA repair choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), which is important for the sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) of BRCA1-deficient cancers. In this study, we show that FOXK1 associates with 53BP1 and regulates 53BP1-dependent functions. FOXK1-53BP1 interaction is significantly enhanced upon DNA damage during the S phase in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner, which reduces the association of 53BP1 with its downstream factors RIF1 and PTIP. Depletion of FOXK1 impairs DNA repair and induces compromised cell survival upon DNA damage. Overexpression of FOXK1 diminishes 53BP1 foci formation, which leads to resistance to PARPis and elevation of HR in BRCA1-deficient cells and decreased telomere fusion in TRF2-depleted cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that FOXK1 negatively regulates 53BP1 function by inhibiting 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, which alters the DSB-induced protein complexes centering on 53BP1 and thus influences DNA repair choice."	1
"32647006"	"A kinase cascade on the yeast lysosomal vacuole regulates its membrane dynamics: conserved kinase Env7 is phosphorylated by casein kinase Yck3.Membrane fusion/fission is a highly dynamic and conserved process that responds to intra- and extracellular signals. Whereas the molecular machineries involved in membrane fusion/fission have been dissected, regulation of membrane dynamics remains poorly understood. The lysosomal vacuole of budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) has served as a seminal model in studies of membrane dynamics. We have previously established that yeast <i>ENV7</i> encodes an ortholog of STK16-related kinases that localizes to the vacuolar membrane and downregulates vacuolar membrane fusion. Additionally, we have previously reported that Env7 phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i> depends on <i>YCK3</i>, a gene that encodes a vacuolar membrane casein kinase I (CKI) homolog that nonredundantly functions in fusion regulation. Here, we report that Env7 physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by Yck3. We also establish that Env7 vacuole fusion/fission regulation and vacuolar localization are mediated through its Yck3-dependent phosphorylation. Through extensive site-directed mutagenesis, we map phosphorylation to the Env7 C terminus and confirm that Ser-331 is a primary and preferred phosphorylation site. Phospho-deficient Env7 mutants were defective in negative regulation of membrane fusion, increasing the number of prominent vacuoles, whereas a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-331 increased the number of fragmented vacuoles. Bioinformatics approaches confirmed that Env7 Ser-331 is within a motif that is highly conserved in STK16-related kinases and that it also anchors an SXXS CKI phosphorylation motif (<sub>328</sub>SRFS<sub>331</sub>). This study represents the first report on the regulatory mechanism of an STK16-related kinase. It also points to regulation of vacuolar membrane dynamics via a novel Yck3-Env7 kinase cascade."	1
"30595434"	"Noncanonical Modulation of the eIF2 Pathway Controls an Increase in Local Translation during Neural Wiring.Local translation is rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but its control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the extracellular cue Sema3A induces an initial burst in local translation that precisely controls phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α via the unfolded protein response (UPR) kinase PERK. Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers. Finally, we show that PERK signaling is needed for directional axon migration and visual pathway development in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a noncanonical eIF2 signaling pathway that controls selective changes in axon translation and is required for neural wiring."	1

The R-loop eraser RNase H can efficiently relax HO-TRCs. However, it is not clear how organisms resist HO-TRC-triggered R-loops when RNase H proteins are deficient. By screening factors that may relieve R-loop accumulation in the Arabidopsis atrnh1c mutant, we find that overexpression of the R-loop helicase RHON1 can rescue the defects of aberrantly accumulated HO-TRC-triggered R-loops co-transcriptionally. In addition, we find that RHON1 interacts with and orchestrates the transcriptional activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerases to release the conflicts between transcription and replication. Our study illustrates that organisms employ multiple mechanisms to escape HO-TRC-triggered R-loop accumulation and thus maintain genome integrity."	0
"32640226"	"MAP4K Interactome Reveals STRN4 as a Key STRIPAK Complex Component in Hippo Pathway Regulation.Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) constitute a mammalian STE20-like serine/threonine kinase subfamily. Recent studies provide substantial evidence for MAP4K family kinases in the Hippo pathway regulation, suggesting a broad role of MAP4Ks in human physiology and diseases. However, a comprehensive analysis of the regulators and effectors for this key kinase family has not been fully achieved. Using a proteomic approach, we define the protein-protein interaction network for human MAP4K family kinases and reveal diverse cellular signaling events involving this important kinase family. Through it, we identify a STRIPAK complex component, STRN4, as a generic binding partner for MAP4Ks and a key regulator of the Hippo pathway in endometrial cancer development. Taken together, the results of our study not only generate a rich resource for further characterizing human MAP4K family kinases in numerous biological processes but also dissect the STRIPAK-mediated regulation of MAP4Ks in the Hippo pathway."	0

Here we report structural and functional studies of human maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor suppressor lncRNA that modulates the p53 response. We found that, in an evolutionary conserved region of MEG3, two distal motifs interact by base complementarity to form alternative, mutually exclusive pseudoknot structures (""kissing loops"").

"32649882"	"Tandem Deubiquitination and Acetylation of SPRTN Promotes DNA-Protein Crosslink Repair and Protects against Aging.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that threaten genomic integrity. Recent findings highlight that SPRTN, a specialized DNA-dependent metalloprotease, is a central player in proteolytic cleavage of DPCs. Previous studies suggest that SPRTN deubiquitination is important for its chromatin association and activation. However, the regulation and consequences of SPRTN deubiquitination remain unclear. Here we report that, in response to DPC induction, the deubiquitinase VCPIP1/VCIP135 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM/ATR. VCPIP1, in turn, deubiquitinates SPRTN and promotes its chromatin relocalization. Deubiquitination of SPRTN is required for its subsequent acetylation, which promotes SPRTN relocation to the site of chromatin damage. Furthermore, Vcpip1 knockout mice are prone to genomic instability and premature aging. We propose a model where two sequential post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate SPRTN chromatin accessibility to repair DPCs and maintain genomic stability and a healthy lifespan."	1

Phosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A<sub>C</sub>) at tyrosine 307 has been claimed to inactivate PP2A and was examined in more than 180 studies using commercial antibodies, but this modification was never identified using mass spectrometry.

Furthermore, a thermo-sensor capable of sensing the small temperature differentials leading to temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in poikilothermic reptiles has not been identified. Here, we show that the activity of CDC-like kinases (CLKs) is highly responsive to physiological temperature changes, which is conferred by structural rearrangements within the kinase activation segment. Lower body temperature activates CLKs resulting in strongly increased phosphorylation of SR proteins in vitro and in vivo. This globally controls temperature-dependent alternative splicing and gene expression, with wide implications in circadian, tissue-specific, and disease-associated settings.

Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation.

Lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) play a crucial but still poorly understood role in regulating alveolar repair. Here, we studied the role of the LMVEC-derived bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in promoting alveolar repair using mice with endothelial-specific deletion of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), the key enzyme promoting S1P generation. These mutant lungs developed airspace-enlargement lesions and exhibited a reduced number of AT1 cells after Pseudomonas-aeruginosa-induced lung injury. We demonstrated that S1P released by LMVECs acted via its receptor, S1PR2, on AT2 cells and induced nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a regulator of AT2 to AT1 transition.

Long-standing hypotheses regarding the retromer sorting mechanism posit that oligomeric interactions between retromer and associated accessory factors on the endosome membrane drives clustering of retromer-bound integral membrane cargo prior to its packaging into a nascent transport carrier. To test this idea, we examined interactions between components of the sorting nexin 3 (SNX3)-retromer sorting pathway using quantitative single particle fluorescence microscopy in a reconstituted system. This system includes a supported lipid bilayer, fluorescently labeled retromer, SNX3, and two model cargo proteins, RAB7, and retromer-binding segments of the WASHC2C subunit of the WASH complex. We found that the distribution of membrane-associated retromer is predominantly comprised of monomer (∼18%), dimer (∼35%), trimer (∼24%), and tetramer (∼13%). Unexpectedly, neither the presence of membrane-associated cargo nor accessory factors substantially affected this distribution. The results indicate that retromer has an intrinsic propensity to form low order oligomers on a supported lipid bilayer and that neither membrane association nor accessory factors potentiate oligomerization. The results support a model whereby SNX3-retromer is a minimally concentrative coat protein complex adapted to bulk membrane trafficking from the endosomal system."	0

Deficiency in BUD13 was associated with increased IR, decreased mature Irf7 transcript and protein levels, and consequently a dampened type I interferon response, which compromised the ability of BUD13-deficient macrophages to withstand vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Global analysis of BUD13 knockdown and BUD13 cross-linking to RNA revealed a subset of introns that share many characteristics with the one found in Irf7 and are spliced in a BUD13-dependent manner. Deficiency of BUD13 led to decreased mature transcript from genes containing such introns. Thus, by acting as an antagonist to IR, BUD13 facilitates the expression of genes at which IR occurs."	0

To discover underlying regulation, we assess transcriptome datasets for dynamic gene networks during heart regeneration and identify suppression of genes associated with the transcription factor Tp53. Cardiac damage leads to fluctuation of Tp53 protein levels, concomitant with induced expression of its central negative regulator, mdm2, in regenerating cardiomyocytes. Zebrafish lacking functional Tp53 display increased indicators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration, whereas transgenic Mdm2 blockade inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Induced myocardial overexpression of the mitogenic factors Nrg1 or Vegfaa in the absence of injury also upregulates mdm2 and suppresses Tp53 levels, and tp53 mutations augment the mitogenic effects of Nrg1. mdm2 induction is spatiotemporally associated with markers of de-differentiation in injury and growth contexts, suggesting a broad role in cardiogenesis.

Using single-molecule imaging of reconstituted human DNA repair factors, we identify phosphorylated RPA (pRPA) as a negative resection regulator. Bloom's syndrome (BLM) helicase together with exonuclease 1 (EXO1) and DNA2 nucleases catalyze kilobase-length DNA resection on nucleosome-coated DNA. The resulting ssDNA is rapidly bound by RPA, which further stimulates DNA resection. RPA is phosphorylated during resection as part of the DNA damage response (DDR). Remarkably, pRPA inhibits DNA resection in cellular assays and in vitro via inhibition of BLM helicase. pRPA suppresses BLM initiation at DNA ends and promotes the intrinsic helicase strand-switching activity.

"31901446"	"Su(var)2-10 and the SUMO Pathway Link piRNA-Guided Target Recognition to Chromatin Silencing.Regulation of transcription is the main mechanism responsible for precise control of gene expression. Whereas the majority of transcriptional regulation is mediated by DNA-binding transcription factors that bind to regulatory gene regions, an elegant alternative strategy employs small RNA guides, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to identify targets of transcriptional repression. Here, we show that in Drosophila the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO and the SUMO E3 ligase Su(var)2-10 are required for piRNA-guided deposition of repressive chromatin marks and transcriptional silencing of piRNA targets. Su(var)2-10 links the piRNA-guided target recognition complex to the silencing effector by binding the piRNA/Piwi complex and inducing SUMO-dependent recruitment of the SetDB1/Wde histone methyltransferase effector. We propose that in Drosophila, the nuclear piRNA pathway has co-opted a conserved mechanism of SUMO-dependent recruitment of the SetDB1/Wde chromatin modifier to confer repression of genomic parasites."	1
