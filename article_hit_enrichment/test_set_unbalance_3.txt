"32518164"	"Cytochrome <i>c</i> nitrite reductase from the bacterium <i>Geobacter lovleyi</i> represents a new NrfA subclass.Cytochrome <i>c</i> nitrite reductase (NrfA) catalyzes the reduction of nitrite to ammonium in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) pathway, a process that competes with denitrification, conserves nitrogen, and minimizes nutrient loss in soils. The environmental bacterium <i>Geobacter lovleyi</i> has recently been recognized as a key driver of DNRA in nature, but its enzymatic pathway is still uncharacterized. To address this limitation, here we overexpressed, purified, and characterized <i>G. lovleyi</i> NrfA. We observed that the enzyme crystallizes as a dimer but remains monomeric in solution. Importantly, its crystal structure at 2.55-Å resolution revealed the presence of an arginine residue in the region otherwise occupied by calcium in canonical NrfA enzymes. The presence of EDTA did not affect the activity of <i>G. lovleyi</i> NrfA, and site-directed mutagenesis of this arginine reduced enzymatic activity to <3% of the WT levels. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four separate emergences of Arg-containing NrfA enzymes. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, Arg-containing NrfA from <i>G. lovleyi</i> represents a new subclass of cytochrome <i>c</i> nitrite reductase. Most genera from the exclusive clades of Arg-containing NrfA proteins are also represented in clades containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes, suggesting convergent evolution."	0
"32049017"	"Targeting Macrophage Histone H3 Modification as a Leishmania Strategy to Dampen the NF-κB/NLRP3-Mediated Inflammatory Response.Aberrant macrophage activation during intracellular infection generates immunopathologies that can cause severe human morbidity. A better understanding of immune subversion strategies and macrophage phenotypic and functional responses is necessary to design host-directed intervention strategies. Here, we uncover a fine-tuned transcriptional response that is induced in primary and lesional macrophages infected by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis and dampens NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Subversion is amastigote-specific and characterized by a decreased expression of activating and increased expression of de-activating components of these pro-inflammatory pathways, thus revealing a regulatory dichotomy that abrogates the anti-microbial response. Changes in transcript abundance correlate with histone H3K9/14 hypoacetylation and H3K4 hypo-trimethylation in infected primary and lesional macrophages at promoters of NF-κB-related, pro-inflammatory genes. Our results reveal a Leishmania immune subversion strategy targeting host cell epigenetic regulation to establish conditions beneficial for parasite survival and open avenues for host-directed, anti-microbial drug discovery."	0
"32367049"	"FBP1 loss disrupts liver metabolism and promotes tumorigenesis through a hepatic stellate cell senescence secretome.The crosstalk between deregulated hepatocyte metabolism and cells within the tumour microenvironment, as well as the consequent effects on liver tumorigenesis, are not completely understood. We show here that hepatocyte-specific loss of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) disrupts liver metabolic homeostasis and promotes tumour progression. FBP1 is universally silenced in both human and murine liver tumours. Hepatocyte-specific Fbp1 deletion results in steatosis, concomitant with activation and senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Depleting senescent HSCs by 'senolytic' treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence for FBP1 as a metabolic tumour suppressor in liver cancer and establish a critical crosstalk between hepatocyte metabolism and HSC senescence that promotes tumour growth."	0
"32647013"	"Structure-activity analysis of truncated albumin-binding domains suggests new lead constructs for potential therapeutic delivery.Rapid clearance by renal filtration is a major impediment to the translation of small bioactive biologics into drugs. To extend serum <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>, a commonly used approach is to attach drug leads to the G-related albumin-binding domain (ABD) to bind albumin and evade clearance. Despite the success of this approach in extending half-lives of a wide range of biologics, it is unclear whether the existing constructs are optimized for binding and size; any improvements along these lines could lead to improved drugs. Characterization of the biophysics of binding of an ABD to albumin in solution could shed light on this question. Here, we examine the binding of an ABD to human serum albumin using isothermal titration calorimetry and assess the structural integrity of the ABD using CD, NMR, and molecular dynamics. A structure-activity analysis of truncations of the ABD suggests that downsized variants could replace the full-length domain. Reducing size could have the benefit of reducing potential immunogenicity problems. We further showed that one of these variants could be used to design a bifunctional molecule with affinity for albumin and a serum protein involved in cholesterol metabolism, PCSK9, demonstrating the potential utility of these fragments in the design of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Future work could extend these <i>in vitro</i> binding studies to other ABD variants to develop therapeutics. Our study presents new understanding of the solution structural and binding properties of ABDs, which has implications for the design of next-generation long-lasting therapeutics."	0
"31806350"	"The ER-Localized Transmembrane Protein TMEM39A/SUSR2 Regulates Autophagy by Controlling the Trafficking of the PtdIns(4)P Phosphatase SAC1.TMEM39A, encoding an ER-localized transmembrane protein, is a susceptibility locus for multiple autoimmune diseases. The molecular function of TMEM39A remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrated that TMEM39A, also called SUSR2, modulates autophagy activity by regulating the spatial distribution and levels of PtdIns(4)P. Depletion of SUSR2 elevates late endosomal/lysosomal PtdIns(4)P levels, facilitating recruitment of the HOPS complex to promote assembly of the SNARE complex for autophagosome maturation. SUSR2 knockdown also increases the degradative capability of lysosomes. Mechanistically, SUSR2 interacts with the ER-localized PtdIns(4)P phosphatase SAC1 and also the COPII SEC23/SEC24 subunits to promote the ER-to-Golgi transport of SAC1. Retention of SAC1 on the ER in SUSR2 knockdown cells increases the level of PtdIns(3)P produced by the VPS34 complex, promoting autophagosome formation. Our study reveals that TMEM39A/SUSR2 acts as an adaptor protein for efficient export of SAC1 from the ER and provides insights into the pathogenesis of diseases associated with TMEM39A mutations."	0
"31995765"	"Human Bone Marrow Is Comprised of Adipocytes with Specific Lipid Metabolism.Under caloric restriction, bone marrow adipocytes (BM-Ads) do not decrease in size compared to white adipocytes, suggesting they harbor unique metabolic properties. We compare human primary BM-Ads with paired subcutaneous adipocytes (SC-Ads) using proteomic and lipidomic approaches. We find that, although SC-Ads and BM-Ads share similar morphological features, they possess distinct lipid metabolism. Although BM-Ad shows enrichment in proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, correlating with increased free cholesterol content, proteins involved in lipolysis were downregulated. In particular, monoacylglycerol lipase expression is strongly reduced in BM-Ads, leading to monoacylglycerol accumulation. Consequently, basal and induced lipolytic responses are absent in BM-Ads, affirming their differences in metabolic fitness upon caloric restriction. These specific metabolic features are not recapitulated in vitro using common protocols to differentiate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, contrary to classical SC-Ads, BM-Ads display a specific lipid metabolism, as they are devoid of lipolytic activity and exhibit a cholesterol-orientated metabolism."	0
"32492415"	"Radiation Triggers a Dynamic Sequence of Transient Microglial Alterations in Juvenile Brain.Cranial irradiation (IR), an effective tool to treat malignant brain tumors, triggers a chronic pro-inflammatory microglial response, at least in the adult brain. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, combined with histology, we show that the microglial response in the juvenile mouse hippocampus is rapid but returns toward normal within 1 week. The response is characterized by a series of temporally distinct homeostasis-, sensome-, and inflammation-related molecular signatures. We find that a single microglial cell simultaneously upregulates transcripts associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. Finally, we show that juvenile and adult irradiated microglia are already transcriptionally distinct in the early phase after IR. Our results indicate that microglia are involved in the initial stages but may not be responsible for driving long-term inflammation in the juvenile brain."	0
"31226277"	"Structural Basis of an Asymmetric Condensin ATPase Cycle.The condensin protein complex plays a key role in the structural organization of genomes. How the ATPase activity of its SMC subunits drives large-scale changes in chromosome topology has remained unknown. Here we reconstruct, at near-atomic resolution, the sequence of events that take place during the condensin ATPase cycle. We show that ATP binding induces a conformational switch in the Smc4 head domain that releases its hitherto undescribed interaction with the Ycs4 HEAT-repeat subunit and promotes its engagement with the Smc2 head into an asymmetric heterodimer. SMC head dimerization subsequently enables nucleotide binding at the second active site and disengages the Brn1 kleisin subunit from the Smc2 coiled coil to open the condensin ring. These large-scale transitions in the condensin architecture lay out a mechanistic path for its ability to extrude DNA helices into large loop structures."	0
"31051141"	"Reversible Disruption of Specific Transcription Factor-DNA Interactions Using CRISPR/Cas9.The control of gene expression by transcription factor binding sites frequently determines phenotype. However, it is difficult to determine the function of single transcription factor binding sites within larger transcription networks. Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to disrupt binding to specific sites, a method we term CRISPRd. Since CRISPR guide RNAs are longer than transcription factor binding sites, flanking sequence can be used to target specific sites. Targeting dCas9 to an Oct4 site in the Nanog promoter displaced Oct4 from this site, reduced Nanog expression, and slowed division. In contrast, disrupting the Oct4 binding site adjacent to Pax6 upregulated Pax6 transcription and disrupting Nanog binding its own promoter upregulated its transcription. Thus, we can easily distinguish between activating and repressing binding sites and examine autoregulation. Finally, multiple guide RNA expression allows simultaneous inhibition of multiple binding sites, and conditionally destabilized dCas9 allows rapid reversibility."	0
"32814054"	"Mn<sup>2+</sup> Directly Activates cGAS and Structural Analysis Suggests Mn<sup>2+</sup> Induces a Noncanonical Catalytic Synthesis of 2'3'-cGAMP.DNA binding allosterically activates the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP [cGAMP] synthase) to synthesize 2'3'-cGAMP, using Mg<sup>2+</sup> as the metal cofactor that catalyzes two nucleotidyl-transferring reactions. We previously found that Mn<sup>2+</sup> potentiates cGAS activation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that Mn<sup>2+</sup> directly activates cGAS. Structural analysis reveals that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-activated cGAS undergoes globally similar conformational changes to DNA-activated cGAS but forms a unique η1 helix to widen the catalytic pocket, allowing substrate entry and cGAMP synthesis. Strikingly, in Mn<sup>2+</sup>-activated cGAS, the linear intermediates pppGpG and pGpA take an inverted orientation in the active pocket, suggesting a noncanonical but accelerated cGAMP cyclization without substrate flip-over. Moreover, unlike the octahedral coordination around Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the two catalytic Mn<sup>2+</sup> are coordinated by triphosphate moiety of the inverted substrate, independent of the catalytic triad residues. Our findings thus uncover Mn<sup>2+</sup> as a cGAS activator that initiates noncanonical 2'3'-cGAMP synthesis."	1
"32690609"	"Engineering acyl-homoserine lactone-interfering enzymes toward bacterial control.Enzymes able to degrade or modify acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) have drawn considerable interest for their ability to interfere with the bacterial communication process referred to as quorum sensing. Many proteobacteria use AHL to coordinate virulence and biofilm formation in a cell density-dependent manner; thus, AHL-interfering enzymes constitute new promising antimicrobial candidates. Among these, lactonases and acylases have been particularly studied. These enzymes have been isolated from various bacterial, archaeal, or eukaryotic organisms and have been evaluated for their ability to control several pathogens. Engineering studies on these enzymes were carried out and successfully modulated their capacity to interact with specific AHL, increase their catalytic activity and stability, or enhance their biotechnological potential. In this review, special attention is paid to the screening, engineering, and applications of AHL-modifying enzymes. Prospects and future opportunities are also discussed with a view to developing potent candidates for bacterial control."	0
"32348754"	"Netrin-G1 Regulates Microglial Accumulation along Axons and Supports the Survival of Layer V Neurons in the Postnatal Mouse Brain.Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, accumulate along subcerebral projection axons and support neuronal survival during the early postnatal period. It remains unknown how microglia follow an axon-specific distribution pattern to maintain neural circuits. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of microglial accumulation along subcerebral projection axons that were necessary for microglial accumulation in the internal capsule. Screening of molecules involved in this accumulation of microglia to axons of layer V cortical neurons identified netrin-G1, a member of the netrin family of axon guidance molecules with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. Deletion or knockdown of the netrin-G1 gene Ntng1 reduced microglial accumulation and caused loss of cortical neurons. Netrin-G1 ligand-Ngl1 knockout-mice-derived microglia showed reduced accumulation along the axons compared with wild-type microglia. Thus, microglia accumulate around the subcerebral projection axons via NGL1-netrin-G1 signaling and support neuronal survival. Our observations unveil bidirectional neurotrophic interactions between neurons and microglia."	0
"30704899"	"Pacer Is a Mediator of mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 Signaling in Regulation of Autophagosome Maturation and Lipid Metabolism.mTORC1 and GSK3 play critical roles in early stages of (macro)autophagy, but how they regulate late steps of autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 signaling converge to modulate autophagosome maturation through Pacer, an autophagy regulator that was identified in our recent study. Hepatocyte-specific Pacer knockout in mice results in impaired autophagy flux, glycogen and lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates Pacer at serine157 to disrupt the association of Pacer with Stx17 and the HOPS complex and thus abolishes Pacer-mediated autophagosome maturation. Importantly, dephosphorylation of Pacer under nutrient-deprived conditions promotes TIP60-mediated Pacer acetylation, which facilitates HOPS complex recruitment and is required for autophagosome maturation and lipid droplet clearance. This work not only identifies Pacer as a regulator in hepatic autophagy and liver homeostasis in vivo but also reveals a signal integration mechanism involved in late stages of autophagy and lipid metabolism."	1
"32268091"	"A Two-Cell Model for IL-1β Release Mediated by Death-Receptor Signaling.Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key orchestrator of anti-microbial immunity whose secretion is typically dependent on activation of inflammasomes. However, many pathogens have evolved strategies to evade inflammasome activation. Here we describe an alternative, two-cell model for IL-1β release where invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells use the death receptor pathway to instruct antigen-presenting cells to secrete IL-1β. Following cognate interactions with TLR-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), iNKT cells rapidly translocate intracellular Fas ligand to the surface to engage Fas on BMDCs. Fas ligation activates a caspase-8-dependent signaling cascade in BMDCs that drives IL-1β release largely independent of inflammasomes. The apoptotic program initiated by Fas ligation rapidly transitions into a pyroptosis-like form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D. Together, our findings support a two-cell model for IL-1β secretion that may supersede inflammasome activation when cytosolic triggers fail."	0
"32348751"	"Pbrm1 Steers Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Osteolineage Differentiation by Integrating PBAF-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling and BMP/TGF-β Signaling.Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling determines mesenchymal-stromal-cell (MSC) osteolineage commitment and tissue identity. However, molecular integration of developmental signaling with MSC-intrinsic chromatin regulation remains incompletely understood. SWI/SNF-(BAF) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler implicated in multi-cellular development. We show that BMPs and long-term osteogenic signals in MSCs selectively induce expression of polybromo BAF (PBAF) components Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7. Loss of Pbrm1/Arid2/Brd7 profoundly impairs osteolineage gene expression and osteogenesis without compromising adipogenesis. Pbrm1 loss attenuates MSC in vivo ossification. Mechanistically, Pbrm1/PBAF deficiency impairs Smad1/5/8 activation through locus-specific epi-genomic remodeling, involving Pbrm1 bromodomains, along with transcriptional downregulation of Bmpr/TgfβrII affecting BMP-early-responsive gene expression. Gain of function of BmprIβ, TgfβrII in PBAF-deficient MSCs partly restores Smad1/5/8 activation and osteogenesis. Pbrm1 loss further affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor activity through non-cell-autonomous regulation of microenvironment and niche-factor expression. Together, these findings reveal a link illustrating epi-genomic feedforward control of BMP/TGF-β signaling to transcriptional and cellular plasticity in the mesenchymal microenvironment and account for stromal-SWI/SNF in hematopoiesis."	1
"32402274"	"Protein Kinase A Catalytic Subunit Is a Molecular Switch that Promotes the Pro-tumoral Function of Macrophages.As current therapies benefit only a minority of cancer patients, additional therapeutic targets are needed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have attracted attention for improving therapeutic responses, yet regulatory strategies remain elusive. Here, we show that the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) acts as a molecular switch, inducing a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. In human and murine breast cancer, overactivated PKA in TAMs creates a detrimental microenvironment for cancer progression by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and macrophage-derived arginase 1 (ARG1) expression. Macrophages with genetic deletion of PKA-C are prone to be pro-inflammatory, suggesting a possible immunotherapeutic target. Delivery of liposomal PKA inhibitor facilitates tumor regression and abrogates pro-tumoral TAM functions in mice. The therapeutic effect of targeting PKA is pronounced when combined with αCTLA-4 antibody, increasing cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)<sup>+</sup>GranzymeB<sup>+</sup> T cells by about 60-fold. Our findings demonstrate critical roles of TAM PKA-C in tumor progression and suggest that targeting PKA-C efficiently augments cancer treatment responses."	0

Here, we report an unexpected role of TDP-43 in the formation of dynamic, reversible, liquid droplet-like nuclear bodies (NBs) in response to stress. Formation of NBs alleviates TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity in mammalian cells and fly neurons. Super-resolution microscopy reveals distinct functions of the two RRMs in TDP-43 NB formation. TDP-43 NBs are partially colocalized with nuclear paraspeckles, whose scaffolding lncRNA NEAT1 is dramatically upregulated in stressed neurons. Moreover, increase of NEAT1 promotes TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. Finally, we discover that the ALS-associated mutation D169G impairs the NEAT1-mediated TDP-43 LLPS and NB assembly, causing excessive cytoplasmic translocation of TDP-43 to form stress granules, which become phosphorylated TDP-43 cytoplasmic foci upon prolonged stress. Together, our findings suggest a stress-mitigating role and mechanism of TDP-43 NBs, whose dysfunction may be involved in ALS pathogenesis."	0

How modes of GC B cell migration influence plasma cell development remained unclear. Through genetic deletion of the F-actin bundling protein Swiprosin-1/EF-hand domain family member 2 (EFhd2) and by two-photon microscopy, we show that EFhd2 restrains B cell speed in GCs and hapten-specific plasma cell output. Modeling the GC reaction reveals that increasing GC B cell speed promotes plasma cell generation. Lack of EFhd2 also reduces contacts of GC B cells with follicular dendritic cells in vivo. Computational modeling uncovers that both GC output and antibody affinity depend quantitatively on contacts of GC B cells with follicular dendritic cells when B cells migrate more persistently. Collectively, our data explain how GC B cells integrate speed and persistence of cell migration with B cell receptor affinity."	0

Following transplantation into mice, SC-β cell function is comparable to human islets, but the magnitude and consistency of response in vitro are less robust than observed in cadaveric islets. Here, we profile metabolism of SC-β cells and islets to quantify their capacity to sense glucose and identify reduced anaplerotic cycling in the mitochondria as the cause of reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in SC-β cells. This activity can be rescued by challenging SC-β cells with intermediate metabolites from the TCA cycle and late but not early glycolysis, downstream of the enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase. Bypassing this metabolic bottleneck results in a robust, bi-phasic insulin release in vitro that is identical in magnitude to functionally mature human islets."	0

"32636303"	"Interleukin-6-mediated epigenetic control of the VEGFR2 gene induces disorganized angiogenesis in human breast tumors.Disorganized vessels in the tumor vasculature lead to impaired perfusion, resulting in reduced accessibility to immune cells and chemotherapeutic drugs. In the breast tumor-stroma interplay, paracrine factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) often facilitate disordered angiogenesis. We show here that epigenetic mechanisms regulate the crosstalk between IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathways in myoepithelial (CD10<sup>+</sup>) and endothelial (CD31<sup>+</sup>, CD105<sup>+</sup>, CD146<sup>+</sup>, and CD133<sup>-</sup>) cells isolated from malignant and nonmalignant tissues of clinically characterized human breast tumors. Tumor endothelial (Endo-T) cells in 3D cultures exhibited higher VEGFR2 expression levels, accelerated migration, invasion, and disorganized sprout formation in response to elevated IL-6 levels secreted by tumor myoepithelial (Epi-T) cells. Constitutively, compared with normal endothelial (Endo-N) cells, Endo-T cells differentially expressed DNA methyltransferase isoforms and had increased levels of IL-6 signaling intermediates such as IL-6R and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Upon IL-6 treatment, Endo-N and Endo-T cells displayed altered expression of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) isoform. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-6 induced proteasomal degradation of DNMT1, but not of DNMT3A and DNMT3B and subsequently led to promoter hypomethylation and expression/activation of <i>VEGFR2.</i> IL-6-induced VEGFR2 up-regulation was inhibited by overexpression of DNMT1. Transfection of a dominant-negative STAT3 mutant, but not of STAT1, abrogated VEGFR2 expression. Our results indicate that in the breast tumor microenvironment, IL-6 secreted from myoepithelial cells influences DNMT1 stability, induces the expression of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells via a promoter methylation-dependent mechanism, and leads to disordered angiogenesis."	1
"31995749"	"Regulatory T Cells Condition Lymphatic Endothelia for Enhanced Transendothelial Migration.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of cell surface lymphotoxin alpha beta (LTα1β2) to activate the LT beta receptor (LTβR) on the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), modulating LEC adhesion molecules, intercellular junctions, and chemokines. We demonstrate a role for Tregs through this pathway to condition the permissiveness of lymphatic endothelia for transendothelial migration (TEM), thus gating leukocyte traffic. Human Tregs share the same property with murine Tregs. Activation of TLR2 on Tregs during inflammation specifically augments LTα1β2-LTβR signaling, which further enhances the permissiveness of LECs to facilitate TEM. The conditioning of endothelia may promote the resolution of inflammation by directing leukocytes out of tissues to lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, Tregs interact with lymphatic endothelia under homeostasis and inflammation and dictate endothelial permissiveness and gating mechanisms for subsequent leukocyte migration through endothelial barriers."	0

A test bed for examining this question is the tongue dorsum, which harbors a complex and important microbial community. Here, we use multiplexed fluorescence spectral imaging to investigate the organization of the tongue microbiome at micron to hundred-micron scales. We design oligonucleotide probes for taxa both abundant and prevalent, as determined by sequence analysis. Imaging reveals a highly structured spatial organization of microbial consortia, ranging in linear dimension from tens to hundreds of microns. The consortia appear to develop from a core of epithelial cells, with taxa clustering in domains suggestive of clonal expansion. Quantitative proximity analysis provides the basis for a model of tongue dorsum microbiome organization and dynamics.

"31831628"	"Muscle-derived Dpp regulates feeding initiation via endocrine modulation of brain dopamine biosynthesis.In animals, the brain regulates feeding behavior in response to local energy demands of peripheral tissues, which secrete orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones. Although skeletal muscle is a key peripheral tissue, it remains unknown whether muscle-secreted hormones regulate feeding. In <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>), the homolog of human bone morphogenetic proteins BMP2 and BMP4, is a muscle-secreted factor (a myokine) that is induced by nutrient sensing and that circulates and signals to the brain. Muscle-restricted dpp RNAi promotes foraging and feeding initiation, whereas <i>dpp</i> overexpression reduces it. This regulation of feeding by muscle-derived Dpp stems from modulation of brain <i>tyrosine hydroxylase</i> (<i>TH</i>) expression and dopamine biosynthesis. Consistently, Dpp receptor signaling in dopaminergic neurons regulates <i>TH</i> expression and feeding initiation via the downstream transcriptional repressor Schnurri. Moreover, pharmacologic modulation of TH activity rescues the changes in feeding initiation due to modulation of <i>dpp</i> expression in muscle. These findings indicate that muscle-to-brain endocrine signaling mediated by the myokine Dpp regulates feeding behavior."	0

At least two independent subcomplexes exist, defined by their specific accessory proteins: PRC2.1 (PCL1-3, EPOP, and PALI1/2) and PRC2.2 (AEBP2 and JARID2). We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1-3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms."	0

Here, using human miR-27a in cell lines as a model, we discovered that a nonfunctional target site unable to base-pair extensively with the miRNA seed sequence can regain function when an upstream adenosine is able to base-pair with a post-transcriptionally added uridine in the miR-27a tail. This tail-U-mediated repression (TUMR) is abolished in cells lacking the uridylation enzymes TUT4 and TUT7, indicating that uridylation alters miRNA function by modulating target recognition. We identified a set of non-canonical targets in human cells that are specifically regulated by uridylated miR-27a. We provide evidence that TUMR expands the targets of other endogenous miRNAs. Our study reveals a function of uridylated isomiRs in regulating non-canonical miRNA targets."	0
"30772174"	"Resolving Cell Fate Decisions during Somatic Cell Reprogramming by Single-Cell RNA-Seq.Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which is a highly heterogeneous process. Here we report the cell fate continuum during somatic cell reprogramming at single-cell resolution. We first develop SOT to analyze cell fate continuum from Oct4/Sox2/Klf4- or OSK-mediated reprogramming and show that cells bifurcate into two categories, reprogramming potential (RP) or non-reprogramming (NR). We further show that Klf4 contributes to Cd34+/Fxyd5+/Psca+ keratinocyte-like NR fate and that IFN-γ impedes the final transition to chimera-competent pluripotency along the RP cells. We analyze more than 150,000 single cells from both OSK and chemical reprograming and identify additional NR/RP bifurcation points. Our work reveals a generic bifurcation model for cell fate decisions during somatic cell reprogramming that may be applicable to other systems and inspire further improvements for reprogramming."	0
"32579929"	"Enhancer RNAs Mediate Estrogen-Induced Decommissioning of Selective Enhancers by Recruiting ERα and Its Cofactor.The function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. By analyzing the genome-wide nascent transcript profiles in breast cancer cells, we identify a special group of eRNAs that are essential for estrogen-induced transcriptional repression. Using eRNAs of TM4SF1 and EFEMP1 as the paradigms, we find that these RNA molecules not only stabilize promoter-enhancer interactions but also recruit liganded estrogen receptor α (ERα) to particular enhancer regions, facilitate the formation of a functional transcriptional complex, and cause gene silencing. Interestingly, ERα is shown to directly bind with eRNAs by its DNA-binding domain. These eRNAs help with the formation of a specific ERα-centered transcriptional complex and promote the association of the histone demethylase KDM2A, which dismisses RNA polymerase II from designated enhancers and suppresses the transcription of target genes. Our work demonstrates a complete mechanism underlying the action of eRNAs in modulating and refining the locus-specific transcriptional program."	0
"32540960"	"Photoaffinity labeling identifies an intersubunit steroid-binding site in heteromeric GABA type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors.Allopregnanolone (3α5α-P), pregnanolone, and their synthetic derivatives are potent positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) with <i>in vivo</i> anesthetic, anxiolytic, and anti-convulsant effects. Mutational analysis, photoaffinity labeling, and structural studies have provided evidence for intersubunit and intrasubunit steroid-binding sites in the GABA<sub>A</sub>R transmembrane domain, but revealed only little definition of their binding properties. Here, we identified steroid-binding sites in purified human α1β3 and α1β3γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs by photoaffinity labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]21-[4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirine-3-yl)benzoxy]allopregnanolone ([<sup>3</sup>H]21-<i>p</i>TFDBzox-AP), a potent GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAM. Protein microsequencing established 3α5α-P inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids near the cytoplasmic end of the β subunit M4 (β3Pro-415, β3Leu-417, and β3Thr-418) and M3 (β3Arg-309) helices located at the base of a pocket in the β<sup>+</sup>-α<sup>-</sup> subunit interface that extends to the level of αGln-242, a steroid sensitivity determinant in the αM1 helix. Competition photolabeling established that this site binds with high affinity a structurally diverse group of 3α-OH steroids that act as anesthetics, anti-epileptics, and anti-depressants. The presence of a 3α-OH was crucial: 3-acetylated, 3-deoxy, and 3-oxo analogs of 3α5α-P, as well as 3β-OH analogs that are GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonists, bound with at least 1000-fold lower affinity than 3α5α-P. Similarly, for GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAMs with the C-20 carbonyl of 3α5α-P or pregnanolone reduced to a hydroxyl, binding affinity is reduced by 1,000-fold, whereas binding is retained after deoxygenation at the C-20 position. These results provide a first insight into the structure-activity relationship at the GABA<sub>A</sub>R β<sup>+</sup>-α<sup>-</sup> subunit interface steroid-binding site and identify several steroid PAMs that act via other sites."	0

Here we describe a genome-wide screen for NMD factors that uncovers an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3' untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen reveals that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which, in turn, is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3' UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3' UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Because of the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3' UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress."	0
"32719007"	"Characterization of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident peroxidases GPx7 and GPx8 shows the higher oxidative activity of GPx7 and its linkage to oxidative protein folding.Oxidative protein folding occurs primarily in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, enabled by a diverse network comprising more than 20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and more than five PDI oxidases. Although the canonical disulfide bond formation pathway involving Ero1α and PDI has been well-studied so far, the physiological roles of the newly identified PDI oxidases, glutathione peroxidase-7 (GPx7) and -8 (GPx8), are only poorly understood. We here demonstrated that human GPx7 has much higher reactivity with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and hence greater PDI oxidation activity than human GPx8. The high reactivity of GPx7 is due to the presence of a catalytic tetrad at the redox-active site, which stabilizes the sulfenylated species generated upon the reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Although it was previously postulated that GPx7 catalysis involved a highly reactive peroxidatic cysteine that can be sulfenylated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we revealed that a resolving cysteine instead regulates the PDI oxidation activity of GPx7. We also determined that GPx7 formed complexes preferentially with PDI and P5 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. Altogether, these results suggest that human GPx7 functions as an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent PDI oxidase in cells, whereas PDI oxidation may not be the central physiological role of human GPx8."	0
"31995746"	"Chronic Viral Infection Promotes Efficient Germinal Center B Cell Responses.Persistent viral infections subvert key elements of adaptive immunity. To compare germinal center (GC) B cell responses in chronic and acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, we exploit activation-induced deaminase (AID) fate-reporter mice and perform adoptive B cell transfer experiments. Chronic infection yields GC B cell responses of higher cellularity than acute infections do, higher memory B cell and antibody secreting cell output for longer periods of time, a better representation of the late B cell repertoire in serum immunoglobulin, and higher titers of protective neutralizing antibodies. GC B cells of chronically infected mice are similarly hypermutated as those emerging from acute infection. They efficiently adapt to viral escape variants and even in hypermutation-impaired AID mutant mice, chronic infection selects for GC B cells with hypermutated B cell receptors (BCRs) and neutralizing antibody formation. These findings demonstrate that, unlike for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, chronic viral infection drives a functional, productive, and protective GC B cell response."	0
"32467227"	"Combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency activates expression of mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1) required for growth of triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer subtype for which effective therapies are unavailable. TNBC has a high frequency of tumor protein p53 (Tp53/p53)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiencies, and combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency is associated with poor prognosis and poor response to anticancer therapies. In this study, we discovered that combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency in TNBC activates expression of the transcription factor mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1). We found that MEOX1 is expressed only in TNBC cells with frequent deficiencies in p53 and PTEN, and that its expression is undetectable in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2+ subtypes, as well as in normal breast cells with wild-type (WT) p53 and PTEN. Notably, siRNA knockdown of both p53 and PTEN activated MEOX1 expression in breast cancer cells, whereas individual knockdowns of either p53 or PTEN had only minimal effects on MEOX1 expression. MEOX1 knockdown abolished cell proliferation of p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC <i>in vitro</i> and inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>, but had no effect on the proliferation of luminal and HER2+ cancer cells and normal breast cells. RNA-Seq and immunoblotting analyses showed that MEOX1 knockdown decreased expression of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B), and STAT6 in p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC cells. These results reveal the effects of combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency on MEOX1 expression and TNBC cell proliferation, suggesting that MEOX1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC."	0
"32075738"	"The Natural Metabolite 4-Cresol Improves Glucose Homeostasis and Enhances β-Cell Function.Exposure to natural metabolites contributes to the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). Through metabolome profiling, we identify the inverse correlation between serum concentrations of 4-cresol and type 2 diabetes. The chronic administration of non-toxic doses of 4-cresol in complementary preclinical models of CMD reduces adiposity, glucose intolerance, and liver triglycerides, enhances insulin secretion in vivo, stimulates islet density and size, and pancreatic β-cell proliferation, and increases vascularization, suggesting activated islet enlargement. In vivo insulin sensitivity is not affected by 4-cresol. The incubation of mouse isolated islets with 4-cresol results in enhanced insulin secretion, insulin content, and β-cell proliferation of a magnitude similar to that induced by GLP-1. In both CMD models and isolated islets, 4-cresol is associated with the downregulated expression of the kinase DYRK1A, which may mediate its biological effects. Our findings identify 4-cresol as an effective regulator of β-cell function, which opens up perspectives for therapeutic applications in syndromes of insulin deficiency."	0
"32402277"	"Nutrient-Driven O-GlcNAcylation Controls DNA Damage Repair Signaling and Stem/Progenitor Cell Homeostasis.Stem/progenitor cells exhibit high proliferation rates, elevated nutrient uptake, altered metabolic flux, and stress-induced genome instability. O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which act in a nutrient- and stress-responsive manner. The precise role of O-GlcNAc in adult stem cells and the relationship between O-GlcNAc and the DNA damage response (DDR) is poorly understood. Here, we show that hyper-O-GlcNacylation leads to elevated insulin signaling, hyperproliferation, and DDR activation that mimic the glucose- and oxidative-stress-induced response. We discover a feedback mechanism involving key downstream effectors of DDR, ATM, ATR, and CHK1/2 that regulates OGT stability to promote O-GlcNAcylation and elevate DDR. This O-GlcNAc-dependent regulatory pathway is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in Drosophila and the DDR in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our findings reveal a conserved mechanistic link among O-GlcNAc cycling, stem cell self-renewal, and DDR with profound implications for stem-cell-derived diseases including cancer."	1
"31176671"	"Cells Deploy a Two-Pronged Strategy to Rectify Misfolded Proinsulin Aggregates.Insulin gene coding sequence mutations are known to cause mutant INS-gene-induced diabetes of youth (MIDY), yet the cellular pathways needed to prevent misfolded proinsulin accumulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that Akita mutant proinsulin forms detergent-insoluble aggregates that entrap wild-type (WT) proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby blocking insulin production. Two distinct quality-control mechanisms operate together to combat this insult: the ER luminal chaperone Grp170 prevents proinsulin aggregation, while the ER membrane morphogenic protein reticulon-3 (RTN3) disposes of aggregates via ER-coupled autophagy (ER-phagy). We show that enhanced RTN-dependent clearance of aggregated Akita proinsulin helps to restore ER export of WT proinsulin, which can promote WT insulin production, potentially alleviating MIDY. We also find that RTN3 participates in the clearance of other mutant prohormone aggregates. Together, these results identify a series of substrates of RTN3-mediated ER-phagy, highlighting RTN3 in the disposal of pathogenic prohormone aggregates."	0
"30878284"	"Apoptotic Caspases Suppress Type I Interferon Production via the Cleavage of cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3.Viral infection triggers host defenses through pattern-recognition receptor-mediated cytokine production, inflammasome activation, and apoptosis of the infected cells. Inflammasome-activated caspases are known to cleave cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Here, we found that apoptotic caspases are critically involved in regulating both DNA and RNA virus-triggered host defenses, in which activated caspase-3 cleaved cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 to prevent cytokine overproduction. Caspase-3 was exclusively required in human cells, whereas caspase-7 was involved only in murine cells to inactivate cGAS, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms in different species. Caspase-mediated cGAS cleavage was enhanced in the presence of dsDNA. Alternative MAVS cleavage sites were used to ensure the inactivation of this critical protein. Elevated type I IFNs were detected in caspase-3-deficient cells without any infection. Casp3<sup>-/-</sup> mice consistently showed increased resistance to viral infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic caspases control innate immunity and maintain immune homeostasis against viral infection."	1
"30795892"	"Structural Basis for the Action of an All-Purpose Transcription Anti-termination Factor.Bacteriophage λN protein, a model anti-termination factor, binds nascent RNA and host Nus factors, rendering RNA polymerase resistant to all pause and termination signals. A 3.7-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure and structure-informed functional analyses reveal a multi-pronged strategy by which the intrinsically unstructured λN directly modifies RNA polymerase interactions with the nucleic acids and subverts essential functions of NusA, NusE, and NusG to reprogram the transcriptional apparatus. λN repositions NusA and remodels the β subunit flap tip, which likely precludes folding of pause or termination RNA hairpins in the exit tunnel and disrupts termination-supporting interactions of the α subunit C-terminal domains. λN invades and traverses the RNA polymerase hybrid cavity, likely stabilizing the hybrid and impeding pause- or termination-related conformational changes of polymerase. λN also lines upstream DNA, seemingly reinforcing anti-backtracking and anti-swiveling by NusG. Moreover, λN-repositioned NusA and NusE sequester the NusG C-terminal domain, counteracting ρ-dependent termination.

"32579924"	"Tonic GABAergic Inhibition Is Essential for Nerve Injury-Induced Afferent Remodeling in the Somatosensory Thalamus and Ectopic Sensations.Peripheral nerve injury induces functional and structural remodeling of neural circuits along the somatosensory pathways, forming the basis for somatotopic reorganization and ectopic sensations, such as referred phantom pain. However, the mechanisms underlying that remodeling remain largely unknown. Whisker sensory nerve injury drives functional remodeling in the somatosensory thalamus: the number of afferent inputs to each thalamic neuron increases from one to many. Here, we report that extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R)-mediated tonic inhibition is necessary for that remodeling. Extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents were potentiated rapidly after nerve injury in advance of remodeling. Pharmacological activation of the thalamic extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in intact mice induced similar remodeling. Notably, conditional deletion of extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the thalamus rescued both the injury-induced remodeling and the ectopic mechanical hypersensitivity. Together, our results reveal a molecular basis for injury-induced remodeling of neural circuits and may provide a new pharmacological target for referred phantom sensations after peripheral nerve injury."	0

"32075774"	"CtBP1-Mediated Membrane Fission Contributes to Effective Recycling of Synaptic Vesicles.Compensatory endocytosis of released synaptic vesicles (SVs) relies on coordinated signaling at the lipid-protein interface. Here, we address the synaptic function of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1), a ubiquitous regulator of gene expression and membrane trafficking in cultured hippocampal neurons. In the absence of CtBP1, synapses form in greater density and show changes in SV distribution and size. The increased basal neurotransmission and enhanced synaptic depression could be attributed to a higher vesicular release probability and a smaller fraction of release-competent SVs, respectively. Rescue experiments with specifically targeted constructs indicate that, while synaptogenesis and release probability are controlled by nuclear CtBP1, the efficient recycling of SVs relies on its synaptic expression. The ability of presynaptic CtBP1 to facilitate compensatory endocytosis depends on its membrane-fission activity and the activation of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme PLD1. Thus, CtBP1 regulates SV recycling by promoting a permissive lipid environment for compensatory endocytosis."	0
"30738703"	"Porin Associates with Tom22 to Regulate the Mitochondrial Protein Gate Assembly.Mitochondria import nearly all of their resident proteins from the cytosol, and the TOM complex functions as their entry gate. The TOM complex undergoes a dynamic conversion between the majority population of a three-channel gateway (""trimer"") and the minor population that lacks Tom22 and has only two Tom40 channels (""dimer""). Here, we found that the porin Por1 acts as a sink to bind newly imported Tom22. This Por1 association thereby modulates Tom22 integration into the TOM complex, guaranteeing formation of the functional trimeric TOM complex. Por1 sequestration of Tom22 dissociated from the trimeric TOM complex also enhances the dimeric TOM complex, which is preferable for the import of TIM40/MIA-dependent proteins into mitochondria. Furthermore, Por1 appears to contribute to cell-cycle-dependent variation of the functional trimeric TOM complex by chaperoning monomeric Tom22, which arises from the cell-cycle-controlled variation of phosphorylated Tom6."	1
"32268084"	"Genome-wide Screens Implicate Loss of Cullin Ring Ligase 3 in Persistent Proliferation and Genome Instability in TP53-Deficient Cells.TP53 deficiency is the most common alteration in cancer; however, this alone is typically insufficient to drive tumorigenesis. To identify genes promoting tumorigenesis in combination with TP53 deficiency, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens coupled with proliferation and transformation assays in isogenic cell lines. Loss of several known tumor suppressors enhances cellular proliferation and transformation. Loss of neddylation pathway genes promotes uncontrolled proliferation exclusively in TP53-deficient cells. Combined loss of CUL3 and TP53 activates an oncogenic transcriptional program governed by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), AP-1, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways. This program maintains persistent cellular proliferation, induces partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and increases DNA damage, genomic instability, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings reveal CUL3 loss as a key event stimulating persistent proliferation in TP53-deficient cells. These findings may be clinically relevant, since TP53-CUL3-deficient cells are highly sensitive to ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibition, exposing a vulnerability that could be exploited for cancer treatment."	0
"32527724"	"The folding and unfolding behavior of ribonuclease H on the ribosome.The health of a cell depends on accurate translation and proper protein folding, whereas misfolding can lead to aggregation and disease. The first opportunity for a protein to fold occurs during translation, when the ribosome and surrounding environment can affect the nascent chain energy landscape. However, quantifying these environmental effects is challenging because ribosomal proteins and rRNA preclude most spectroscopic measurements of protein energetics. Here, we have applied two gel-based approaches, pulse proteolysis and force-profile analysis, to probe the folding and unfolding pathways of RNase H (RNH) nascent chains stalled on the prokaryotic ribosome <i>in vitro</i> We found that ribosome-stalled RNH has an increased unfolding rate compared with free RNH. Because protein stability is related to the ratio of the unfolding and folding rates, this increase completely accounts for the observed change in protein stability and indicates that the folding rate is unchanged. Using arrest peptide-based force-profile analysis, we assayed the force generated during the folding of RNH on the ribosome. Surprisingly, we found that population of the RNH folding intermediate is required to generate sufficient force to release a stall induced by the SecM stalling sequence and that readthrough of SecM directly correlates with the stability of the RNH folding intermediate. Together, these results imply that the folding pathway of RNH is unchanged on the ribosome. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the ribosome promotes RNH unfolding while the nascent chain is proximal to the ribosome, which may limit the deleterious effects of RNH misfolding and assist in folding fidelity."	0

In this study, we show that CD137 signaling, specifically in intestinal CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs), restricts acute colitis progression. Mechanistically, CD137 engagement activates TAK1 and subsequently stimulates the AMPK-PGC-1α axis to enhance expression of the Aldh1a2 gene encoding the retinoic acid (RA) metabolizing enzyme RALDH2. RA can act on CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs and induce SOCS3 expression, which, in turn, suppresses p38MAPK activation and interleukin-23 (IL-23) production. Administration of RA in DC-specific CD137<sup>-/-</sup> mice represses IL-23-producing CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, indicating that RA is a major inhibitory effector molecule against intestinal CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs.

ORC (origin recognition complex) binds to and marks replication origins throughout the cell cycle and loads other replication-initiation proteins onto replication origins to form pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs), completing replication licensing. However, how an asymmetric single-heterohexameric ORC structure loads the symmetric MCM (minichromosome maintenance) double hexamers is controversial, and importantly, it remains unknown when and how ORC proteins associate with the newly replicated origins to protect them from invasion by histones. Here, we report an essential and cell-cycle-dependent ORC ""dimerization cycle"" that plays three fundamental roles in the regulation of DNA replication: providing a symmetric platform to load the symmetric pre-RCs, marking and protecting the nascent sister replication origins for the next licensing, and playing a crucial role to prevent origin re-licensing within the same cell cycle."	0

Moreover, ZGRF1 null cells are defective in catalyzing DNA damage-induced sister chromatid exchange despite accumulating excessive FANCD2, RAD51, and γ-H2AX foci upon induction of interstrand DNA crosslinks. Consistent with a direct role in promoting recombinational DNA repair, we show that ZGRF1 is a 5'-to-3' helicase that catalyzes D-loop dissociation and Holliday junction branch migration. Moreover, ZGRF1 physically interacts with RAD51 and stimulates strand exchange catalyzed by RAD51-RAD54. On the basis of these data, we propose that ZGRF1 promotes repair of replication-blocking DNA lesions through stimulation of homologous recombination."	0

"32601061"	"Characterization of the nonheme iron center of cysteamine dioxygenase and its interaction with substrates.Cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) has been reported to exhibit two distinct biological functions with a nonheme iron center. It catalyzes oxidation of both cysteamine in sulfur metabolism and N-terminal cysteine-containing proteins or peptides, such as regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5). It thereby preserves oxygen homeostasis in a variety of physiological processes. However, little is known about its catalytic center and how it interacts with these two types of primary substrates in addition to O<sub>2</sub> Here, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mössbauer, and UV-visible spectroscopies, we explored the binding mode of cysteamine and RGS5 to human and mouse ADO proteins in their physiologically relevant ferrous form. This characterization revealed that in the presence of nitric oxide as a spin probe and oxygen surrogate, both the small molecule and the peptide substrates coordinate the iron center with their free thiols in a monodentate binding mode, in sharp contrast to binding behaviors observed in other thiol dioxygenases. We observed a substrate-bound B-type dinitrosyl iron center complex in ADO, suggesting the possibility of dioxygen binding to the iron ion in a side-on mode. Moreover, we observed substrate-mediated reduction of the iron center from ferric to the ferrous oxidation state. Subsequent MS analysis indicated corresponding disulfide formation of the substrates, suggesting that the presence of the substrate could reactivate ADO to defend against oxidative stress. The findings of this work contribute to the understanding of the substrate interaction in ADO and fill a gap in our knowledge of the substrate specificity of thiol dioxygenases."	0

Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal BECs, we discover that capillary BECs-compared with arterial and venous BECs-undergo the greatest transcriptional changes in normal aging, upregulating innate immunity and oxidative stress response pathways. Short-term infusions of aged plasma into young mice recapitulate key aspects of this aging transcriptome, and remarkably, infusions of young plasma into aged mice exert rejuvenation effects on the capillary transcriptome. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional age of BECs is exquisitely sensitive to age-related circulatory cues and pinpoint the BBB itself as a promising therapeutic target to treat brain disease."	0
"32579923"	"Microglia Dysfunction Caused by the Loss of Rhoa Disrupts Neuronal Physiology and Leads to Neurodegeneration.Nervous tissue homeostasis requires the regulation of microglia activity. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the small GTPase Rhoa in adult microglia is sufficient to trigger spontaneous microglia activation, producing a neurological phenotype (including synapse and neuron loss, impairment of long-term potentiation [LTP], formation of β-amyloid plaques, and memory deficits). Mechanistically, loss of Rhoa in microglia triggers Src activation and Src-mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, leading to excitotoxic glutamate secretion. Inhibiting Src in microglia Rhoa-deficient mice attenuates microglia dysregulation and the ensuing neurological phenotype. We also find that the Rhoa/Src signaling pathway is disrupted in microglia of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer disease and that low doses of Aβ oligomers trigger microglia neurotoxic polarization through the disruption of Rhoa-to-Src signaling. Overall, our results indicate that disturbing Rho GTPase signaling in microglia can directly cause neurodegeneration."	1
"32579942"	"Phenotypic Screen with TSC-Deficient Neurons Reveals Heat-Shock Machinery as a Druggable Pathway for mTORC1 and Reduced Cilia.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder that leads to elevated mechanistic targeting of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. Cilia can be affected by mTORC1 signaling, and ciliary deficits are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine whether neuronal cilia are affected in TSC. We show that cortical tubers from TSC patients and mutant mouse brains have fewer cilia. Using high-content image-based assays, we demonstrate that mTORC1 activity inversely correlates with ciliation in TSC1/2-deficient neurons. To investigate the mechanistic relationship between mTORC1 and cilia, we perform a phenotypic screen for mTORC1 inhibitors with TSC1/2-deficient neurons. We identify inhibitors of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) that suppress mTORC1 through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 rescues ciliation through downregulation of Hsp27. Our study uncovers the heat-shock machinery as a druggable signaling node to restore mTORC1 activity and cilia due to loss of TSC1/2, and it provides broadly applicable platforms for studying TSC-related neuronal dysfunction."	0
"31995762"	"Integration of eQTL and a Single-Cell Atlas in the Human Eye Identifies Causal Genes for Age-Related Macular Degeneration.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss. To better understand disease pathogenesis and identify causal genes in GWAS loci for AMD risk, we present a comprehensive database of human retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Our database comprises macular and non-macular RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from 129 donors, a genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset that includes macula-specific retina and RPE/choroid, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (NucSeq) from human retina and RPE with subtype resolution from more than 100,000 cells. Using NucSeq, we find enriched expression of AMD candidate genes in RPE cells. We identify 15 putative causal genes for AMD on the basis of co-localization of genetic association signals for AMD risk and eye eQTL, including the genes TSPAN10 and TRPM1. These results demonstrate the value of our human eye database for elucidating genetic pathways and potential therapeutic targets for ocular diseases."	0
"32610140"	"Caspase Activation and Caspase-Mediated Cleavage of APP Is Associated with Amyloid β-Protein-Induced Synapse Loss in Alzheimer's Disease.Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) toxicity is hypothesized to play a seminal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how Aβ causes synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. We hypothesize that one mechanism of Aβ-induced synaptic injury is related to the cleavage of amyloid β precursor protein (APP) at position D664 by caspases that release the putatively cytotoxic C31 peptide. In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, Aβ-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of Aβ toxicity. Loss of dendritic spines is also attenuated in mice treated with caspase inhibitors. Importantly, the time-dependent dendritic spine loss is correlated with localized activation of caspase-3 but is absent in APP D664A cultures. We propose that the APP cytosolic domain plays an essential role in Aβ-induced synaptic damage in the injury pathway mediated by localized caspase activation."	0

R-loops are common across many domains of life and cause DNA damage in certain contexts. In this review, we summarize recent results implicating R-loops as important regulators of cellular processes such as transcription termination, gene regulation, and DNA repair. We also highlight recent work suggesting that R-loops can be problematic to cells as blocks to efficient transcription and replication that trigger the DNA damage response. Finally, we discuss how R-loops may contribute to cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory diseases and compare the available next-generation sequencing-based approaches to map R-loops genome wide."	0
"32814056"	"Mono- and Poly-unsaturated Phosphatidic Acid Regulate Distinct Steps of Regulated Exocytosis in Neuroendocrine Cells.Specific forms of fatty acids are well known to have beneficial health effects, but their precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Phosphatidic acid (PA) produced by phospholipase D1 (PLD1) regulates the sequential stages underlying secretory granule exocytosis in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, as revealed by pharmacological approaches and genetic mouse models. Lipidomic analysis shows that secretory granule and plasma membranes display distinct and specific composition in PA. Secretagogue-evoked stimulation triggers the selective production of several PA species at the plasma membrane near the sites of active exocytosis. Rescue experiments in cells depleted of PLD1 activity reveal that mono-unsaturated PA restores the number of exocytotic events, possibly by contributing to granule docking, whereas poly-unsaturated PA regulates fusion pore stability and expansion. Altogether, this work provides insight into the roles that subspecies of the same phospholipid may play based on their fatty acyl chain composition."	0
"30878283"	"Co-translational, Post-translational, and Non-catalytic Roles of N-Terminal Acetyltransferases.Recent studies of N-terminal acetylation have identified new N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and expanded the known functions of these enzymes beyond their roles as ribosome-associated co-translational modifiers. For instance, the identification of Golgi- and chloroplast-associated NATs shows that acetylation of N termini also happens post-translationally. In addition, we now appreciate that some NATs are highly specific; for example, a dedicated NAT responsible for post-translational N-terminal acetylation of actin was recently revealed. Other studies have extended NAT function beyond Nt acetylation, including functions as lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and non-catalytic roles. Finally, emerging studies emphasize the physiological relevance of N-terminal acetylation, including roles in calorie-restriction-induced longevity and pathological α-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Combined, the NATs rise as multifunctional proteins, and N-terminal acetylation is gaining recognition as a major cellular regulator."	0
"32579937"	"Site-Specific Incorporation of Two ncAAs for Two-Color Bioorthogonal Labeling and Crosslinking of Proteins on Live Mammalian Cells.The pyrrolysyl-tRNA/pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylT/RS) pair from the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei (Mma) is widely used in protein engineering to site-specifically introduce noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) through nonsense codon suppression. Here, we engineer the PylT/RS pair encoded by Methanogenic archaeon ISO4-G1 (G1) to be orthogonal to Mma PylT/RS and alter the G1 PylRS active site to accept a complementary ncAA spectrum. We combine the resulting mutual orthogonal pairs for site-specific dual ncAA incorporation of two lysine analogs with high selectivity and efficiency. Demonstrating the robustness of the system, we incorporate two ncAAs with compatible bioorthogonal reactivity into a Notch receptor, as well as a G protein-coupled receptor. We show that selective and site-specific incorporation of two ncAAs allows for two-color bioorthogonal labeling as well as chemical-controlled crosslinking of surface proteins on live mammalian cells."	0
"31378462"	"MISTERMINATE Mechanistically Links Mitochondrial Dysfunction with Proteostasis Failure.Mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis failure frequently coexist as hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease. How these pathologies are related is not well understood. Here, we describe a phenomenon termed MISTERMINATE (mitochondrial-stress-induced translational termination impairment and protein carboxyl terminal extension), which mechanistically links mitochondrial dysfunction with proteostasis failure. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction impairs translational termination of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, including complex-I 30kD subunit (C-I30) mRNA, occurring on the mitochondrial surface in Drosophila and mammalian cells. Ribosomes stalled at the normal stop codon continue to add to the C terminus of C-I30 certain amino acids non-coded by mRNA template. C-terminally extended C-I30 is toxic when assembled into C-I and forms aggregates in the cytosol. Enhancing co-translational quality control prevents C-I30 C-terminal extension and rescues mitochondrial and neuromuscular degeneration in a Parkinson's disease model. These findings emphasize the importance of efficient translation termination and reveal unexpected link between mitochondrial health and proteome homeostasis mediated by MISTERMINATE."	0
"32160543"	"MYC Dysregulates Mitosis, Revealing Cancer Vulnerabilities.Tumors that overexpress the MYC oncogene are frequently aneuploid, a state associated with highly aggressive cancers and tumor evolution. However, how MYC causes aneuploidy is not well understood. Here, we show that MYC overexpression induces mitotic spindle assembly defects and chromosomal instability (CIN) through effects on microtubule nucleation and organization. Attenuating MYC expression reverses mitotic defects, even in established tumor cell lines, indicating an ongoing role for MYC in CIN. MYC reprograms mitotic gene expression, and we identify TPX2 to be permissive for spindle assembly in MYC-high cells. TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death, and prevents tumor growth. Further elevating TPX2 expression reduces mitotic defects in MYC-high cells. MYC and TPX2 expression may be useful biomarkers to stratify patients for anti-mitotic therapies. Our studies implicate MYC as a regulator of mitosis and suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution."	0
"32473093"	"Acetyl-CoA Derived from Hepatic Peroxisomal β-Oxidation Inhibits Autophagy and Promotes Steatosis via mTORC1 Activation.Autophagy is activated by prolonged fasting but cannot overcome the ensuing hepatic lipid overload, resulting in fatty liver. Here, we describe a peroxisome-lysosome metabolic link that restricts autophagic degradation of lipids. Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in peroxisomal β-oxidation, is enriched in liver and further increases with fasting or high-fat diet (HFD). Liver-specific Acox1 knockout (Acox1-LKO) protected mice against hepatic steatosis caused by starvation or HFD due to induction of autophagic degradation of lipid droplets. Hepatic Acox1 deficiency markedly lowered total cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels, which led to decreased Raptor acetylation and reduced lysosomal localization of mTOR, resulting in impaired activation of mTORC1, a central regulator of autophagy. Dichloroacetic acid treatment elevated acetyl-CoA levels, restored mTORC1 activation, inhibited autophagy, and increased hepatic triglycerides in Acox1-LKO mice. These results identify peroxisome-derived acetyl-CoA as a key metabolic regulator of autophagy that controls hepatic lipid homeostasis."	0
"30853400"	"FIP200 Claw Domain Binding to p62 Promotes Autophagosome Formation at Ubiquitin Condensates.The autophagy cargo receptor p62 facilitates the condensation of misfolded, ubiquitin-positive proteins and their degradation by autophagy, but the molecular mechanism of p62 signaling to the core autophagy machinery is unclear. Here, we show that disordered residues 326-380 of p62 directly interact with the C-terminal region (CTR) of FIP200. Crystal structure determination shows that the FIP200 CTR contains a dimeric globular domain that we designated the ""Claw"" for its shape. The interaction of p62 with FIP200 is mediated by a positively charged pocket in the Claw, enhanced by p62 phosphorylation, mutually exclusive with the binding of p62 to LC3B, and it promotes degradation of ubiquitinated cargo by autophagy. Furthermore, the recruitment of the FIP200 CTR slows the phase separation of ubiquitinated proteins by p62 in a reconstituted system. Our data provide the molecular basis for a crosstalk between cargo condensation and autophagosome formation."	1
"30661980"	"An Isoprene Lipid-Binding Protein Promotes Eukaryotic Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis.The biosynthesis of coenzyme Q presents a paradigm for how cells surmount hydrophobic barriers in lipid biology. In eukaryotes, CoQ precursors-among nature's most hydrophobic molecules-must somehow be presented to a series of enzymes peripherally associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we reveal that this process relies on custom lipid-binding properties of COQ9. We show that COQ9 repurposes the bacterial TetR fold to bind aromatic isoprenes with high specificity, including CoQ intermediates that likely reside entirely within the bilayer. We reveal a process by which COQ9 associates with cardiolipin-rich membranes and warps the membrane surface to access this cargo. Finally, we identify a molecular interface between COQ9 and the hydroxylase COQ7, motivating a model whereby COQ9 presents intermediates directly to CoQ enzymes. Overall, our results provide a mechanism for how a lipid-binding protein might access, select, and deliver specific cargo from a membrane to promote biosynthesis."	0
"32719003"	"Quantitating denaturation by formic acid: imperfect repeats are essential to the stability of the functional amyloid protein FapC.Bacterial functional amyloids are evolutionarily optimized to aggregate, so much so that the extreme robustness of functional amyloid makes it very difficult to examine their structure-function relationships in a detailed manner. Previous work has shown that functional amyloids are resistant to conventional chemical denaturants, but they dissolve in formic acid (FA) at high concentrations. However, systematic investigation requires a quantitative analysis of FA's ability to denature proteins. Amyloid formed by <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. protein FapC provides an excellent model to investigate FA denaturation. It contains three imperfect repeats, and stepwise removal of these repeats slows fibrillation and increases fragmentation during aggregation. However, the link to stability is unclear. We first calibrated FA denaturation using three small, globular, and acid-resistant proteins. This revealed a linear relationship between the concentration of FA and the free energy of unfolding with a slope of <i>m</i><sub>FA+pH</sub> (the combined contribution of FA and FA-induced lowering of pH), as well as a robust correlation between protein size and <i>m</i><sub>FA+pH</sub> We then measured the solubilization of fibrils formed from different FapC variants with varying numbers of repeats as a function of the concentration of FA. This revealed a decline in the number of residues driving amyloid formation upon deleting at least two repeats. The midpoint of denaturation declined with the removal of repeats. Complete removal of all repeats led to fibrils that were solubilized at FA concentrations 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the repeat-containing variants, showing that at least one repeat is required for the stability of functional amyloid."	0
"32521278"	"Enhancer-Driven lncRNA BDNF-AS Induces Endocrine Resistance and Malignant Progression of Breast Cancer through the RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR Cascade.Epigenomic alterations can give rise to various tumor-promoting properties, including therapeutic resistance of cancer cells. Here, we identify an lncRNA, BDNF-AS, whose overexpression is specifically driven by a MEF2A-regulated enhancer in endocrine-resistant and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High levels of BDNF-AS in breast cancer tissues not only feature endocrine resistance in hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients but also correlate with poor outcomes in both HR-positive and TNBC patients. Mechanistically, BDNF-AS acts as a molecular scaffold to promote RNH1 protein degradation via TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of RNH1 at K225. Subsequently, BDNF-AS abolishes RNH1-regulated and RISC-mediated mTOR mRNA decay, therefore sustaining the activation of mTOR signaling. Importantly, mTOR inhibitor, but not PI3K inhibitor, could reverse tamoxifen resistance induced by the overexpression of BDNF-AS. These results point toward a master regulatory role of an enhancer-activated cascade of BDNF-AS/RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR in endocrine resistance and malignant progression of breast cancer."	1
"32846124"	"How Tasks Change Whole-Brain Functional Organization to Reveal Brain-Phenotype Relationships.Functional connectivity (FC) calculated from task fMRI data better reveals brain-phenotype relationships than rest-based FC, but how tasks have this effect is unknown. In over 700 individuals performing seven tasks, we use psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and predictive modeling analyses to demonstrate that task-induced changes in FC successfully predict phenotype, and these changes are not simply driven by task activation. Activation, however, is useful for prediction only if the in-scanner task is related to the predicted phenotype. To further characterize these predictive FC changes, we develop and apply an inter-subject PPI analysis. We find that moderate, but not high, task-induced consistency of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across individuals is useful for prediction. Together, these findings demonstrate that in-scanner tasks have distributed, phenotypically relevant effects on brain functional organization, and they offer a framework to leverage both task activation and FC to reveal the neural bases of complex human traits, symptoms, and behaviors."	0

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate synaptic function of AT neurons remain largely unexplored. We report that AMPA receptor auxiliary subunit GSG1L controls short-term plasticity in AT synapses that receive inputs from the cortex, but not in those receiving inputs from other pathways. A canonical auxiliary subunit stargazin co-exists in these neurons but is functionally absent from corticothalamic synapses. In GSG1L knockout mice, AT neurons exhibit hyperexcitability and the animals have increased susceptibility to seizures, consistent with a negative regulatory role of GSG1L. We hypothesize that negative regulation of synaptic function by GSG1L plays a critical role in maintaining optimal excitation in the AT."	0
"32433954"	"Intrauterine Pressures Adjusted by Reichert's Membrane Are Crucial for Early Mouse Morphogenesis.Mammalian embryogenesis proceeds in utero with the support of nutrients and gases from maternal tissues. However, the contribution of the mechanical environment provided by the uterus to embryogenesis remains unaddressed. Notably, how intrauterine pressures are produced, accurately adjusted, and exerted on embryos are completely unknown. Here, we find that Reichert's membrane, a specialized basement membrane that wraps around the implanted mouse embryo, plays a crucial role as a shock absorber to protect embryos from intrauterine pressures. Notably, intrauterine pressures are produced by uterine smooth muscle contractions, showing the highest and most frequent periodic peaks just after implantation. Mechanistically, such pressures are adjusted within the sealed space between the embryo and uterus created by Reichert's membrane and are involved in egg-cylinder morphogenesis as an important biomechanical environment in utero. Thus, we propose the buffer space sealed by Reichert's membrane cushions and disperses intrauterine pressures exerted on embryos for egg-cylinder morphogenesis."	0

Using optogenetics, we activated terminals from ipsi- or contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or primary motor cortex (M1), or thalamus while obtaining simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs or triplets of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and adjacent interneurons. Ipsilateral corticostriatal projections provided stronger excitation to fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) than to MSNs and only sparse and weak excitation to low threshold-spiking interneurons (LTSIs) and cholinergic interneurons (ChINs). Projections from contralateral M1 evoked the strongest responses in LTSIs but none in ChINs, whereas thalamus provided the strongest excitation to ChINs but none to LTSIs. In addition, inputs varied in their glutamate receptor composition and their short-term plasticity. Our data revealed a highly selective organization of excitatory striatal afferents, which is determined by both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal identity."	0

However, conclusive evidence for the conversion of mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells in these organs is lacking. Using embryonal cell lineage tracing with reporters driven by mesenchymal cell marker genes of the female reproductive tract (AMHR2, CSPG4, and PDGFRβ), we show that these reporters are also expressed by some oviductal and uterine epithelial cells at birth. These mesenchymal reporter-positive epithelial cells are maintained in adult mice across multiple pregnancies, respond to ovarian hormones, and form organoids. However, no labeled epithelial cells are present in any oviductal or uterine epithelia when mesenchymal cell labeling was induced in adult mice. Organoids developed from mice labeled in adulthood were also negative for mesenchymal reporters. Collectively, our work found no definitive evidence of MET in the adult fallopian tube and uterine epithelium."	0

All-in-one AAV delivery of Nme2Cas9 with a guide RNA targeting Pcsk9 in adult mouse liver produces efficient genome editing and reduced serum cholesterol with exceptionally high specificity. We further expand our single-AAV platform to pre-implanted zygotes for streamlined generation of genome-edited mice.

"30902547"	"RNA Circularization Diminishes Immunogenicity and Can Extend Translation Duration In Vivo.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of single-stranded RNAs with a contiguous structure that have enhanced stability and a lack of end motifs necessary for interaction with various cellular proteins. Here, we show that unmodified exogenous circRNA is able to bypass cellular RNA sensors and thereby avoid provoking an immune response in RIG-I and Toll-like receptor (TLR) competent cells and in mice. The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations are found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to the evasion of TLR sensing. Finally, we provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and we show that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs."	0
"32640215"	"Kinetic Heterogeneity of Cancer Cell Fractional Killing.Lethal drugs can induce incomplete cell death in a population of cancer cells, a phenomenon referred to as fractional killing. Here, we show that high-throughput population-level time-lapse imaging can be used to quantify fractional killing in response to hundreds of different drug treatments in parallel. We find that stable intermediate levels of fractional killing are uncommon, with many drug treatments resulting in complete or near-complete eradication of all cells, if given enough time. The kinetics of fractional killing over time vary substantially as a function of drug, drug dose, and genetic background. At the molecular level, the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of the kinetics of fractional killing in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli. These studies suggest that fractional killing is governed by diverse lethal stimulus-specific mechanisms."	0
"32846126"	"Functional Radiogenetic Profiling Implicates ERCC6L2 in Non-homologous End Joining.Using genome-wide radiogenetic profiling, we functionally dissect vulnerabilities of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR). We identify ERCC6L2 as a major determinant of IR response, together with classical DNA damage response genes and members of the recently identified shieldin and CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complexes. We show that ERCC6L2 contributes to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and it may exert this function through interactions with SFPQ. In addition to causing radiosensitivity, ERCC6L2 loss restores DNA end resection and partially rescues homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA1-deficient cells. As a consequence, ERCC6L2 deficiency confers resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in tumors deficient for both BRCA1 and p53. Moreover, we show that ERCC6L2 mutations are found in human tumors and correlate with a better overall survival in patients treated with radiotherapy (RT); this finding suggests that ERCC6L2 is a predictive biomarker of RT response."	0

Here we transplant human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons carrying normal apoE3 or pathogenic apoE4 into human apoE3 or apoE4 knockin mouse hippocampi, enabling us to disentangle the effects of apoE4 produced in human neurons and in the brain environment. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we identify key transcriptional changes specific to human neuron subtypes in response to endogenous or exogenous apoE4.

Here we generated a Brca1<sup>CC</sup> mouse with a coiled-coil (CC) domain deletion.

"32460025"	"The Drosophila Ortholog of Mammalian Transcription Factor Sox9 Regulates Intestinal Homeostasis and Regeneration at an Appropriate Level.Balanced stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcription factor SRY-related HMG-box (Sox) 100B, which is orthologous to mammalian Sox8/9/10, as a common target and central mediator of the EGFR/Ras and JAK/STAT signaling pathways that coordinates intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and differentiation during both normal epithelial homeostasis and stress-induced intestinal repair in Drosophila. The two stress-responsive pathways directly regulate Sox100B transcription via two separate enhancers. Interestingly, an appropriate level of Sox100B is critical for its function, as its depletion inhibits ISC proliferation via cell cycle arrest, while its overexpression also inhibits ISC proliferation by directly suppressing EGFR expression and additionally promotes ISC differentiation by activating a differentiation-promoting regulatory circuitry composed of Sox100B, Sox21a, and Pdm1. Thus, our study reveals a Sox family transcription factor that functions as a stress-responsive signaling nexus that ultimately controls tissue homeostasis and regeneration."	1
"32442397"	"HLTF Promotes Fork Reversal, Limiting Replication Stress Resistance and Preventing Multiple Mechanisms of Unrestrained DNA Synthesis.DNA replication stress can stall replication forks, leading to genome instability. DNA damage tolerance pathways assist fork progression, promoting replication fork reversal, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and repriming. In the absence of the fork remodeler HLTF, forks fail to slow following replication stress, but underlying mechanisms and cellular consequences remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that HLTF-deficient cells fail to undergo fork reversal in vivo and rely on the primase-polymerase PRIMPOL for repriming, unrestrained replication, and S phase progression upon limiting nucleotide levels. By contrast, in an HLTF-HIRAN mutant, unrestrained replication relies on the TLS protein REV1. Importantly, HLTF-deficient cells also exhibit reduced double-strand break (DSB) formation and increased survival upon replication stress. Our findings suggest that HLTF promotes fork remodeling, preventing other mechanisms of replication stress tolerance in cancer cells. This remarkable plasticity of the replication fork may determine the outcome of replication stress in terms of genome integrity, tumorigenesis, and response to chemotherapy."	0

They are also essential for viability in normal growth conditions, but the signal that activates the Mec1-Rad53 pathway in the absence of exogenous insults is currently unknown. Here, we show that this pathway is active at the onset of normal S phase because deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels present in G<sub>1</sub> phase may not be sufficient to support processive DNA synthesis and impede DNA replication. This activation can be suppressed experimentally by increasing dNTP levels in G<sub>1</sub> phase. Moreover, we show that unchallenged cells entering S phase in the absence of Rad53 undergo irreversible fork collapse and mitotic catastrophe. Together, these data indicate that cells use suboptimal dNTP pools to detect the onset of DNA replication and activate the Mec1-Rad53 pathway, which in turn maintains functional forks and triggers dNTP synthesis, allowing the completion of DNA replication."	0

"32554468"	"Discordance between GLP-1R gene and protein expression in mouse pancreatic islet cells.The insulinotropic actions of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) in β-cells have made it a useful target to manage type 2 diabetes. Metabolic stress reduces β-cell sensitivity to GLP-1, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that <i>Glp1r</i> expression is heterogeneous among β-cells and that metabolic stress decreases the number of GLP-1R-positive β-cells. Here, analyses of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq sequencing (scRNASeq) data from mouse and human β-cells indicated that significant populations of β-cells do not express the <i>Glp1r</i> gene, supporting heterogeneous GLP-1R expression. To check these results, we used complementary approaches employing FACS coupled with quantitative RT-PCR, a validated GLP-1R antibody, and flow cytometry to quantify GLP-1R promoter activity, gene expression, and protein expression in mouse α-, β-, and δ-cells. Experiments with <i>Glp1r</i> reporter mice and a validated GLP-1R antibody indicated that >90% of the β-cells are GLP-1R positive, contradicting the findings with the scRNASeq data. α-cells did not express <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA and δ-cells expressed <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA but not protein. We also examined the expression patterns of GLP-1R in mouse models of metabolic stress. Multiparous female mice had significantly decreased β-cell <i>Glp1r</i> expression, but no reduction in GLP-1R protein levels or GLP-1R-mediated insulin secretion. These findings suggest caution in interpreting the results of scRNASeq for low-abundance transcripts such as the incretin receptors and indicate that GLP-1R is widely expressed in β-cells, absent in α-cells, and expressed at the mRNA, but not protein, level in δ-cells."	0
"32755576"	"Stromal Cell-Contact Dependent PI3K and APRIL Induced NF-κB Signaling Prevent Mitochondrial- and ER Stress Induced Death of Memory Plasma Cells.The persistence of long-lived memory plasma cells in the bone marrow depends on survival factors available in the bone marrow, which are provided in niches organized by stromal cells. Using an ex vivo system in which we supply the known survival signals, direct cell contact to stromal cells, and the soluble cytokine a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), we have elucidated the critical signaling pathways required for the survival of long-lived plasma cells. Integrin-mediated contact of bone marrow plasma cells with stromal cells activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, leading to critical inactivation of Forkhead-Box-Protein O1/3 (FoxO1/3) and preventing the activation of mitochondrial stress-associated effector caspases 3 and 7. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K signaling in vivo ablates bone marrow plasma cells. APRIL signaling, by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, blocks activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-associated initiator caspase 12. Thus, stromal-cell-contact-induced PI3K and APRIL-induced NF-κB signaling provide the necessary and complementary signals to maintain bone marrow memory plasma cells."	1

"32579943"	"The ASC-1 Complex Disassembles Collided Ribosomes.Translating ribosomes that slow excessively incur collisions with trailing ribosomes. Persistent collisions are detected by ZNF598, a ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates sites on the ribosomal 40S subunit to initiate pathways of mRNA and protein quality control. The collided ribosome complex must be disassembled to initiate downstream quality control, but the mechanistic basis of disassembly is unclear. Here, we reconstitute the disassembly of a collided polysome in a mammalian cell-free system. The widely conserved ASC-1 complex (ASCC) containing the ASCC3 helicase disassembles the leading ribosome in an ATP-dependent reaction. Disassembly, but not ribosome association, requires 40S ubiquitination by ZNF598, but not GTP-dependent factors, including the Pelo-Hbs1L ribosome rescue complex. Trailing ribosomes can elongate once the roadblock has been removed and only become targets if they subsequently stall and incur collisions. These findings define the specific role of ASCC during ribosome-associated quality control and identify the molecular target of its activity."	0

APOL1 and APOL3 are death-promoting proteins that are partially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. We report that in podocytes, either APOL1 C-terminal helix truncation (APOL1Δ) or APOL3 deletion (APOL3KO) induces similar actomyosin reorganization linked to the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] synthesis by the Golgi PI(4)-kinase IIIB (PI4KB). Both APOL1 and APOL3 can form K<sup>+</sup> channels, but only APOL3 exhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of high affinity to neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), promoting NCS-1-PI4KB interaction and stimulating PI4KB activity. Alteration of the APOL1 C-terminal helix triggers APOL1 unfolding and increased binding to APOL3, affecting APOL3-NCS-1 interaction. Since the podocytes of G1 and G2 patients exhibit an APOL1Δ or APOL3KO-like phenotype, APOL1 C-terminal variants may induce kidney disease by preventing APOL3 from activating PI4KB, with consecutive actomyosin reorganization of podocytes."	0
"32126208"	"Structures of Gα Proteins in Complex with Their Chaperone Reveal Quality Control Mechanisms.Many chaperones promote nascent polypeptide folding followed by substrate release through ATP-dependent conformational changes. Here we show cryoEM structures of Gα subunit folding intermediates in complex with full-length Ric-8A, a unique chaperone-client system in which substrate release is facilitated by guanine nucleotide binding to the client G protein. The structures of Ric-8A-Gα<sub>i</sub> and Ric-8A-Gα<sub>q</sub> complexes reveal that the chaperone employs its extended C-terminal region to cradle the Ras-like domain of Gα, positioning the Ras core in contact with the Ric-8A core while engaging its switch2 nucleotide binding region. The C-terminal α5 helix of Gα is held away from the Ras-like domain through Ric-8A core domain interactions, which critically depend on recognition of the Gα C terminus by the chaperone. The structures, complemented with biochemical and cellular chaperoning data, support a folding quality control mechanism that ensures proper formation of the C-terminal α5 helix before allowing GTP-gated release of Gα from Ric-8A."	0

Here, we examine the ability of DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to protect against versus exacerbate ZIKV infection by using a histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>0101 transgenic, interferon α/β receptor-deficient mouse model that supports robust DENV and ZIKV replication. By mapping the HLA-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>0101-restricted T cell response, we identify DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes that stimulate interferon gamma (IFNγ) and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Vaccination of naive HLA-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>0101 transgenic mice with these peptides induces a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response sufficient to reduce tissue viral burden following ZIKV infection. Notably, this protective response requires IFNγ and/or TNF secretion but not anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin G (IgG) production. Thus, DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing canonical Th1 cytokines can suppress ZIKV replication in an antibody-independent manner. These results may have important implications for increasing the efficacy and safety of DENV/ZIKV vaccines and for developing pan-flavivirus vaccines."	0
"32320662"	"Pan-retroviral Nucleocapsid-Mediated Phase Separation Regulates Genomic RNA Positioning and Trafficking.The duality of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of cellular components into membraneless organelles defines the nucleation of both normal and disease processes including stress granule (SG) assembly. From mounting evidence of LLPS utility by viruses, we discover that HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) protein condenses into zinc-finger (ZnF)-dependent LLPSs that are dynamically influenced by cytosolic factors. ZnF-dependent and Zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>)-chelation-sensitive NC-LLPS are formed in live cells. NC-Zn<sup>2+</sup> ejection reverses the HIV-1 blockade on SG assembly, inhibits NC-SG assembly, disrupts NC/Gag-genomic RNA (vRNA) ribonucleoprotein complexes, and causes nuclear sequestration of NC and the vRNA, inhibiting Gag expression and virus release. NC ZnF mutagenesis eliminates the HIV-1 blockade of SG assembly and repositions vRNA to SGs. We find that NC-mediated, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinated phase separation is conserved among diverse retrovirus subfamilies, illustrating that this exquisitely evolved Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent feature of virus replication represents a critical target for pan-antiretroviral therapies."	0
"32348750"	"Molecular Basis of Zinc-Dependent Endocytosis of Human ZIP4 Transceptor.Nutrient transporters can be rapidly removed from the cell surface via substrate-stimulated endocytosis as a way to control nutrient influx, but the molecular underpinnings are not well understood. In this work, we focus on zinc-dependent endocytosis of human ZIP4 (hZIP4), a zinc transporter that is essential for dietary zinc uptake. Structure-guided mutagenesis and internalization assay reveal that hZIP4 per se acts as the exclusive zinc sensor, with the transport site's being responsible for zinc sensing. In an effort of seeking sorting signal, a scan of the longest cytosolic loop (L2) leads to identification of a conserved Leu-Gln-Leu motif that is essential for endocytosis. Partial proteolysis of purified hZIP4 demonstrates a structural coupling between the transport site and the L2 upon zinc binding, which supports a working model of how zinc ions at physiological concentration trigger a conformation-dependent endocytosis of the zinc transporter. This work provides a paradigm on post-translational regulation of nutrient transporters."	0
"32565424"	"Pterocarpan synthase (PTS) structures suggest a common quinone methide-stabilizing function in dirigent proteins and proteins with dirigent-like domains.The biochemical activities of dirigent proteins (DPs) give rise to distinct complex classes of plant phenolics. DPs apparently began to emerge during the aquatic-to-land transition, with phylogenetic analyses revealing the presence of numerous DP subfamilies in the plant kingdom. The vast majority (>95%) of DPs in these large multigene families still await discovery of their biochemical functions. Here, we elucidated the 3D structures of two pterocarpan-forming proteins with dirigent-like domains. Both proteins stereospecifically convert distinct diastereomeric chiral isoflavonoid precursors to the chiral pterocarpans, (-)- and (+)-medicarpin, respectively. Their 3D structures enabled comparisons with stereoselective lignan- and aromatic terpenoid-forming DP orthologs. Each protein provides entry into diverse plant natural products classes, and our experiments suggest a common biochemical mechanism in binding and stabilizing distinct plant phenol-derived mono- and bis-quinone methide intermediates during different C-C and C-O bond-forming processes. These observations provide key insights into both their appearance and functional diversification of DPs during land plant evolution/adaptation. The proposed biochemical mechanisms based on our findings provide important clues to how additional physiological roles for DPs and proteins harboring dirigent-like domains can now be rationally and systematically identified."	0
"32554466"	"Phosphorylation of cardiac myosin-binding protein-C contributes to calcium homeostasis.Cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is highly phosphorylated under basal conditions. However, its phosphorylation level is decreased in individuals with heart failure. The necessity of cMyBP-C phosphorylation for proper contractile function is well-established, but the physiological and pathological consequences of decreased cMyBP-C phosphorylation in the heart are not clear. Herein, using intact adult cardiomyocytes from mouse models expressing phospho-ablated (AAA) and phosphomimetic (DDD) cMyBP-C as well as controls, we found that cMyBP-C dephosphorylation is sufficient to reduce contractile parameters and calcium kinetics associated with prolonged decay time of the calcium transient and increased diastolic calcium levels. Isoproterenol stimulation reversed the depressive contractile and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-kinetic parameters. Moreover, caffeine-induced calcium release yielded no difference between AAA/DDD and controls in calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, sodium-calcium exchanger function and phosphorylation levels of calcium-handling proteins were significantly decreased in AAA hearts compared with controls. Stress conditions caused increases in both spontaneous aftercontractions in AAA cardiomyocytes and the incidence of arrhythmias <i>in vivo</i> compared with the controls. Treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil, a positive cardiac inotropic drug, rescued the contractile deficit in AAA cardiomyocytes, but not the calcium-handling abnormalities. These findings indicate a cascade effect whereby cMyBP-C dephosphorylation causes contractile defects, which then lead to calcium-cycling abnormalities, resulting in aftercontractions and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias under stress conditions. We conclude that improvement of contractile deficits alone without improving calcium handling may be insufficient for effective management of heart failure."	0
"32348769"	"HIV-1 Envelope and MPER Antibody Structures in Lipid Assemblies.Structural and functional studies of HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) as a transmembrane protein have long been complicated by challenges associated with inherent flexibility of the molecule and the membrane-embedded hydrophobic regions. Here, we present approaches for incorporating full-length, wild-type HIV-1 Env, as well as C-terminally truncated and stabilized versions, into lipid assemblies, providing a modular platform for Env structural studies by single particle electron microscopy. We reconstitute a full-length Env clone into a nanodisc, complex it with a membrane-proximal external region (MPER) targeting antibody 10E8, and structurally define the full quaternary epitope of 10E8 consisting of lipid, MPER, and ectodomain contacts. By aligning this and other Env-MPER antibody complex reconstructions with the lipid bilayer, we observe evidence of Env tilting as part of the neutralization mechanism for MPER-targeting antibodies. We also adapt the platform toward vaccine design purposes by introducing stabilizing mutations that allow purification of unliganded Env with a peptidisc scaffold."	0
"31914399"	"Modest Declines in Proteome Quality Impair Hematopoietic Stem Cell Self-Renewal.Low protein synthesis is a feature of somatic stem cells that promotes regeneration in multiple tissues. Modest increases in protein synthesis impair stem cell function, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are largely unknown. We determine that low protein synthesis within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is associated with elevated proteome quality in vivo. HSCs contain less misfolded and unfolded proteins than myeloid progenitors. Increases in protein synthesis cause HSCs to accumulate misfolded and unfolded proteins. To test how proteome quality affects HSCs, we examine Aars<sup>sti/sti</sup> mice that harbor a tRNA editing defect that increases amino acid misincorporation. Aars<sup>sti/sti</sup> mice exhibit reduced HSC numbers, increased proliferation, and diminished serial reconstituting activity. Misfolded proteins overwhelm the proteasome within Aars<sup>sti/sti</sup> HSCs, which is associated with increased c-Myc abundance. Deletion of one Myc allele partially rescues serial reconstitution defects in Aars<sup>sti/sti</sup> HSCs. Thus, HSCs are dependent on low protein synthesis to maintain proteostasis, which promotes their self-renewal."	0
"32814049"	"Specific Hippocampal Interneurons Shape Consolidation of Recognition Memory.A complex array of inhibitory interneurons tightly controls hippocampal activity, but how such diversity specifically affects memory processes is not well understood. We find that a small subclass of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R)-expressing hippocampal interneurons determines episodic-like memory consolidation by linking dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) signaling to GABAergic transmission. Mice lacking CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in D<sub>1</sub>-positive cells (D<sub>1</sub>-CB<sub>1</sub>-KO) display impairment in long-term, but not short-term, novel object recognition memory (NOR). Re-expression of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in hippocampal D<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells rescues this NOR deficit. Learning induces an enhancement of in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which is absent in mutant mice. CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated NOR and the associated LTP facilitation involve local control of GABAergic inhibition in a D<sub>1</sub>-dependent manner. This study reveals that hippocampal CB<sub>1</sub>R-/D<sub>1</sub>R-expressing interneurons control NOR memory, identifying a mechanism linking the diversity of hippocampal interneurons to specific behavioral outcomes."	0
"32101735"	"Phase-Specific Microstimulation Differentially Modulates Beta Oscillations and Affects Behavior.It is widely accepted that Beta-band oscillations play a role in sensorimotor behavior. To further explore this role, we developed a hybrid platform to combine neural operant conditioning and phase-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). We trained monkeys, implanted with 96 electrode arrays in the motor cortex, to volitionally enhance local field potential (LFP) Beta-band (20-30 Hz) activity at selected sites using a brain-machine interface. We find that Beta oscillations of LFP and single-unit spiking activity increase dramatically with brain-machine interface training and that pre-movement Beta power is anti-correlated with task performance. We also find that phase-specific ICMS modulates the power and phase of oscillations, shifting local networks between oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Furthermore, ICMS induces phase-dependent effects in animal reaction times and success rates. These findings contribute to unraveling the functional role of cortical oscillations and to the future development of clinical tools for ameliorating abnormal neuronal activities in brain disease."	0
"32846134"	"Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Colon Cancer Cell Response to 5-Fluorouracil-Induced DNA Damage.DNA damage often induces heterogeneous cell-fate responses, such as cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we characterize the transcriptome response of cultured colon cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-induced DNA damage. After 5FU treatment, a single population of colon cancer cells adopts three distinct transcriptome phenotypes, which correspond to diversified cell-fate responses: apoptosis, cell-cycle checkpoint, and stress resistance. Although some genes are regulated uniformly across all groups of cells, many genes showed group-specific expression patterns mediating DNA damage responses specific to the corresponding cell fate. Some of these observations are reproduced at the protein level by flow cytometry and are replicated in cells treated with other 5FU-unrelated genotoxic drugs, camptothecin and etoposide. This work provides a resource for understanding heterogeneous DNA damage responses involving fractional killing and chemoresistance, which are among the major challenges in current cancer chemotherapy."	0

We also analyze stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids; although organoids have a very similar cellular composition at equivalent ages as the fetal retina, there are some differences in gene expression of particular cell types. Moreover, the inner retinal lamination is disrupted at more advanced stages of organoids compared with fetal retina. To determine whether the disorganization in the inner retina is due to the culture conditions, we analyze retinal development in fetal retina maintained under similar conditions. These retinospheres develop for at least 6 months, displaying better inner retinal lamination than retinal organoids. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) comparisons of fetal retina, retinal organoids, and retinospheres provide a resource for developing better in vitro models for retinal disease."	0
"32668237"	"The Cdc48 Complex Alleviates the Cytotoxicity of Misfolded Proteins by Regulating Ubiquitin Homeostasis.The accumulation of misfolded proteins is associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders, but it remains poorly defined how this accumulation causes cytotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the Cdc48/p97 segregase machinery drives the clearance of ubiquitinated model misfolded protein Huntingtin (Htt103QP) and limits its aggregation. Nuclear ubiquitin ligase San1 acts upstream of Cdc48 to ubiquitinate Htt103QP. Unexpectedly, deletion of SAN1 and/or its cytosolic counterpart UBR1 rescues the toxicity associated with Cdc48 deficiency, suggesting that ubiquitin depletion, rather than compromised proteolysis of misfolded proteins, causes the growth defect in cells with Cdc48 deficiency. Indeed, Cdc48 deficiency leads to elevated protein ubiquitination levels and decreased free ubiquitin, which depends on San1/Ubr1. Furthermore, enhancing free ubiquitin levels rescues the toxicity in various Cdc48 pathway mutants and restores normal turnover of a known Cdc48-independent substrate. Our work highlights a previously unappreciated function for Cdc48 in ensuring the regeneration of monoubiquitin that is critical for normal cellular function."	0
"32559422"	"Rational Cancer Treatment Combinations: An Urgent Clinical Need.We are witnessing several revolutionary technological advances in cancer. These innovations have not only contributed to a growing understanding of the tumor and its microenvironment but also uncovered an increasing array of new therapeutic targets. For most advanced cancers, therapy resistance limits the benefit of single-agent therapies. Therefore, some 5,000 clinical trials are ongoing globally to probe the clinical benefit of new combination treatments. However, the possibilities to combine individual treatments dramatically outnumber the patients available to enroll in clinical trials. This comes at a potential cost of missed opportunities, clinical failure, avoidable toxicity, insufficient patient accrual, and financial loss. A solution may be to design combination therapies more rationally, which are informed by fundamental biological and mechanistic insight. We will discuss some successes and failures of current treatment combinations, as well as interesting emerging preclinical concepts that warrant clinical exploration."	0
"32640236"	"Integrated Transcriptome and Network Analysis Reveals Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Calvarial Suturogenesis.Craniofacial abnormalities often involve sutures, the growth centers of the skull. To characterize the organization and processes governing their development, we profile the murine frontal suture, a model for sutural growth and fusion, at the tissue- and single-cell level on embryonic days (E)16.5 and E18.5. For the wild-type suture, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identifies mesenchyme-, osteogenic front-, and stage-enriched genes and biological processes, as well as alternative splicing events modifying the extracellular matrix. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis distinguishes multiple subpopulations, of which five define a mesenchyme-osteoblast differentiation trajectory and show variation along the anteroposterior axis. Similar analyses of in vivo mouse models of impaired frontal suturogenesis in Saethre-Chotzen and Apert syndromes, Twist1<sup>+/-</sup> and Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup>, demonstrate distinct transcriptional changes involving angiogenesis and ribogenesis, respectively. Co-expression network analysis reveals gene expression modules from which we validate key driver genes regulating osteoblast differentiation.

"30595434"	"Noncanonical Modulation of the eIF2 Pathway Controls an Increase in Local Translation during Neural Wiring.Local translation is rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but its control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the extracellular cue Sema3A induces an initial burst in local translation that precisely controls phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α via the unfolded protein response (UPR) kinase PERK. Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers. Finally, we show that PERK signaling is needed for directional axon migration and visual pathway development in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a noncanonical eIF2 signaling pathway that controls selective changes in axon translation and is required for neural wiring."	1

Here, we report that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, but not YTHDF1, are required for reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Mechanistically, we found that YTHDF3 recruits the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase complex and conduces to reprogramming by promoting mRNA clearance of somatic genes, including Tead2 and Tgfb1, which parallels the activity of the YTHDF2-CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Ythdf2/3 deficiency represses mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and chromatin silencing at loci containing the TEAD motif, contributing to decreased reprogramming efficiency. Moreover, RNA interference of Tgfb1 or the Hippo signaling effectors Yap1, Taz, and Tead2 rescues Ythdf2/3-defective reprogramming. Overall, YTHDF2/3 couples RNA deadenylation and regulation with the clearance of somatic genes and provides insights into iPSC reprogramming at the posttranscriptional level."	1
"32877675"	"Controlled Cycling and Quiescence Enables Efficient HDR in Engraftment-Enriched Adult Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells.Genome editing often takes the form of either error-prone sequence disruption by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or sequence replacement by homology-directed repair (HDR). Although NHEJ is generally effective, HDR is often difficult in primary cells. Here, we use a combination of immunophenotyping, next-generation sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate and reprogram genome editing outcomes in subpopulations of adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We find that although quiescent stem-enriched cells mostly use NHEJ, non-quiescent cells with the same immunophenotype use both NHEJ and HDR. Inducing quiescence before editing results in a loss of HDR in all cell subtypes. We develop a strategy of controlled cycling and quiescence that yields a 6-fold increase in the HDR/NHEJ ratio in quiescent stem cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our results highlight the tension between editing and cellular physiology and suggest strategies to manipulate quiescent cells for research and therapeutic genome editing."	0

However, the specific functional roles that Caspr2 plays in the central nervous system and their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report on a functional role for Caspr2 in the developing cerebellum. Using a combination of confocal microscopy, biochemical analyses, and behavioral testing, we show that loss of Caspr2 in the <i>Cntnap2</i><sup>-/-</sup> knockout mouse results in impaired Purkinje cell dendritic development, altered intracellular signaling, and motor coordination deficits. We also find that Caspr2 is highly enriched at synaptic specializations in the cerebellum. Using a proteomics approach, we identify type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R1) as a specific synaptic interaction partner of the Caspr2 extracellular domain in the molecular layer of the developing cerebellum. The interaction of the Caspr2 extracellular domain with IP<sub>3</sub>R1 inhibits IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated changes in cellular morphology.

Here we report that lipid-raft microdomains are essential components of phagolysosomal membranes of macrophages and depend on flotillins. Genetic deletion of flotillins demonstrates that the assembly of both major defense complexes vATPase and NADPH oxidase requires membrane microdomains. Furthermore, we describe a virulence mechanism leading to dysregulation of membrane microdomains by melanized wild-type conidia of the important human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus resulting in reduced phagolysosomal acidification. We show that phagolysosomes with ingested melanized conidia contain a reduced amount of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and that inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calmodulin activity led to reduced lipid-raft formation. We identify a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human FLOT1 gene resulting in heightened susceptibility for invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

"32049022"	"Symmetric Arginine Dimethylation Is Selectively Required for mRNA Splicing and the Initiation of Type I and Type III Interferon Signaling.Alternative splicing is well understood to enhance proteome diversity as cells respond to stimuli. However, mechanistic understanding for how the spliceosome processes precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to achieve template diversification is incomplete. We use recently developed enzymatic inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and human naive T lymphocyte activation as a model system to uncover a precise set of mRNA transcripts that require symmetric arginine dimethylation. This methylation-dependent splicing selectivity is associated with a limited set of signaling pathways that are affected when PRMT5 is inhibited. Specifically, we identify a conserved role for symmetric arginine dimethylation in the induction of antiviral type I and type III interferon signaling following T cell receptor and pattern recognition receptor stimulation in human T lymphocytes and undifferentiated human THP-1 monocytes.

"32753671"	"Robust gene expression programs underlie recurrent cell states and phenotype switching in melanoma.Melanoma cells can switch between a melanocytic and a mesenchymal-like state. Scattered evidence indicates that additional intermediate state(s) may exist. Here, to search for such states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied 10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching. Taken together, these analyses indicate that an intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct and stable 'mixed' GRN rather than being a symbiotic heterogeneous mix of cells."	0

The observed intracellular fGTP is significantly lower than that measured in vitro for wild-type RAS as well as oncogenic mutants, due to both decrease of the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-GTP exchange rate (k<sub>ex</sub>) and increase of GTP hydrolysis rate (k<sub>hy</sub>). In vitro reconstitution experiments show that highly viscous environments promote a reduction of k<sub>ex</sub>, whereas the increase of k<sub>hy</sub> is stimulated by unidentified cytosolic proteins.

Cellular stress prompts differentiating erythroid precursors to express high levels of fetal γ-globin. However, the mechanisms underlying γ-globin production during cellular stress are still poorly defined. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas genome editing to model the stress caused by reduced levels of adult β-globin. We find that decreased β-globin is sufficient to induce robust re-expression of γ-globin, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of differentiating isogenic erythroid precursors implicates ATF4 as a causal regulator of this response. ATF4 binds within the HBS1L-MYB intergenic enhancer and regulates expression of MYB, a known γ-globin regulator. Overall, the reduction of ATF4 upon β-globin knockout decreases the levels of MYB and BCL11A. Identification of ATF4 as a key regulator of globin compensation adds mechanistic insight to the poorly understood phenomenon of stress-induced globin compensation and could inform strategies to treat hemoglobinopathies."	0

"32636305"	"Two highly related odorant receptors specifically detect α-bile acid pheromones in sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>).Pheromones play critical roles in habitat identification and reproductive behavior synchronization in the sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>). The bile acid 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS) is a major component of the sex pheromone mixture from male sea lamprey that induces specific olfactory and behavioral responses in conspecific individuals. Olfactory receptors interact directly with pheromones, which is the first step in their detection, but identifying the cognate receptors of specific pheromones is often challenging. Here, we deorphanized two highly related odorant receptors (ORs), OR320a and OR320b, of <i>P. marinus</i> that respond to 3kPZS. In a heterologous expression system coupled to a cAMP-responsive CRE-luciferase, OR320a and OR320b specifically responded to C<sub>24</sub> 5α-bile acids, and both receptors were activated by the same set of 3kPZS analogs. OR320a displayed larger responses to all 3kPZS analogs than did OR320b. This difference appeared to be largely determined by a single amino acid residue, Cys-79<sup>2.56</sup>, the C-terminal sixth residue relative to the most conserved residue in the second transmembrane domain (2.56) of OR320a. This region of TM2 residues 2.56-2.60 apparently is critical for the detection of steroid compounds by odorant receptors in lamprey, zebrafish, and humans. Finally, we identified OR320 orthologs in Japanese lamprey (<i>Lethenteron camtschaticum</i>), suggesting that the OR320 family may be widely present in lamprey species and that OR320 may be under purifying selection. Our results provide a system to examine the origin of olfactory steroid detection in vertebrates and to define a highly conserved molecular mechanism for steroid-ligand detection by G protein-coupled receptors."	0
"32109364"	"Visualizing the Role of Boundary Elements in Enhancer-Promoter Communication.Formation of self-associating loop domains is a fundamental organizational feature of metazoan genomes. Here, we employed quantitative live-imaging methods to visualize impacts of higher-order chromosome topology on enhancer-promoter communication in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that distal enhancers effectively produce transcriptional bursting from target promoters over distances when they are flanked with boundary elements. Importantly, neither inversion nor deletion of a boundary element abrogates this ""enhancer-assisting activity,"" suggesting that they can facilitate intra-domain enhancer-promoter interaction and production of transcriptional bursting independently of topologically associating domain (TAD) formation. In contrast, domain-skipping activity of distal enhancers was lost after disruption of topological domains. This observation raises a possibility that intra-domain and inter-domain enhancer-promoter interactions are differentially regulated by chromosome topology."	0
"32692975"	"Structure of the Inhibited State of the Sec Translocon.Protein secretion in eukaryotes and prokaryotes involves a universally conserved protein translocation channel formed by the Sec61 complex. Unrelated small-molecule natural products and synthetic compounds inhibit Sec61 with differential effects for different substrates or for Sec61 from different organisms, making this a promising target for therapeutic intervention. To understand the mode of inhibition and provide insight into the molecular mechanism of this dynamic translocon, we determined the structure of mammalian Sec61 inhibited by the Mycobacterium ulcerans exotoxin mycolactone via electron cryo-microscopy. Unexpectedly, the conformation of inhibited Sec61 is optimal for substrate engagement, with mycolactone wedging open the cytosolic side of the lateral gate. The inability of mycolactone-inhibited Sec61 to effectively transport substrate proteins implies that signal peptides and transmembrane domains pass through the site occupied by mycolactone. This provides a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism of Sec61 inhibitors and reveals novel features of translocon function and dynamics."	0
"32187542"	"Differential Modes of Orphan Subunit Recognition for the WRB/CAML Complex.A large proportion of membrane proteins must be assembled into oligomeric complexes for function. How this process occurs is poorly understood, but it is clear that complex assembly must be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of orphan subunits with potential cytotoxic effects. We interrogated assembly in mammalian cells by using the WRB/CAML complex, an essential insertase for tail-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as a model system. Our data suggest that the stability of each subunit is differentially regulated. In WRB's absence, CAML folds incorrectly, causing aberrant exposure of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain to the ER lumen. When present, WRB can correct the topology of CAML both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, WRB can independently fold correctly but is still degraded in the absence of CAML. We therefore propose that there are at least two distinct regulatory pathways for the surveillance of orphan subunits in the mammalian ER."	0
"32294437"	"BCR-Induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> Signals Dynamically Tune Survival, Metabolic Reprogramming, and Proliferation of Naive B Cells.B cell receptor (BCR) engagement induces naive B cells to differentiate and perform critical immune-regulatory functions. Acquisition of functional specificity requires that a cell survive, enter the cell cycle, and proliferate. We establish that quantitatively distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals triggered by variations in the extent of BCR engagement dynamically regulate these transitions by controlling nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), NFAT, and mTORC1 activity. Weak BCR engagement induces apoptosis by failing to activate NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic gene expression. Stronger signals that trigger more robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals promote NF-κB-dependent survival and NFAT-, mTORC1-, and c-Myc-dependent cell-cycle entry and proliferation. Finally, we establish that CD40 or TLR9 costimulation circumvents these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated checkpoints of B cell activation and proliferation. As altered BCR signaling is linked to autoimmunity and B cell malignancies, these results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of aberrant B cell activation and differentiation and therapeutic approaches to target these responses."	0
"31543423"	"Transient Hysteresis in CDK4/6 Activity Underlies Passage of the Restriction Point in G1.Cells escape the need for mitogens at a restriction point several hours before entering S phase. The restriction point has been proposed to result from CDK4/6 initiating partial Rb phosphorylation to trigger a bistable switch whereby cyclin E-CDK2 and Rb mutually reinforce each other to induce Rb hyperphosphorylation. Here, using single-cell analysis, we unexpectedly found that cyclin E/A-CDK activity can only maintain Rb hyperphosphorylation starting at the onset of S phase and that CDK4/6 activity, but not cyclin E/A-CDK activity, is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb throughout G1 phase. Mitogen removal in G1 results in a gradual loss of CDK4/6 activity with a high likelihood of cells sustaining Rb hyperphosphorylation until S phase, at which point cyclin E/A-CDK activity takes over. Thus, it is short-term memory, or transient hysteresis, in CDK4/6 activity following mitogen removal that sustains Rb hyperphosphorylation, demonstrating a probabilistic rather than an irreversible molecular mechanism underlying the restriction point."	1
"31784357"	"Native Chromatin Proteomics Reveals a Role for Specific Nucleoporins in Heterochromatin Organization and Maintenance.Spatially and functionally distinct domains of heterochromatin and euchromatin play important roles in the maintenance of chromosome stability and regulation of gene expression, but a comprehensive knowledge of their composition is lacking. Here, we develop a strategy for the isolation of native Schizosaccharomyces pombe heterochromatin and euchromatin fragments and analyze their composition by using quantitative mass spectrometry. The shared and euchromatin-specific proteomes contain proteins involved in DNA and chromatin metabolism and in transcription, respectively. The heterochromatin-specific proteome includes all proteins with known roles in heterochromatin formation and, in addition, is enriched for subsets of nucleoporins and inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins, which associate with different chromatin domains. While the INM proteins are required for the integrity of the nucleolus, containing ribosomal DNA repeats, the nucleoporins are required for aggregation of heterochromatic foci and epigenetic inheritance. The results provide a comprehensive picture of heterochromatin-associated proteins and suggest a role for specific nucleoporins in heterochromatin function."	0

The composition of these ccfRNAs varies among biofluids. They constitute tantalizing biomarker candidates for several pathologies and have been demonstrated to be mediators of cellular communication. Little is known about their function in physiological and developmental settings, and most works are limited to in vitro studies. Here, we develop iTAG-RNA, a method for the unbiased tagging of RNA transcripts in mice in vivo. We use iTAG-RNA to isolate hepatocytes and kidney proximal epithelial cell-specific transcriptional responses to a dietary challenge without interfering with the tissue architecture and to identify multiple hepatocyte-secreted ccfRNAs in plasma. We also identify specific transfer of liver-derived ccfRNAs to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, where they likely constitute a buffering system to maintain lipid homeostasis under acute high-fat-diet feeding. Our findings directly demonstrate in vivo transfer of RNAs between tissues and highlight its implications for endocrine signaling and homeostasis."	0
"32780989"	"GIT/PIX Condensates Are Modular and Ideal for Distinct Compartmentalized Cell Signaling.Enzymes or enzyme complexes can be concentrated in different cellular loci to modulate distinct functional processes in response to specific signals. How cells condense and compartmentalize enzyme complexes for spatiotemporally distinct cellular events is not well understood. Here we discover that specific and tight association of GIT1 and β-Pix, a pair of GTPase regulatory enzymes, leads to phase separation of the complex without additional scaffolding molecules. GIT1/β-Pix condensates are modular in nature and can be positioned at distinct cellular compartments, such as neuronal synapses, focal adhesions, and cell-cell junctions, by upstream adaptors. Guided by the structure of the GIT/PIX complex, we specifically probed the role of phase separation of the enzyme complex in cell migration and synapse formation. Our study suggests that formation of modular enzyme complex condensates via phase separation can dynamically concentrate limited quantities of enzymes to distinct cellular compartments for specific and optimal signaling."	1
"32665403"	"Prothrombin is a binding partner of the human receptor of advanced glycation end products.The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a key role in mammal physiology and in the etiology and progression of inflammatory and oxidative stress-based diseases. In adults, RAGE expression is normally high only in the lung where the protein concentrates in the basal membrane of alveolar Type I epithelial cells. In diseases, RAGE levels increase in the affected tissues and sustain chronic inflammation. RAGE exists as a membrane glycoprotein with an ectodomain, a transmembrane helix, and a short carboxyl-terminal tail, or as a soluble ectodomain that acts as a decoy receptor (sRAGE). VC1 domain is responsible for binding to the majority of RAGE ligands including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), S100 proteins, and HMGB1. To ascertain whether other ligands exist, we analyzed by MS the material pulled down by VC1 from human plasma. Twenty of 295 identified proteins were selected and associated to coagulation and complement processes and to extracellular matrix. Four of them contained a γ-carboxyl glutamic acid (Gla) domain, a calcium-binding module, and prothrombin (PT) was the most abundant. Using MicroScale thermophoresis, we quantified the interaction of PT with VC1 and sRAGE in the absence or presence of calcium that acted as a competitor. PT devoid of the Gla domain (PT des-Gla) did not bind to sRAGE, providing further evidence that the Gla domain is critical for the interaction. Finally, the presence of VC1 delayed plasma clotting in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that RAGE is involved in modulating blood coagulation presumably in conditions of lung injury."	0
"32661198"	"The first DEP domain of the RhoGEF P-Rex1 autoinhibits activity and contributes to membrane binding.Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>)-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac GTPases, thereby triggering changes in the actin cytoskeleton and in transcription. Its overexpression is highly correlated with the metastasis of certain cancers. P-Rex1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and its activity are regulated via interactions with heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, PIP<sub>3</sub>, and protein kinase A (PKA). Deletion analysis has further shown that domains C-terminal to its catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain confer autoinhibition. Among these, the first dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin domain (DEP1) remains to be structurally characterized. DEP1 also harbors the primary PKA phosphorylation site, suggesting that an improved understanding of this region could substantially increase our knowledge of P-Rex1 signaling and open the door to new selective chemotherapeutics. Here we show that the DEP1 domain alone can autoinhibit activity in context of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment of P-Rex1 and interacts with the DH/PH domains in solution. The 3.1 Å crystal structure of DEP1 features a domain swap, similar to that observed previously in the Dvl2 DEP domain, involving an exposed basic loop that contains the PKA site. Using purified proteins, we show that although DEP1 phosphorylation has no effect on the activity or solution conformation of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment, it inhibits binding of the DEP1 domain to liposomes containing phosphatidic acid. Thus, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the DEP1 domain hampers P-Rex1 binding to negatively charged membranes in cells, freeing the DEP1 domain to associate with and inhibit the DH/PH module."	0
"32755572"	"A Trio of Active Zone Proteins Comprised of RIM-BPs, RIMs, and Munc13s Governs Neurotransmitter Release.At the presynaptic active zone, action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release requires that fusion-competent synaptic vesicles are placed next to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The active zone resident proteins RIM, RBP, and Munc13 are essential contributors for vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel recruitment. Although the individual contributions of these scaffolds have been extensively studied, their respective functions in neurotransmission are still incompletely understood. Here, we analyze the functional interactions of RIMs, RBPs, and Munc13s at the genetic, molecular, functional, and ultrastructural levels in a mammalian synapse. We find that RBP, together with Munc13, promotes vesicle priming at the expense of RBP's role in recruiting presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, suggesting that the support of RBP for vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-secretion coupling is mutually exclusive. Our results demonstrate that the functional interaction of RIM, RBP, and Munc13 is more profound than previously envisioned, acting as a functional trio that govern basic and short-term plasticity properties of neurotransmission."	0
"31588022"	"Dinucleotide Degradation by REXO2 Maintains Promoter Specificity in Mammalian Mitochondria.Oligoribonucleases are conserved enzymes that degrade short RNA molecules of up to 5 nt in length and are assumed to constitute the final stage of RNA turnover. Here we demonstrate that REXO2 is a specialized dinucleotide-degrading enzyme that shows no preference between RNA and DNA dinucleotide substrates. A heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mouse displays elevated dinucleotide levels and alterations in gene expression patterns indicative of aberrant dinucleotide-primed transcription initiation. We find that dinucleotides act as potent stimulators of mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro. Our data demonstrate that increased levels of dinucleotides can be used to initiate transcription, leading to an increase in transcription levels from both mitochondrial promoters and other, nonspecific sequence elements in mitochondrial DNA. Efficient RNA turnover by REXO2 is thus required to maintain promoter specificity and proper regulation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria."	0
"32651234"	"The chaperone Hsp70 is a BH3 receptor activated by the pro-apoptotic Bim to stabilize anti-apoptotic clients.The chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is crucial for avoiding protein misfolding under stress, but is also up-regulated in many kinds of cancers, where its ability to buffer cellular stress prevents apoptosis. Previous research has suggested Hsp70 interacts with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bim and Bax. However, a definitive demonstration of this interaction awaits, and insights into the structural basis and molecular mechanism remain unclear. Earlier studies have identified a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain present in Bcl-2 family members that engages receptors to stimulate apoptosis. We now show that Hsp70 physically interacts with pro-apoptotic multidomain and BH3-only proteins via a BH3 domain, thereby serving as a novel BH3 receptor, using <i>in vitro</i> fluorescent polarization (FP), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and cell-based co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY-HSQC), trypsin proteolysis, ATPase activity, and denatured rhodanese aggregation measurements further demonstrated that BimBH3 binds to a novel allosteric site in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70, by which Bim acts as a positive co-chaperone to promote the ATPase activity and chaperone functions. A dual role of Hsp70's anti-apoptotic function was revealed that when it keeps Bim in check to inhibit apoptosis, it simultaneously stabilizes oncogenic clients including AKT and Raf-1 with the aid of Bim. Two faces of Bim in cell fate regulation were revealed that in opposite to its well-established pro-apoptotic activator role, Bim could help the folding of oncogenic proteins."	1

These characteristics suggest that L6b can strongly modulate brain state, but projections to L6b and their influence remain unknown. Here, we examine the inputs to L6b ex vivo in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex with rabies-based retrograde tracing and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices. We find that L6b receives its strongest excitatory input from intracortical long-range projection neurons, including those in the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, local intracortical input and thalamocortical input were significantly weaker. Moreover, our data suggest that L6b receives far less thalamocortical input than other cortical layers. L6b was most strongly inhibited by PV and SST interneurons. This study shows that L6b integrates long-range intracortical information and is not part of the traditional thalamocortical loop."	0

Important advances have been made to optimize culture conditions and define molecular criteria for naive pluripotency. However, the identity of naive-specific surface markers and the underlying molecular mechanism of naive pluripotency regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) as a prominent naive-specific surface marker by systematic proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ALPPL2 is essential for both the establishment and maintenance of naive pluripotency. Moreover, we show that ALPPL2 can interact with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 to stabilize the mRNA levels of the naive pluripotency transcription factors TFCP2L1 and STAT3 to regulate naive pluripotency. Overall, our study identifies a functional surface marker for human naive pluripotency, providing a powerful tool for human-naive-pluripotency-related mechanistic studies."	1
"32187546"	"β-Amyloid Clustering around ASC Fibrils Boosts Its Toxicity in Microglia.Alzheimer's disease is the world's most common neurodegenerative disorder. It is associated with neuroinflammation involving activation of microglia by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits. Based on previous studies showing apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) binding and cross-seeding extracellular Aβ, we investigate the propagation of ASC between primary microglia and the effects of ASC-Aβ composites on microglial inflammasomes and function. Indeed, ASC released by a pyroptotic cell can be functionally built into the neighboring microglia NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3) inflammasome. Compared with protein-only application, exposure to ASC-Aβ composites amplifies the proinflammatory response, resulting in pyroptotic cell death, setting free functional ASC and inducing a feedforward stimulating vicious cycle. Clustering around ASC fibrils also compromises clearance of Aβ by microglia. Together, these data enable a closer look at the turning point from acute to chronic Aβ-related neuroinflammation through formation of ASC-Aβ composites."	0
"32348756"	"A Sparse, Spatially Biased Subtype of Mature Granule Cell Dominates Recruitment in Hippocampal-Associated Behaviors.Animals can store information about experiences by activating specific neuronal populations, and subsequent reactivation of these neural ensembles can lead to recall of salient experiences. In the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus participate in such memory engrams; however, whether there is an underlying logic to granule cell participation has not been examined. Here, we find that a range of novel experiences preferentially activates granule cells of the suprapyramidal blade relative to the infrapyramidal blade. Motivated by this, we identify a suprapyramidal-blade-enriched population of granule cells with distinct spatial, morphological, physiological, and developmental properties. Via transcriptomics, we map these traits onto a sparse and discrete granule cell subtype that is recruited at a 10-fold greater frequency than expected by subtype prevalence, constituting the majority of all recruited granule cells. Thus, in behaviors known to involve hippocampal-dependent memory formation, a rare and spatially localized subtype dominates overall granule cell recruitment."	0
"32820037"	"Phf21b imprints the spatiotemporal epigenetic switch essential for neural stem cell differentiation.Cerebral cortical development in mammals involves a highly complex and organized set of events including the transition of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) from proliferative to differentiative divisions to generate neurons. Despite progress, the spatiotemporal regulation of this proliferation-differentiation switch during neurogenesis and the upstream epigenetic triggers remain poorly known. Here we report a cortex-specific PHD finger protein, Phf21b, which is highly expressed in the neurogenic phase of cortical development and gets induced as NSCs begin to differentiate. Depletion of Phf21b in vivo inhibited neuronal differentiation as cortical progenitors lacking Phf21b were retained in the proliferative zones and underwent faster cell cycles. Mechanistically, Phf21b targets the regulatory regions of cell cycle promoting genes by virtue of its high affinity for monomethylated H3K4. Subsequently, Phf21b recruits the lysine-specific demethylase Lsd1 and histone deacetylase Hdac2, resulting in the simultaneous removal of monomethylation from H3K4 and acetylation from H3K27, respectively. Intriguingly, mutations in the Phf21b locus associate with depression and mental retardation in humans. Taken together, these findings establish how a precisely timed spatiotemporal expression of Phf21b creates an epigenetic program that triggers neural stem cell differentiation during cortical development."	0

To obtain an unbiased, systems-level understanding of this important process, we here applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to dissect protein release during apoptosis and necroptosis. We report hundreds of proteins released from human myeloid cells in time course experiments. Both cell death types induce receptor shedding, but only apoptotic cells released nucleosome components.

Upon activation, YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus and bind to TEAD transcription factors to promote transcriptional programs for proliferation or cell specification. Immediate early genes, represented by AP-1 complex, are rapidly induced and control later-phase transcriptional program to play key roles in tumorigenesis and organ maintenance. Here, we report that YAP/TAZ directly promote <i>FOS</i> transcription that in turn contributes to the biological function of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ bind to the promoter region of <i>FOS</i> to stimulate its transcription. Deletion of YAP/TAZ blocks the induction of immediate early genes in response to mitogenic stimuli. <i>FOS</i> induction contributes to expression of YAP/TAZ downstream target genes. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of AP-1 suppresses growth of YAP-driven cancer cells, such as <i>Lats1/2</i>-deficient cancer cells as well as Gα<sub>q/11</sub> mutated uveal melanoma.

"32937134"	"Astrocyte- and Neuron-Derived CXCL1 Drives Neutrophil Transmigration and Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability in Viral Encephalitis.Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 encephalitis has significant morbidity partly because of an over-exuberant immune response characterized by leukocyte infiltration into the brain and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Determining the role of specific leukocyte subsets and the factors that mediate their recruitment into the brain is critical to developing targeted immune therapies. In a murine model, we find that the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2 are induced in the brain following HSV-1 infection. Ccr2 (CCL2 receptor)-deficient mice have reduced monocyte recruitment, uncontrolled viral replication, and increased morbidity. Contrastingly, Cxcr2 (CXCL1 receptor)-deficient mice exhibit markedly reduced neutrophil recruitment, BBB permeability, and morbidity, without influencing viral load. CXCL1 is produced by astrocytes in response to HSV-1 and by astrocytes and neurons in response to IL-1α, and it is the critical ligand required for neutrophil transendothelial migration, which correlates with BBB breakdown. Thus, the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis represents an attractive therapeutic target to limit neutrophil-mediated morbidity in HSV-1 encephalitis."	0
"32101741"	"Hedgehog Signaling Modulates Glial Proteostasis and Lifespan.The conserved Hedgehog signaling pathway has well-established roles in development. However, its function during adulthood remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether the Hedgehog signaling pathway is active during adult life in Drosophila melanogaster, and we uncovered a protective function for Hedgehog signaling in coordinating correct proteostasis in glial cells. Adult-specific depletion of Hedgehog reduces lifespan, locomotor activity, and dopaminergic neuron integrity. Conversely, increased expression of Hedgehog extends lifespan and improves fitness. Moreover, Hedgehog pathway activation in glia rescues the lifespan and age-associated defects of hedgehog mutants. The Hedgehog pathway regulates downstream chaperones, whose overexpression in glial cells was sufficient to rescue the shortened lifespan and proteostasis defects of hedgehog mutants. Finally, we demonstrate the protective ability of Hedgehog signaling in a Drosophila Alzheimer's disease model expressing human amyloid beta in the glia. Overall, we propose that Hedgehog signaling is requisite for lifespan determination and correct proteostasis in glial cells."	0

However, how PGC-1α is regulated in response to oxygen availability remains unclear. We demonstrated that lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) binds to PGC-1α and demethylates monomethylated lysine (K) 224 of PGC-1α under normoxic conditions. Hypoxic stimulation inhibits KDM3A, which has a high K<sub>M</sub> of oxygen for its activity, and enhances PGC-1α K224 monomethylation. This modification decreases PGC-1α's activity required for NRF1- and NRF2-dependent transcriptional regulation of TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M, resulting in reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. Expression of PGC-1α K224R mutant significantly increases mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and tumor cell apoptosis under hypoxia and inhibits brain tumor growth in mice.

The scoutRNA differs in secondary structure from previously described tracrRNAs used by CRISPR-Cas9 and some Cas12 enzymes, and in Cas12d-containing systems, scoutRNA includes a conserved five-nucleotide sequence that is essential for activity. In addition to supporting crRNA-directed DNA recognition, biochemical and cell-based experiments establish scoutRNA as an essential cofactor for Cas12c-catalyzed pre-crRNA maturation. These results define scoutRNA as a third type of transcript encoded by a subset of CRISPR-Cas genomic loci and explain how Cas12c/d systems avoid requirements for host factors including ribonuclease III for bacterial RNA-mediated adaptive immunity."	0
"32937135"	"The GSK-3β-FBXL21 Axis Contributes to Circadian TCAP Degradation and Skeletal Muscle Function.FBXL21 is a clock-controlled E3 ligase modulating circadian periodicity via subcellular-specific CRYPTOCHROME degradation. How FBXL21 regulates tissue-specific circadian physiology and what mechanism operates upstream is poorly understood. Here we report the sarcomere component TCAP as a cytoplasmic substrate of FBXL21. FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation. GSK-3β phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP to activate FBXL21-mediated, phosphodegron-dependent TCAP degradation. GSK-3β inhibition or knockdown diminishes FBXL21-Cul1 complex formation and delays FBXL21-mediated TCAP degradation. Finally, Psttm mice show significant skeletal muscle defects, including impaired fiber size, exercise tolerance, grip strength, and response to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy, in conjunction with cardiac dysfunction. These data highlight a circadian regulatory pathway where a GSK-3β-FBXL21 functional axis controls TCAP degradation via SCF complex formation and regulates skeletal muscle function."	1
"31919188"	"The chromatin remodeler Snf2h is essential for oocyte meiotic cell cycle progression.Oocytes are indispensable for mammalian life. Thus, it is important to understand how mature oocytes are generated. As a critical stage of oocytes development, meiosis has been extensively studied, yet how chromatin remodeling contributes to this process is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor Snf2h (also known as Smarca5) plays a critical role in regulating meiotic cell cycle progression. Females with oocyte-specific depletion of <i>Snf2h</i> are infertile and oocytes lacking <i>Snf2h</i> fail to undergo meiotic resumption. Mechanistically, depletion of <i>Snf2h</i> results in dysregulation of meiosis-related genes, which causes failure of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation. ATAC-seq analysis in oocytes revealed that Snf2h regulates transcription of key meiotic genes, such as <i>Prkar2b</i>, by increasing its promoter chromatin accessibility. Thus, our studies not only demonstrate the importance of Snf2h in oocyte meiotic resumption, but also reveal the mechanism underlying how a chromatin remodeling factor can regulate oocyte meiosis."	1
"31924448"	"Antisense-Mediated Transcript Knockdown Triggers Premature Transcription Termination.Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that trigger RNase-H-mediated cleavage are commonly used to knock down transcripts for experimental or therapeutic purposes. In particular, ASOs are frequently used to functionally interrogate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and discriminate lncRNA loci that produce functional RNAs from those whose activity is attributable to the act of transcription. Transcription termination is triggered by cleavage of nascent transcripts, generally during polyadenylation, resulting in degradation of the residual RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated RNA by XRN2 and dissociation of elongating Pol II. Here, we show that ASOs act upon nascent transcripts and, consequently, induce premature transcription termination downstream of the cleavage site in an XRN2-dependent manner. Targeting the transcript 3' end with ASOs, however, allows transcript knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the gene body. These results demonstrate that the effects of ASOs on transcription must be considered for appropriate experimental and therapeutic use of these reagents."	0
"32546484"	"Structure of the unusual <i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i> HH103 lipopolysaccharide and its role in symbiosis.Rhizobia are soil bacteria that form important symbiotic associations with legumes, and rhizobial surface polysaccharides, such as K-antigen polysaccharide (KPS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), might be important for symbiosis. Previously, we obtained a mutant of <i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i> HH103, <i>rkpA</i>, that does not produce KPS, a homopolysaccharide of a pseudaminic acid derivative, but whose LPS electrophoretic profile was indistinguishable from that of the WT strain. We also previously demonstrated that the HH103 <i>rkpLMNOPQ</i> operon is responsible for 5-acetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-7-(3-hydroxybutyramido)-l-<i>glycero</i>-l-<i>manno</i>-nonulosonic acid [Pse5NAc7(3OHBu)] production and is involved in HH103 KPS and LPS biosynthesis and that an HH103 <i>rkpM</i> mutant cannot produce KPS and displays an altered LPS structure. Here, we analyzed the LPS structure of HH103 <i>rkpA</i>, focusing on the carbohydrate portion, and found that it contains a highly heterogeneous lipid A and a peculiar core oligosaccharide composed of an unusually high number of hexuronic acids containing β-configured Pse5NAc7(3OHBu). This pseudaminic acid derivative, in its α-configuration, was the only structural component of the <i>S. fredii</i> HH103 KPS and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported from any other rhizobial LPS. We also show that Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) is the complete or partial epitope for a mAb, NB6-228.22, that can recognize the HH103 LPS, but not those of most of the <i>S. fredii</i> strains tested here. We also show that the LPS from HH103 <i>rkpM</i> is identical to that of HH103 <i>rkpA</i> but devoid of any Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) residues. Notably, this <i>rkpM</i> mutant was severely impaired in symbiosis with its host, <i>Macroptilium atropurpureum</i>."	0
"31604601"	"The Control Centers of Biomolecular Phase Separation: How Membrane Surfaces, PTMs, and Active Processes Regulate Condensation.Biomolecular condensation is emerging as an essential process for cellular compartmentalization. The formation of biomolecular condensates can be driven by liquid-liquid phase separation, which arises from weak, multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids. A substantial body of recent work has revealed that diverse cellular processes rely on biomolecular condensation and that aberrant phase separation may cause disease. Many proteins display an intrinsic propensity to undergo phase separation. However, the mechanisms by which cells regulate phase separation to build functional condensates at the appropriate time and location are only beginning to be understood. Here, we review three key cellular mechanisms that enable the control of biomolecular phase separation: membrane surfaces, post-translational modifications, and active processes. We discuss how these mechanisms may function in concert to provide robust control over biomolecular condensates and suggest new research avenues that will elucidate how cells build and maintain these key centers of cellular compartmentalization."	0
"32294429"	"Progesterone Receptor Serves the Ovary as a Trigger of Ovulation and a Terminator of Inflammation.Ovulation is triggered by the gonadotropin surge that induces the expression of two key genes, progesterone receptor (Pgr) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), in the granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles. Their gene products PGR and PTGS2 activate two separate pathways that are both essential for successful ovulation. Here, we show that the PGR plays an additional essential role: it attenuates ovulatory inflammation by diminishing the gonadotropin surge-induced Ptgs2 expression. PGR indirectly terminates Ptgs2 expression and PGE2 synthesis in granulosa cells by inhibiting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor required for Ptgs2 expression. When the expression of PGR is ablated in granulosa cells, the ovary undergoes a hyperinflammatory condition manifested by excessive PGE2 synthesis, immune cell infiltration, oxidative damage, and neoplastic transformation of ovarian cells. The PGR-driven termination of PTGS2 expression may protect the ovary from ovulatory inflammation."	1
"30982745"	"Dual Role of Ribosome-Binding Domain of NAC as a Potent Suppressor of Protein Aggregation and Aging-Related Proteinopathies.The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factor. Whether NAC exerts chaperone activity and whether this function is restricted to de novo protein synthesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NAC directly exerts chaperone activity toward structurally diverse model substrates including polyglutamine (PolyQ) proteins, firefly luciferase, and Aβ40. Strikingly, we identified the positively charged ribosome-binding domain in the N terminus of the βNAC subunit (N-βNAC) as a major chaperone entity of NAC. N-βNAC by itself suppressed aggregation of PolyQ-expanded proteins in vitro, and the positive charge of this domain was critical for this activity. Moreover, we found that NAC also exerts a ribosome-independent chaperone function in vivo. Consistently, we found that a substantial fraction of NAC is non-ribosomal bound in higher eukaryotes. In sum, NAC is a potent suppressor of aggregation and proteotoxicity of mutant PolyQ-expanded proteins associated with human diseases like Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias."	0
"32616651"	"The autophagy protein Ambra1 regulates gene expression by supporting novel transcriptional complexes.Ambra1 is considered an autophagy and trafficking protein with roles in neurogenesis and cancer cell invasion. Here, we report that Ambra1 also localizes to the nucleus of cancer cells, where it has a novel nuclear scaffolding function that controls gene expression. Using biochemical fractionation and proteomics, we found that Ambra1 binds to multiple classes of proteins in the nucleus, including nuclear pore proteins, adaptor proteins such as FAK and Akap8, chromatin-modifying proteins, and transcriptional regulators like Brg1 and Atf2. We identified biologically important genes, such as <i>Angpt1</i>, <i>Tgfb2</i>, <i>Tgfb3</i>, <i>Itga8</i>, and <i>Itgb7</i>, whose transcription is regulated by Ambra1-scaffolded complexes, likely by altering histone modifications and Atf2 activity. Therefore, in addition to its recognized roles in autophagy and trafficking, Ambra1 scaffolds protein complexes at chromatin, regulating transcriptional signaling in the nucleus. This novel function for Ambra1, and the specific genes impacted, may help to explain the wider role of Ambra1 in cancer cell biology."	1
"32651230"	"Extracellular vesicles secreted by HBV-infected cells modulate HBV persistence in hydrodynamic HBV transfection mouse model.Hepatitis B, a viral infection that affects the liver, is thought to affect over 257 million people worldwide, and long-term infection can lead to life-threatening issues such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. Chronic hepatitis B develops by the interaction between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and host immune response. However, questions of how HBV-infected cells thwart immune system defenses remain unanswered. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are used for cellular communication, carrying cargoes such as RNAs, proteins, and lipids and delivering them intracellularly after being endocytosed by target cells. HBV-infected liver cells secrete several types of EVs into body fluids such as complete and incomplete virions, and exosomes. We previously demonstrated that monocytes that incorporated EVs moved to immunoregulatory phenotypes via up-regulation of PD-L1, an immunocheckpoint molecule, and down-regulation of CD69, a leukocyte activation molecule. In this study, we transfected mice with HBV using hydrodynamic injection and studied the effects of EVs secreted by HBV-infected liver cells. EVs secreted from cells with HBV replication strongly suppressed the immune response, inhibiting the eradication of HBV-replicating cells in the mice transfected with HBV. EVs were systemically incorporated in multiple organs, including liver, bone marrow (BM), and intestine. Intriguingly, the BM cells that incorporated EVs acquired intestinal tropism and the dendritic cell populations in the intestine increased. These findings suggest that the EVs secreted by HBV-infected liver cells exert immunosuppressive functions, and that an association between the liver, bone marrow, and intestinal tract exists through EVs secreted from HBV-infected cells."	0
"32814041"	"Affinity for the Interface Underpins Potency of Antibodies Operating In Membrane Environments.The contribution of membrane interfacial interactions to recognition of membrane-embedded antigens by antibodies is currently unclear. This report demonstrates the optimization of this type of antibodies via chemical modification of regions near the membrane but not directly involved in the recognition of the epitope. Using the HIV-1 antibody 10E8 as a model, linear and polycyclic synthetic aromatic compounds are introduced at selected sites. Molecular dynamics simulations predict the favorable interactions of these synthetic compounds with the viral lipid membrane, where the epitope of the HIV-1 glycoprotein Env is located. Chemical modification of 10E8 with aromatic acetamides facilitates the productive and specific recognition of the native antigen, partially buried in the crowded environment of the viral membrane, resulting in a dramatic increase of its capacity to block viral infection. These observations support the harnessing of interfacial affinity through site-selective chemical modification to optimize the function of antibodies that target membrane-proximal epitopes."	0
"32937138"	"Identification of a Core Module for Bone Mineral Density through the Integration of a Co-expression Network and GWAS Data.The ""omnigenic"" model of the genetic architecture of complex traits proposed two categories of causal genes: core and peripheral. Core genes are hypothesized to directly regulate disease and may serve as therapeutic targets. Using a cell-type- and time-point-specific gene co-expression network for mineralizing osteoblasts, we identify a co-expression module enriched for genes implicated by bone mineral density (BMD) genome-wide association studies (GWASs), correlated with in vitro osteoblast mineralization and associated with skeletal phenotypes in human monogenic disease and mouse knockouts. Four genes from this module (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) are located within the BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and exhibit altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting that they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans. Our network-based approach identifies a ""core"" module for BMD and provides a resource for expanding our understanding of the genetics of bone mass."	0
"30846318"	"Probing the Global Cellular Responses to Lipotoxicity Caused by Saturated Fatty Acids.Excessive levels of saturated fatty acids are toxic to cells, although the basis for this lipotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity."	0

Once activated, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway induces both type I interferon (IFN) expression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated cytokine production. Currently, these two signaling arms are thought to be mediated by a single upstream kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that TBK1 alone is dispensable for STING-induced NF-κB responses in human and mouse immune cells, as well as in vivo. We further demonstrate that TBK1 acts redundantly with IκB kinase ε (IKKε) to drive NF-κB upon STING activation. Interestingly, we show that activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is highly dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, whereas NF-κB is significantly less sensitive to TBK1/IKKε kinase inhibition. Our work redefines signaling events downstream of cGAS-STING. Our findings further suggest that cGAS-STING will need to be targeted directly to effectively ameliorate the inflammation underpinning disorders associated with STING hyperactivity."	1

Mutations in EIF2S3, encoding the γ subunit of the heterotrimeric eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, cause MEHMO syndrome, an X-linked intellectual disability disorder. Here, using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that a mutation at the C terminus of eIF2γ impairs CDC123 promotion of eIF2 complex formation and decreases the level of eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> ternary complexes. This reduction in eIF2 activity results in dysregulation of global and gene-specific protein synthesis and enhances cell death upon stress induction.

"31812350"	"Targeting UBE4A Revives Viperin Protein in Epithelium to Enhance Host Antiviral Defense.Mutation and prevalence of pathogenic viruses prompt the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Viperin is a potent antiviral protein that inhibits a broad range of viruses. Unexpectedly, we found that Viperin protein production in epithelium is defective in response to both viruses and interferons (IFNs). We further revealed that viruses and IFNs stimulate expression of the acetyltransferase HAT1, which induces Lys197-acetylation on Viperin. Viperin acetylation in turn recruits UBE4A that stimulates K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys206 of Viperin, leading to Viperin protein degradation. Importantly, UBE4A deficiency restores Viperin protein production in epithelium. We then designed interfering peptides (IPs) to inhibit UBE4A binding with Viperin. We found that VIP-IP3 rescues Viperin protein production in epithelium and therefore enhances cellular antiviral activity. VIP-IP3 renders mice more resistant to viral infection. These findings could provide strategies for both enhancing host broad-spectrum antiviral response and improving the efficacy of IFN-based antiviral therapy."	1

Yet, how small-scale lipid organization controls physiological events at the PM remains largely unknown. Here, we show that ORP-related Osh lipid exchange proteins are critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>], a key regulator of dynamic events at the PM. In real-time assays, we find that unsaturated phosphatidylserine (PS) and sterols, both Osh protein ligands, synergistically stimulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) activity. Biophysical FRET analyses suggest an unconventional co-distribution of unsaturated PS and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) species in sterol-containing membrane bilayers. Moreover, using in vivo imaging approaches and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Osh protein-mediated unsaturated PI4P and PS membrane lipid organization is sensed by the PIP5K specificity loop. Thus, ORP family members create a nanoscale membrane lipid environment that drives PIP5K activity and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis that ultimately controls global PM organization and dynamics."	1
"31759824"	"MRX Increases Chromatin Accessibility at Stalled Replication Forks to Promote Nascent DNA Resection and Cohesin Loading.The recovery of stalled replication forks depends on the controlled resection of nascent DNA and on the loading of cohesin. These processes operate in the context of nascent chromatin, but the impact of nucleosome structure on a fork restart remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex acts together with the chromatin modifiers Gcn5 and Set1 and the histone remodelers RSC, Chd1, and Isw1 to promote chromatin remodeling at stalled forks. Increased chromatin accessibility facilitates the resection of nascent DNA by the Exo1 nuclease and the Sgs1 and Chl1 DNA helicases. Importantly, increased ssDNA promotes the recruitment of cohesin to arrested forks in a Scc2-Scc4-dependent manner. Altogether, these results indicate that MRX cooperates with chromatin modifiers to orchestrate the action of remodelers, nucleases, and DNA helicases, promoting the resection of nascent DNA and the loading of cohesin, two key processes involved in the recovery of arrested forks."	0

Here, we report that STING gain-of-function in mice prevents development of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. We show that the absence of secondary lymphoid organs is associated with diminished numbers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Although wild-type (WT) α4β7<sup>+</sup> progenitors differentiate efficiently into LTi cells, STING gain-of-function progenitors do not. Furthermore, STING gain-of-function impairs development of all types of ILCs. Patients with STING gain-of-function mutations have fewer ILCs, although they still have lymph nodes. In mice, expression of the STING mutant in RORγT-positive lineages prevents development of lymph nodes and reduces numbers of LTi cells. RORγT lineage-specific expression of STING gain-of-function also causes lung disease. Since RORγT is expressed exclusively in LTi cells during fetal development, our findings suggest that STING gain-of-function prevents lymph node organogenesis by reducing LTi cell numbers in mice."	0

Insights into the sources of IKKα(p45) activation and its downstream substrates in the nucleus remain to be defined. Here, we discover that IKKα(p45) is rapidly activated by DNA damage independent of ATM-ATR, but dependent on BRAF-TAK1-p38-MAPK, and is required for robust ATM activation and efficient DNA repair. Abolishing BRAF or IKKα activity attenuates ATM, Chk1, MDC1, Kap1, and 53BP1 phosphorylation, compromises 53BP1 and RIF1 co-recruitment to sites of DNA lesions, and inhibits 53BP1-dependent fusion of dysfunctional telomeres.

Studying the cen and ik2 genes of Drosophila melanogaster, which are convergently transcribed as cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) with overlapping 3' UTRs, we found that their encoded mRNAs strikingly co-localize to centrosomes. These transcripts physically interact in a 3' UTR-dependent manner, and the targeting of ik2 requires its 3' UTR sequence and the presence of cen mRNA, which serves as the main driver of centrosomal co-localization. The cen transcript undergoes localized translation in proximity to centrosomes, and its localization is perturbed by polysome-disrupting drugs. By interrogating global fractionation-sequencing datasets generated from Drosophila and human cellular models, we find that RNAs expressed as cis-NATs tend to co-localize to specific subcellular fractions. This work suggests that post-transcriptional interactions between RNAs with complementary sequences can dictate their localization fate in the cytoplasm."	0

However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn's disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders."	1

"32675286"	"Inhibition of the ATR kinase enhances 5-FU sensitivity independently of nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair pathways.The anticancer agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is cytotoxic and often used to treat various cancers. 5-FU is thought to inhibit the enzyme thymidylate synthase, which plays a role in nucleotide synthesis and has been found to induce single- and double-strand DNA breaks. ATR Ser/Thr kinase (ATR) is a principal kinase in the DNA damage response and is activated in response to UV- and chemotherapeutic drug-induced DNA replication stress, but its role in cellular responses to 5-FU is unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of ATR inhibition on 5-FU sensitivity of mammalian cells. Using immunoblotting, we found that 5-FU treatment dose-dependently induced the phosphorylation of ATR at the autophosphorylation site Thr-1989 and thereby activated its kinase. Administration of 5-FU with a specific ATR inhibitor remarkably decreased cell survival, compared with 5-FU treatment combined with other major DNA repair kinase inhibitors. Of note, the ATR inhibition enhanced induction of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in 5-FU-treated cells. Using gene expression analysis, we found that 5-FU induced the activation of the intra-S cell-cycle checkpoint. Cells lacking <i>BRCA2</i> were sensitive to 5-FU in the presence of ATR inhibitor. Moreover, ATR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of the 5-FU treatment, independently of the nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair pathways.

We find that the onset of plasma cell development is concomitant with a decline in remote genomic interactions; a gain in euchromatic character at loci encoding for factors that specify plasma cell fate, including Prdm1 and Atf4; and establishment of de novo inter-chromosomal hubs. We find that, in developing plasma cells and concurrent with transcriptional silencing, the Ebf1 locus repositions from an euchromatic to peri-centromeric heterochromatic environment. Finally, we find that inter-chromosomal hubs are enriched for the deposition of either H3K27Ac or H3K27me3.

Drugs targeting L- and other enteroendocrine cells are under development, with the aim to mimic endocrine effects of gastric bypass surgery, but they are difficult to develop without human L-cell models. Human ileal organoids, engineered by CRISPR-Cas9, express the fluorescent protein Venus in the proglucagon locus, enabling maintenance of live, identifiable human L-cells in culture. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified organoid-derived L-cells, analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), express hormones, receptors, and ion channels, largely typical of their murine counterparts. L-cells are electrically active and exhibit membrane depolarization and calcium elevations in response to G-protein-coupled receptor ligands. Organoids secrete hormones in response to glucose and other stimuli. The ability to label and maintain human L-cells in organoid culture opens avenues to explore L-cell function and develop drugs targeting the human enteroendocrine system."	0
"32231306"	"RNA helicase DDX21 mediates nucleotide stress responses in neural crest and melanoma cells.The availability of nucleotides has a direct impact on transcription. The inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with leflunomide impacts nucleotide pools by reducing pyrimidine levels. Leflunomide abrogates the effective transcription elongation of genes required for neural crest development and melanoma growth in vivo<sup>1</sup>. To define the mechanism of action, we undertook an in vivo chemical suppressor screen for restoration of neural crest after leflunomide treatment. Surprisingly, we found that alterations in progesterone and progesterone receptor (Pgr) signalling strongly suppressed leflunomide-mediated neural crest effects in zebrafish. In addition, progesterone bypasses the transcriptional elongation block resulting from Paf complex deficiency, rescuing neural crest defects in ctr9 morphant and paf1(aln<sup>z24</sup>) mutant embryos. Using proteomics, we found that Pgr binds the RNA helicase protein Ddx21. ddx21-deficient zebrafish show resistance to leflunomide-induced stress. At a molecular level, nucleotide depletion reduced the chromatin occupancy of DDX21 in human A375 melanoma cells. Nucleotide supplementation reversed the gene expression signature and DDX21 occupancy changes prompted by leflunomide. Together, our results show that DDX21 acts as a sensor and mediator of transcription during nucleotide stress."	0
"32668247"	"Zinc Finger Protein St18 Protects against Septic Death by Inhibiting VEGF-A from Macrophages.Zinc finger protein St18 was initially reported as candidate tumor suppressor gene, and also suggested that fibroblast St18 positively regulates NF-κB activation. Despite the pleiotropic functions of St18, little is known about its roles in macrophages. Here, we report that myeloid St18 is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A. Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation. Mechanistically, St18 directly binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A. Using mouse genetic and pharmacological models, we reveal myeloid St18 as a critical septic death protector."	1

In this study, we report that the expression of MED16 is markedly decreased in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) tumors compared with normal thyroid tissues. <i>In vitro</i>, MED16 overexpression in PTC cells significantly inhibited cell migration, enhanced sodium/iodide symporter expression and iodine uptake, and decreased resistance to radioactive <sup>131</sup>I (RAI). Conversely, PTC cells in which MED16 had been further knocked down (MED16<sup>KD</sup>) exhibited enhanced cell migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and RAI resistance, accompanied by decreased sodium/iodide symporter levels. Moreover, cell signaling through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) was highly activated after the MED16 knockdown. Similar results were obtained in MED12<sup>KD</sup> PTC cells, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment verified interactions between MED16 and MED12 and between MED16 and TGF-βR2. Of note, the application of LY2157299, a potent inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, significantly attenuated MED16<sup>KD</sup>-induced RAI resistance both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> In conclusion, our findings indicate that MED16 reduction in PTC contributes to tumor progression and RAI resistance via the activation of the TGF-β pathway."	1
"32442398"	"A Mechanism for microRNA Arm Switching Regulated by Uridylation.Strand selection is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Although the dominant strand may change depending on cellular contexts, the molecular mechanism and physiological significance of such alternative strand selection (or ""arm switching"") remain elusive. Here we find miR-324 to be one of the strongly regulated miRNAs by arm switching and identify the terminal uridylyl transferases TUT4 and TUT7 to be the key regulators. Uridylation of pre-miR-324 by TUT4/7 re-positions DICER on the pre-miRNA and shifts the cleavage site. This alternative processing produces a duplex with a different terminus from which the 3' strand (3p) is selected instead of the 5' strand (5p). In glioblastoma, the TUT4/7 and 3p levels are upregulated, whereas the 5p level is reduced. Manipulation of the strand ratio is sufficient to impair glioblastoma cell proliferation. This study uncovers a role of uridylation as a molecular switch in alternative strand selection and implicates its therapeutic potential."	0

ANK3 variants (encoding ankyrin-G) are associated with bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, while mutations in USP9X, which encodes a deubiquitinase, are associated with X-linked intellectual disability and autism in humans. Here, we show that TGF-β signaling promotes Usp9X phosphorylation, which enhances its interaction with ankyrin-G and stabilizes ankyrin-G in spines, leading to spine enlargement. Using in situ proximity ligation combined with structured illumination superresolution microscopy, we characterize the postsynaptic spatial organization of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Usp9X/ankyrin-G interactions in dendrites and its quantitative relationship with spine morphology and number. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism regulating protein stability in spines and suggest a role for deubiquitination and TGF-β signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis and treatment."	1
"31253574"	"Structural Basis of BRCC36 Function in DNA Repair and Immune Regulation.In mammals, ∼100 deubiquitinases act on ∼20,000 intracellular ubiquitination sites. Deubiquitinases are commonly regarded as constitutively active, with limited regulatory and targeting capacity. The BRCA1-A and BRISC complexes serve in DNA double-strand break repair and immune signaling and contain the lysine-63 linkage-specific BRCC36 subunit that is functionalized by scaffold subunits ABRAXAS and ABRO1, respectively. The molecular basis underlying BRCA1-A and BRISC function is currently unknown. Here we show that in the BRCA1-A complex structure, ABRAXAS integrates the DNA repair protein RAP80 and provides a high-affinity binding site that sequesters the tumor suppressor BRCA1 away from the break site. In the BRISC structure, ABRO1 binds SHMT2α, a metabolic enzyme enabling cancer growth in hypoxic environments, which we find prevents BRCC36 from binding and cleaving ubiquitin chains. Our work explains modularity in the BRCC36 DUB family, with different adaptor subunits conferring diversified targeting and regulatory functions."	0

However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in human cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene <i>RAB39b</i> are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain remain unknown. We generated <i>Rab39b</i> knockout (KO) mice and found that they exhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD behaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human cerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation and impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble neurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b interacts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly enhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely detectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling rescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by <i>RAB39b</i> mutations. Therefore, <i>RAB39b</i> mutation promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity and alters cortical neurogenesis, leading to macrocephaly and autistic-like behaviors. Our studies provide new insights into neurodevelopmental dysregulation and common pathways associated with ASD across species."	1
"32049003"	"A Requirement for Argonaute 4 in Mammalian Antiviral Defense.While interferon (IFN) responses are critical for mammalian antiviral defense, induction of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) is evident. To date, individual functions of the mammalian RNAi and micro RNA (miRNA) effector proteins Argonautes 1-4 (AGO1-AGO4) during virus infection remain undetermined. AGO2 was recently implicated in mammalian antiviral defense, so we examined antiviral activity of AGO1, AGO3, or AGO4 in IFN-competent immune cells. Only AGO4-deficient cells are hyper-susceptible to virus infection. AGO4 antiviral function is both IFN dependent and IFN independent, since AGO4 promotes IFN but also maintains antiviral capacity following prevention of IFN signaling or production. We identified AGO-loaded virus-derived short interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs), a molecular marker of antiviral RNAi, in macrophages infected with influenza or influenza lacking the IFN and RNAi suppressor NS1, which are uniquely diminished without AGO4. Importantly, AGO4-deficient influenza-infected mice have significantly higher burden and viral titers in vivo. Together, our data assign an essential role for AGO4 in mammalian antiviral defense."	0
"31914393"	"TACC3 Regulates Microtubule Plus-End Dynamics and Cargo Transport in Interphase Cells.End-binding proteins (EBs) are widely viewed as master regulators of microtubule dynamics and function. Here, we show that while EB1 mediates the dynamic microtubule capture of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in fibroblasts, in neuronal cells, infection occurs independently of EBs through stable microtubules. Prompted by this, we find that transforming acid coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), widely studied in mitotic spindle formation, regulates the cytoplasmic localization of the microtubule polymerizing factor chTOG and influences microtubule plus-end dynamics during interphase to control infection in distinct cell types. Furthermore, perturbing TACC3 function in neuronal cells resulted in the formation of disorganized stable, detyrosinated microtubule networks and changes in cellular morphology, as well as impaired trafficking of both HSV-1 and transferrin. These trafficking defects in TACC3-depleted cells were reversed by the depletion of kinesin-1 heavy chains. As such, TACC3 is a critical regulator of interphase microtubule dynamics and stability that influences kinesin-1-based cargo trafficking."	0
"32492416"	"CTTNBP2 Controls Synaptic Expression of Zinc-Related Autism-Associated Proteins and Regulates Synapse Formation and Autism-like Behaviors.Synaptic dysregulation is a critical feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Among various autism-associated genes, cortactin binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2) is a cytoskeleton regulator predominantly expressed in neurons and highly enriched at dendritic spines. Here, using Cttnbp2 knockout and ASD-linked mutant mice, we demonstrate that Cttnbp2 deficiency reduces zinc levels in the brain, alters synaptic protein targeting, impairs dendritic spine formation and ultrastructure of postsynaptic density, and influences neuronal activation and autism-like behaviors. A link to autism, the NMDAR-SHANK pathway, and zinc-related regulation are three features shared by CTTNBP2-regulated synaptic proteins. Zinc supplementation rescues the synaptic expression of CTTNBP2-regulated proteins. Moreover, zinc supplementation and administration of D-cycloserine, an NMDAR coagonist, improve the social behaviors of Cttnbp2-deficient mice. We suggest that CTTNBP2 controls the synaptic expression of a set of zinc-regulated autism-associated genes and influences NMDAR function and signaling, providing an example of how genetic and environmental factor crosstalk controls social behaviors."	0

"30686592"	"High-Resolution Ribosome Profiling Defines Discrete Ribosome Elongation States and Translational Regulation during Cellular Stress.Ribosomes undergo substantial conformational changes during translation elongation to accommodate incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs and translocate along the mRNA template. We used multiple elongation inhibitors and chemical probing to define ribosome conformational states corresponding to differently sized ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) generated by ribosome profiling. We show, using various genetic and environmental perturbations, that short 20-22 or classical 27-29 nucleotide RPFs correspond to ribosomes with open or occupied ribosomal A sites, respectively. These distinct states of translation elongation are readily discerned by ribosome profiling in all eukaryotes we tested, including fungi, worms, and mammals. This high-resolution ribosome profiling approach reveals mechanisms of translation-elongation arrest during distinct stress conditions. Hyperosmotic stress inhibits translocation through Rck2-dependent eEF2 phosphorylation, whereas oxidative stress traps ribosomes in a pre-translocation state, independent of Rck2-driven eEF2 phosphorylation. These results provide insights and approaches for defining the molecular events that impact translation elongation throughout biology."	0
"32433962"	"Pronuclear Microinjection during S-Phase Increases the Efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9-Assisted Knockin of Large DNA Donors in Mouse Zygotes.In CRISPR-Cas9-assisted knockin (KI) in zygotes, a remaining challenge is routinely achieving high-efficiency KI of large (kilobase-sized) DNA elements. Here, we focus on the timing of pronuclear injection and establish a reliable homologous recombination (HR)-based method to generate large KIs in zygotes compared with two other types of KI strategies involving distinct DNA repair pathways. At the ROSA26 locus, pronuclear injection with CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), and Cas9 protein at the S phase by using the HR-based method yields the most efficient and accurate KIs (up to 70%). This approach is also generally effective for generating large KI alleles at other gene loci. We further apply our method to efficiently obtain biallelic ROSA26 KIs by sequential injection into both pronuclei. Our results suggest that delivery of genome editing components and donor DNA into S-phase zygotes is critical for efficient KI of large DNA elements."	0
"32783950"	"Limits and Constraints on Mechanisms of Cell-Cycle Regulation Imposed by Cell Size-Homeostasis Measurements.High-throughput imaging has led to an explosion of observations about cell-size homeostasis across the kingdoms of life. Among bacteria, ""adder"" behavior-in which a constant size increment appears to be added during each cell cycle-is ubiquitous, while various eukaryotes show other size-homeostasis behaviors. Since interactions between cell-cycle progression and growth ultimately determine such behaviors, we developed a general model of cell-cycle regulation. Our analyses reveal a range of scenarios that are plausible but fail to regulate cell size, indicating that mechanisms of cell-cycle regulation are stringently limited by size-control requirements, and possibly why certain cell-cycle features are strongly conserved. Cell-cycle features can play unintuitive roles in altering size-homeostasis behaviors: noisy regulator production can enhance adder behavior, while Whi5-like inhibitor dilutors respond sensitively to perturbations to G2/M control and noisy G1/S checkpoints. Our model thus provides holistic insights into the mechanistic implications of size-homeostasis experimental measurements."	0
"31447390"	"SLX4IP Antagonizes Promiscuous BLM Activity during ALT Maintenance.Cancer cells acquire unlimited proliferative capacity by either re-expressing telomerase or inducing alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which relies on telomere recombination. Here, we show that ALT recombination requires coordinate regulation of the SMX and BTR complexes to ensure the appropriate balance of resolution and dissolution activities at recombining telomeres. Critical to this control is SLX4IP, which accumulates at ALT telomeres and interacts with SLX4, XPF, and BLM. Loss of SLX4IP increases ALT-related phenotypes, which is incompatible with cell growth following concomitant loss of SLX4. Inactivation of BLM is sufficient to rescue telomere aggregation and the synthetic growth defect in this context, suggesting that SLX4IP favors SMX-dependent resolution by antagonizing promiscuous BLM activity during ALT recombination. Finally, we show that SLX4IP is inactivated in a subset of ALT-positive osteosarcomas. Collectively, our findings uncover an SLX4IP-dependent regulatory mechanism critical for telomere maintenance in ALT cancer cells."	0

Here, we uncover a list of hyperacetylated proteins in the context of acutely reduced Acetyl-CoA levels under nutrient starvation. PHF5A, a component of U2 snRNPs, can be acetylated at lysine 29 in response to multiple cellular stresses, which is dependent on p300. PHF5A acetylation strengthens the interaction among U2 snRNPs and affects global pre-mRNA splicing pattern and extensive gene expression. PHF5A hyperacetylation-induced alternative splicing stabilizes KDM3A mRNA and promotes its protein expression. Pathologically, PHF5A K29 hyperacetylation and KDM3A upregulation axis are correlated with poor prognosis of colon cancer. Our findings uncover a mechanism of an anti-stress pathway through which acetylation on PHF5A promotes the cancer cells' capacity for stress resistance and consequently contributes to colon carcinogenesis."	1
"32846120"	"Influenza-Induced Oxidative Stress Sensitizes Lung Cells to Bacterial-Toxin-Mediated Necroptosis.Pneumonias caused by influenza A virus (IAV) co- and secondary bacterial infections are characterized by their severity and high mortality rate. Previously, we have shown that bacterial pore-forming toxin (PFT)-mediated necroptosis is a key driver of acute lung injury during bacterial pneumonia. Here, we evaluate the impact of IAV on PFT-induced acute lung injury during co- and secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) infection. We observe that IAV synergistically sensitizes lung epithelial cells for PFT-mediated necroptosis in vitro and in murine models of Spn co-infection and secondary infection. Pharmacoelogical induction of oxidative stress without virus sensitizes cells for PFT-mediated necroptosis. Antioxidant treatment or inhibition of necroptosis reduces disease severity during secondary bacterial infection. Our results advance our understanding on the molecular basis of co- and secondary bacterial infection to influenza and identify necroptosis inhibition and antioxidant therapy as potential intervention strategies."	0

Endocardial cells lining the interior of the heart are sensitive to these stimuli and respond by rearranging into luminal cells subjected to shear stress and abluminal cells not exposed to it. The mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense these dynamic biomechanical stimuli and how they evoke different cellular responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that blood flow activates two parallel mechanosensitive pathways, one mediated by Notch and the other by Klf2a. Both pathways negatively regulate the angiogenesis receptor Vegfr3/Flt4, which becomes restricted to abluminal endocardial cells. Its loss disrupts valve morphogenesis and results in the occurrence of Notch signaling within abluminal endocardial cells. Our work explains how antagonistic activities by Vegfr3/Flt4 on the abluminal side and by Notch on the luminal side shape cardiac valve leaflets by triggering unique differences in the fates of endocardial cells."	1
"31668496"	"The NADH Dehydrogenase Nde1 Executes Cell Death after Integrating Signals from Metabolism and Proteostasis on the Mitochondrial Surface.The proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to gain a global overview of mitochondrial protein turnover in yeast cells. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally high turnover of the NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor, AIF, forms two distinct topomers in mitochondria, one residing in the intermembrane space while the other spans the outer membrane and is exposed to the cytosol. The surface-exposed topomer triggers cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome/Cdc48 system and the mitochondrial protease Yme1; however, it is strongly enriched in respiratory-deficient cells.

"31676231"	"Recognition of Histone Crotonylation by Taf14 Links Metabolic State to Gene Expression.Metabolic signaling to chromatin often underlies how adaptive transcriptional responses are controlled. While intermediary metabolites serve as co-factors for histone-modifying enzymes during metabolic flux, how these modifications contribute to transcriptional responses is poorly understood. Here, we utilize the highly synchronized yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) and find that fatty acid β-oxidation genes are periodically expressed coincident with the β-oxidation byproduct histone crotonylation. Specifically, we found that H3K9 crotonylation peaks when H3K9 acetylation declines and energy resources become limited. During this metabolic state, pro-growth gene expression is dampened; however, mutation of the Taf14 YEATS domain, a H3K9 crotonylation reader, results in de-repression of these genes. Conversely, exogenous addition of crotonic acid results in increased histone crotonylation, constitutive repression of pro-growth genes, and disrupted YMC oscillations. Together, our findings expose an unexpected link between metabolic flux and transcription and demonstrate that histone crotonylation and Taf14 participate in the repression of energy-demanding gene expression."	0

Single-domain antibodies (VHH) have been examined as a countermeasure for BoNT because of their high stability and ease of production. Here, we investigate the structures and the neutralization mechanisms for six unique VHHs targeting BoNT/A1 or BoNT/B1. These studies reveal diverse neutralizing mechanisms by which VHHs prevent host receptor binding or block transmembrane delivery of the BoNT protease domain. Guided by this knowledge, we design heterodimeric VHHs by connecting two neutralizing VHHs via a flexible spacer so they can bind simultaneously to the toxin. These bifunctional VHHs display much greater potency in a mouse co-intoxication model than similar heterodimers unable to bind simultaneously. Taken together, our studies offer insight into antibody neutralization of BoNTs and advance our ability to design multivalent anti-pathogen VHHs with improved therapeutic properties."	0
"31128943"	"RNA Targets Ribogenesis Factor WDR43 to Chromatin for Transcription and Pluripotency Control.Transcription regulation underlies stem cell function and development. Here, we elucidate an unexpected role of an essential ribogenesis factor, WDR43, as a chromatin-associated RNA-binding protein (RBP) and release factor in modulating the polymerase (Pol) II activity for pluripotency regulation. WDR43 binds prominently to promoter-associated noncoding/nascent RNAs, occupies thousands of gene promoters and enhancers, and interacts with the Pol II machinery in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Nascent transcripts and transcription recruit WDR43 to active promoters, where WDR43 facilitates releases of the elongation factor P-TEFb and paused Pol II. Knockdown of WDR43 causes genome-wide defects in Pol II release and pluripotency-associated gene expression. Importantly, auxin-mediated rapid degradation of WDR43 drastically reduces Pol II activity, precluding indirect consequences. These results reveal an RNA-mediated recruitment and feedforward regulation on transcription and demonstrate an unforeseen role of an RBP in promoting Pol II elongation and coordinating high-level transcription and translation in ESC pluripotency."	0

To this end, we manipulated a major mechanism of glial intercellular communication that requires connexin-43 and assessed the effects on acute and chronic inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and immune responses. Deleting connexin-43 in glia protected against the development of visceral hypersensitivity following chronic colitis. Mechanistically, the protective effects of glial manipulation were mediated by disrupting the glial-mediated activation of macrophages through the macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

"30415948"	"A Nucleosome Bridging Mechanism for Activation of a Maintenance DNA Methyltransferase.DNA methylation and H3K9me are hallmarks of heterochromatin in plants and mammals, and are successfully maintained across generations. The biochemical and structural basis for this maintenance is poorly understood. The maintenance DNA methyltransferase from Zea mays, ZMET2, recognizes dimethylation of H3K9 via a chromodomain (CD) and a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain, which flank the catalytic domain. Here, we show that dinucleosomes are the preferred ZMET2 substrate, with DNA methylation preferentially targeted to linker DNA. Electron microscopy shows one ZMET2 molecule bridging two nucleosomes within a dinucleosome. We find that the CD stabilizes binding, whereas the BAH domain enables allosteric activation by the H3K9me mark. ZMET2 further couples recognition of H3K9me to an increase in the specificity for hemimethylated versus unmethylated DNA. We propose a model in which synergistic coupling between recognition of nucleosome spacing, H3K9 methylation, and DNA modification allows ZMET2 to maintain DNA methylation in heterochromatin with high fidelity."	0
"30902546"	"Gene-Specific H1 Eviction through a Transcriptional Activator→p300→NAP1→H1 Pathway.Linker histone H1 has been correlated with transcriptional inhibition, but the mechanistic basis of the inhibition and its reversal during gene activation has remained enigmatic. We report that H1-compacted chromatin, reconstituted in vitro, blocks transcription by abrogating core histone modifications by p300 but not activator and p300 binding. Transcription from H1-bound chromatin is elicited by the H1 chaperone NAP1, which is recruited in a gene-specific manner through direct interactions with activator-bound p300 that facilitate core histone acetylation (by p300) and concomitant eviction of H1 and H2A-H2B. An analysis in B cells confirms the strong dependency on NAP1-mediated H1 eviction for induction of the silent CD40 gene and further demonstrates that H1 eviction, seeded by activator-p300-NAP1-H1 interactions, is propagated over a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-demarcated region through a distinct mechanism that also involves NAP1. Our results confirm direct transcriptional inhibition by H1 and establish a gene-specific H1 eviction mechanism through an activator→p300→NAP1→H1 pathway."	0
"32571874"	"The bacterial copper resistance protein CopG contains a cysteine-bridged tetranuclear copper cluster.CopG is an uncharacterized protein ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria whose gene frequently occurs in clusters of copper resistance genes and can be recognized by the presence of a conserved CxCC motif. To investigate its contribution to copper resistance, here we undertook a structural and biochemical characterization of the CopG protein from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Results from biochemical analyses of CopG purified under aerobic conditions indicate that it is a green copper-binding protein that displays absorbance maxima near 411, 581, and 721 nm and is monomeric in solution. Determination of the three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography revealed that CopG consists of a thioredoxin domain with a C-terminal extension that contributes to metal binding. We noted that adjacent to the CxCC motif is a cluster of four copper ions bridged by cysteine sulfur atoms. Structures of CopG in two oxidation states support the assignment of this protein as an oxidoreductase. On the basis of these structural and spectroscopic findings and also genetic evidence, we propose that CopG has a role in interconverting Cu(I) and Cu(II) to minimize toxic effects and facilitate export by the Cus RND transporter efflux system."	0
"31995756"	"TAG-1 Multifunctionality Coordinates Neuronal Migration, Axon Guidance, and Fasciculation.Neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance need to be closely coordinated for neural circuit assembly. Spinal motor neurons (MNs) face unique challenges during development because their cell bodies reside within the central nervous system (CNS) and their axons project to various targets in the body periphery. The molecular mechanisms that contain MN somata within the spinal cord while allowing their axons to exit the CNS and navigate to their final destinations remain incompletely understood. We find that the MN cell surface protein TAG-1 anchors MN cell bodies in the spinal cord to prevent their emigration, mediates motor axon fasciculation during CNS exit, and guides motor axons past dorsal root ganglia. TAG-1 executes these varied functions in MN development independently of one another. Our results identify TAG-1 as a key multifunctional regulator of MN wiring that coordinates neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance."	0

To determine the composition of fragile particles, we introduce CUT&RUN.ChIP, in which targeted nuclease cleavage and release is followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that fragile particles represent the occupancy of the RSC (remodeling the structure of chromatin) nucleosome remodeling complex and RSC-bound, partially unwrapped nucleosomal intermediates. We also find that general regulatory factors (GRFs) bind to partially unwrapped nucleosomes at these promoters. We propose that RSC binding and its action cause nucleosomes to unravel, facilitate subsequent binding of GRFs, and constitute a dynamic cycle of nucleosome deposition and clearance at the subset of wide Pol II promoter NDRs."	0
"32402286"	"CCDC57 Cooperates with Microtubules and Microcephaly Protein CEP63 and Regulates Centriole Duplication and Mitotic Progression.Centrosomes function in key cellular processes ranging from cell division to cellular signaling. Their dysfunction is linked to cancer and developmental disorders. Here, we identify CCDC57 as a pleiotropic regulator of centriole duplication, mitosis, and ciliogenesis. Combining proximity mapping with superresolution imaging, we show that CCDC57 localizes to the proximal end of centrioles and interacts with the microcephaly protein CEP63, centriolar satellite proteins, and microtubules. Loss of CCDC57 causes defects in centriole duplication and results in a failure to localize CEP63 and CEP152 to the centrosome. Additionally, CCDC57 depletion perturbs mitotic progression both in wild-type and centriole-less cells. Importantly, its centrosome-targeting region is required for its interaction with CEP63 and functions during centriole duplication and cilium assembly, whereas the microtubule-targeting region is required for its mitotic functions. Together, our results identify CCDC57 as a critical interface between centrosome and microtubule-mediated cellular processes that are deregulated in microcephaly."	1
"32101742"	"The Non-dominant AAA+ Ring in the ClpAP Protease Functions as an Anti-stalling Motor to Accelerate Protein Unfolding and Translocation.ATP-powered unfoldases containing D1 and D2 AAA+ rings play important roles in protein homeostasis, but uncertainty about the function of each ring remains. Here we use single-molecule optical tweezers to assay mechanical unfolding and translocation by a variant of the ClpAP protease containing an ATPase-inactive D1 ring. This variant displays substantial mechanical defects in both unfolding and translocation of protein substrates. Notably, when D1 is hydrolytically inactive, ClpAP often stalls for times as long as minutes, and the substrate can back-slip through the enzyme when ATP concentrations are low. The inactive D1 variant also has more difficulty traveling in the N-to-C direction on a polypeptide track than it does moving in a C-to-N direction. These results indicate that D1 normally functions as an auxiliary/regulatory motor to promote uninterrupted enzyme advancement that is fueled largely by the D2 ring."	0
"32631954"	"Targeting all transforming growth factor-β isoforms with an Fc chimeric receptor impairs tumor growth and angiogenesis of oral squamous cell cancer.Tumor progression is governed by various growth factors and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Among these, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is secreted by various cell types residing in the TME and promotes tumor progression by inducing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis. TGF-β comprises three isoforms, TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, and transduces intracellular signals via TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). For the purpose of designing ligand traps that reduce oncogenic signaling in the TME, chimeric proteins comprising the ligand-interacting ectodomains of receptors fused with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin are often used. For example, chimeric soluble TβRII (TβRII-Fc) has been developed as an effective therapeutic strategy for targeting TGF-β ligands, but several lines of evidence indicate that TβRII-Fc more effectively traps TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 than TGF-β2, whose expression is elevated in multiple cancer types. In the present study, we developed a chimeric TGF-β receptor containing both TβRI and TβRII (TβRI-TβRII-Fc) and found that TβRI-TβRII-Fc trapped all TGF-β isoforms, leading to inhibition of both the TGF-β signal and TGF-β-induced EMT of oral cancer cells, whereas TβRII-Fc failed to trap TGF-β2. Furthermore, we found that TβRI-TβRII-Fc suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis more effectively than TβRII-Fc in a subcutaneous xenograft model of oral cancer cells with high TGF-β expression. These results suggest that TβRI-TβRII-Fc may be a promising tool for targeting all TGF-β isoforms in the TME."	0

"32571872"	"The RNA-binding protein PTBP1 promotes ATPase-dependent dissociation of the RNA helicase UPF1 to protect transcripts from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.The sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1) and HNRNP L (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L) protect mRNAs from nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) by preventing the UPF1 RNA helicase from associating with potential decay targets. Here, by analyzing <i>in vitro</i> helicase activity, dissociation of UPF1 from purified mRNPs, and transcriptome-wide UPF1 RNA binding, we present the mechanistic basis for inhibition of NMD by PTBP1. Unlike mechanisms of RNA stabilization that depend on direct competition for binding sites among protective RNA-binding proteins and decay factors, PTBP1 promotes displacement of UPF1 already bound to potential substrates. Our results show that PTBP1 directly exploits the tendency of UPF1 to release RNA upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. We further find that UPF1 sensitivity to PTBP1 is coordinated by a regulatory loop in domain 1B of UPF1. We propose that the UPF1 regulatory loop and protective proteins control kinetic proofreading of potential NMD substrates, presenting a new model for RNA helicase regulation and target selection in the NMD pathway."	0
"32482893"	"A-kinase-anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1)-based signaling complexes coordinate local protein synthesis at the mitochondrial surface.Compartmentalization of macromolecules is a ubiquitous molecular mechanism that drives numerous cellular functions. The appropriate organization of enzymes in space and time enables the precise transmission and integration of intracellular signals. Molecular scaffolds constrain signaling enzymes to influence the regional modulation of these physiological processes. Mitochondrial targeting of protein kinases and protein phosphatases provides a means to locally control the phosphorylation status and action of proteins on the surface of this organelle. Dual-specificity protein kinase A anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1) is a multivalent binding protein that targets protein kinase A (PKA), RNAs, and other signaling enzymes to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Many AKAPs recruit a diverse set of binding partners that coordinate a broad range of cellular processes. Here, results of MS and biochemical analyses reveal that dAKAP1 anchors additional components, including the ribonucleoprotein granule components La-related protein 4 (LARP4) and polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1). Local translation of mRNAs at organelles is a means to spatially control the synthesis of proteins. RNA-Seq data demonstrate that dAKAP1 binds mRNAs encoding proteins required for mitochondrial metabolism, including succinate dehydrogenase. Functional studies suggest that the loss of dAKAP1-RNA interactions reduces mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. Hence, dAKAP1 plays a previously unappreciated role as a molecular interface between second messenger signaling and local protein synthesis machinery."	1
"32348771"	"Intricate Genetic Programs Controlling Dormancy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) displays the remarkable ability to transition in and out of dormancy, a hallmark of the pathogen's capacity to evade the immune system and exploit susceptible individuals. Uncovering the gene regulatory programs that underlie the phenotypic shifts in MTB during disease latency and reactivation has posed a challenge. We develop an experimental system to precisely control dissolved oxygen levels in MTB cultures in order to capture the transcriptional events that unfold as MTB transitions into and out of hypoxia-induced dormancy. Using a comprehensive genome-wide transcription factor binding map and insights from network topology analysis, we identify regulatory circuits that deterministically drive sequential transitions across six transcriptionally and functionally distinct states encompassing more than three-fifths of the MTB genome. The architecture of the genetic programs explains the transcriptional dynamics underlying synchronous entry of cells into a dormant state that is primed to infect the host upon encountering favorable conditions."	0
"32877676"	"Distinct Signaling by Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamate, GABA, and Combinatorial Glutamate-GABA Neurons in Motivated Behavior.Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons play roles in reward and aversion. We recently discovered that the VTA has neurons that co-transmit glutamate and GABA (glutamate-GABA co-transmitting neurons), transmit glutamate without GABA (glutamate-transmitting neurons), or transmit GABA without glutamate (GABA-transmitting neurons). However, the functions of these VTA cell types in motivated behavior are unclear. To identify the functions of these VTA cell types, we combine recombinase mouse lines with INTRSECT2.0 vectors to selectively target these neurons. We find that VTA cell types have unique signaling patterns for reward, aversion, and learned cues. Whereas VTA glutamate-transmitting neurons signal cues predicting reward, VTA GABA-transmitting neurons signal cues predicting the absence of reward, and glutamate-GABA co-transmitting neurons signal rewarding and aversive outcomes without signaling learned cues related to those outcomes. Thus, we demonstrate that genetically defined subclasses of VTA glutamate and GABA neurons signal different aspects of motivated behavior."	0

Structures of these antibodies indicate diverse modes of Env recognition typified by antibodies of the PG9 class and the PGT145 class. The mode of recognition, however, has been unclear for the most potent of the V1V2 apex-targeting antibodies, CAP256-VRC26.25 (named for donor-lineage.clone and referred to hereafter as VRC26.25). Here, we determine the cryoelectron microscopy structure at 3.7 Å resolution of the antigen-binding fragment of VRC26.25 in complex with the Env trimer thought to have initiated the lineage. The 36-residue protruding loop of VRC26.25 displays recognition incorporating both strand-C interactions similar to the PG9 class and V1V2 apex insertion similar to the PGT145 class. Structural elements of separate antibody classes can thus intermingle to form a ""combined"" class, which in this case yields an antibody of extraordinary potency."	0

While influence of the CBC can extend into the cytoplasm, here we review the roles of the CBC in the nucleus, with a focus on protein-coding genes. We discuss differences between CBC function in yeast and mammals, covering the steps of transcription initiation, release of RNAPII from pausing, transcription elongation, cotranscriptional pre-mRNA splicing, transcription termination, and consequences of spurious transcription. We describe parameters known to control the binding of generic or gene-specific cofactors that regulate CBC activities depending on the process(es) targeted, illustrating how the CBC is an ever-changing choreographer of gene expression."	0
"30598363"	"RIPK1 and Caspase-8 Ensure Chromosome Stability Independently of Their Role in Cell Death and Inflammation.Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 functions as a key mediator of tissue homeostasis via formation of Caspase-8 activating ripoptosome complexes, positively and negatively regulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation. Here, we report an unanticipated cell-death- and inflammation-independent function of RIPK1 and Caspase-8, promoting faithful chromosome alignment in mitosis and thereby ensuring genome stability. We find that ripoptosome complexes progressively form as cells enter mitosis, peaking at metaphase and disassembling as cells exit mitosis. Genetic deletion and mitosis-specific inhibition of Ripk1 or Caspase-8 results in chromosome alignment defects independently of MLKL. We found that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited into mitotic ripoptosomes, where PLK1's activity is controlled via RIPK1-dependent recruitment and Caspase-8-mediated cleavage. A fine balance of ripoptosome assembly is required as deregulated ripoptosome activity modulates PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as BUBR1. Our data suggest that ripoptosome-mediated regulation of PLK1 contributes to faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis."	1
"31353207"	"C1QBP Promotes Homologous Recombination by Stabilizing MRE11 and Controlling the Assembly and Activation of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 Complex.MRE11 nuclease forms a trimeric complex (MRN) with RAD50 and NBS1 and plays a central role in preventing genomic instability. When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MRN is quickly recruited to the damage site and initiates DNA end resection; accordingly, MRE11 must be tightly regulated to avoid inefficient repair or nonspecific resection. Here, we show that MRE11 and RAD50 form a complex (MRC) with C1QBP, which stabilizes MRE11/RAD50, while inhibiting MRE11 nuclease activity by preventing its binding to DNA or chromatin. Upon DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates MRE11-S676/S678 to quickly dissociate the MRC complex. Either excess or insufficient C1QBP impedes the recruitment of MRE11 to DSBs and impairs the DNA damage response. C1QBP is highly expressed in breast cancer and positively correlates with MRE11 expression, and the inhibition of C1QBP enhances tumor regression with chemotherapy. By influencing MRE11 at multiple levels, C1QBP is, thus, an important player in the DNA damage response."	0
"32521276"	"Unique and Shared Roles for Histone H3K36 Methylation States in Transcription Regulation Functions.Set2 co-transcriptionally methylates lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36), producing mono-, di-, and trimethylation (H3K36me1/2/3). These modifications recruit or repel chromatin effector proteins important for transcriptional fidelity, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair. However, it was not known whether the different methylation states of H3K36 have distinct biological functions. Here, we use engineered forms of Set2 that produce different lysine methylation states to identify unique and shared functions for H3K36 modifications. Although H3K36me1/2 and H3K36me3 are functionally redundant in many SET2 deletion phenotypes, we found that H3K36me3 has a unique function related to Bur1 kinase activity and FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex function. Further, during nutrient stress, either H3K36me1/2 or H3K36me3 represses high levels of histone acetylation and cryptic transcription that arises from within genes. Our findings uncover the potential for the regulation of diverse chromatin functions by different H3K36 methylation states."	0
"31995754"	"Critical Role of Lipid Scramblase TMEM16F in Phosphatidylserine Exposure and Repair of Plasma Membrane after Pore Formation.Plasma membrane damage and cell death during processes such as necroptosis and apoptosis result from cues originating intracellularly. However, death caused by pore-forming agents, like bacterial toxins or complement, is due to direct external injury to the plasma membrane. To prevent death, the plasma membrane has an intrinsic repair ability. Here, we found that repair triggered by pore-forming agents involved TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase also mutated in Scott's syndrome. Upon pore formation and the subsequent influx of intracellular calcium, TMEM16F induced rapid ""lipid scrambling"" in the plasma membrane. This response was accompanied by membrane blebbing, extracellular vesicle release, preserved membrane integrity, and increased cell viability. TMEM16F-deficient mice exhibited compromised control of infection by Listeria monocytogenes associated with a greater sensitivity of neutrophils to the pore-forming Listeria toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). Thus, the lipid scramblase TMEM16F is critical for plasma membrane repair after injury by pore-forming agents."	0

Occasionally, mutations in ubiquitous general-purpose factors, including those affecting essential components of the DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) holoenzyme, have cell-type-specific consequences. POLE3, one of the four components of the POLE holoenzyme, features a histone fold domain and a unique acidic C terminus, making it a particularly attractive candidate mediating cell type-specific activities of POLE. Mice lacking Pole3 survive up to late embryonic stages, indicating that this subunit is dispensable for DNA replication. The phenotypes of viable hypomorphic and neomorphic alleles are surprisingly tissue restricted and reveal a stage-specific function of the histone fold domain of Pole3 during T and B cell development. Gradual introduction of positively charged residues into the acidic C terminus leads to peripheral lymphopenia of increasing severity. Our findings serve as a paradigm to understand the molecular basis of cell-type-specific non-replicative functions of the ubiquitous POLE complex."	0
"32375044"	"Distinct Roles of Mitochondrial HIGD1A and HIGD2A in Respiratory Complex and Supercomplex Biogenesis.The mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes are organized as individual complexes and supercomplexes, whose biogenesis remains to be fully understood. To disclose the role of the human Hypoxia Inducible Gene Domain family proteins HIGD1A and HIGD2A in these processes, we generate and characterize HIGD-knockout (KO) cell lines. We show that HIGD2A controls and coordinates the modular assembly of isolated and supercomplexed complex IV (CIV) by acting on the COX3 assembly module. In contrast, HIGD1A regulates CIII and CIII-containing supercomplex biogenesis by supporting the incorporation of UQCRFS1. HIGD1A also clusters with COX4-1 and COX5A CIV subunits and, when overexpressed, suppresses the CIV biogenesis defect of HIGD2A-KO cells. We conclude that HIGD1A and HIGD2A have both independent and overlapping functions in the biogenesis of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Our data illuminate the existence of multiple pathways to assemble these structures by dynamic HIGD-mediated CIV biogenesis, potentially to adapt to changing environmental and nutritional conditions."	0

In some cases, the intracellular environment has an impact on the mechanism, which might be missed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments. IR difference spectroscopy previously has been applied to study the light-induced response of photoreceptors and photoenzymes <i>in vitro</i> Here, we established the in-cell IR difference (ICIRD) spectroscopy in the transmission and attenuated total reflection configuration to investigate the light-induced response of soluble proteins in living bacterial cells. ICIRD spectroscopy on the light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains of the blue light receptors aureochrome and phototropin revealed a suppression of the response of specific secondary structure elements, indicating that the intracellular environment affects LOV photoreceptor mechanisms in general. Moreover, in-cell fluorescence spectroscopy disclosed that the intracellular environment slows down the recovery of the light-induced flavin adduct. Segment-resolved ICIRD spectroscopy on basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP)-LOV of aureochrome 1a from the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> indicated a signal progression from the LOV sensor to the bZIP effector independent of unfolding of the connecting A'α-helix, an observation that stood in contrast to <i>in vitro</i> results. This deviation was recapitulated <i>in vitro</i> by emulating the intracellular environment through the addition of the crowding agent BSA, but not by sucrose polymers. We conclude that ICIRD spectroscopy is a noninvasive, label-free approach for assessing conformational changes in receptors in living cells at ambient conditions. As demonstrated, these near-native responses may deviate from the mechanisms established under <i>in vitro</i> conditions."	0
"30709709"	"R-Loops Enhance Polycomb Repression at a Subset of Developmental Regulator Genes.R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that form during transcription, especially over unmethylated CpG-rich promoters of active genes. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), CpG-rich developmental regulator genes are repressed by the Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2. Here, we show that R-loops form at a subset of Polycomb target genes, and we investigate their contribution to Polycomb repression. At R-loop-positive genes, R-loop removal leads to decreased PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment and Pol II activation into a productive elongation state, accompanied by gene derepression at nascent and processed transcript levels. Stable removal of PRC2 derepresses R-loop-negative genes, as expected, but does not affect R-loops, PRC1 recruitment, or transcriptional repression of R-loop-positive genes. Our results highlight that Polycomb repression does not occur via one mechanism but consists of different layers of repression, some of which are gene specific. We uncover that one such mechanism is mediated by an interplay between R-loops and RING1B recruitment."	0
"32023459"	"Systematic Identification of Regulators of Oxidative Stress Reveals Non-canonical Roles for Peroxisomal Import and the Pentose Phosphate Pathway.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in metabolism and disease, yet a comprehensive analysis of the cellular response to oxidative stress is lacking. To systematically identify regulators of oxidative stress, we conducted genome-wide Cas9/CRISPR and shRNA screens. This revealed a detailed picture of diverse pathways that control oxidative stress response, ranging from the TCA cycle and DNA repair machineries to iron transport, trafficking, and metabolism. Paradoxically, disrupting the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at the level of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) protects cells against ROS. This dramatically alters metabolites in the PPP, consistent with rewiring of upper glycolysis to promote antioxidant production. In addition, disruption of peroxisomal import unexpectedly increases resistance to oxidative stress by altering the localization of catalase. Together, these studies provide insights into the roles of peroxisomal matrix import and the PPP in redox biology and represent a rich resource for understanding the cellular response to oxidative stress."	0

We find that FADS2 expression correlates with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity across multiple cancer types and is prognostic in some cancer types. Accordingly, activating mTOR signaling by deleting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) or overexpression of SREBP-1/2 is sufficient to increase FADS2 mRNA expression and sapienate metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and U87 glioblastoma cells, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR signaling decreases FADS2 expression and sapienate biosynthesis in MEFs with Tsc2 deletion, HUH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and orthotopic HUH7 liver xenografts. In conclusion, we show that mTOR signaling and SREBP activity are sufficient to activate sapienate metabolism by increasing FADS2 expression. Consequently, targeting mTOR signaling can reduce sapienate metabolism in vivo."	1

The B-repeat superdomain of Aap, composed of 5-17 B-repeats, each containing a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding G5 and a spacer subdomain, is responsible for Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent assembly leading to accumulation of bacteria during biofilm formation. We previously demonstrated that a minimal B-repeat construct (Brpt1.5) forms an antiparallel dimer in the presence of 2-3 Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. More recently, we have reported the presence of functional amyloid-like fibrils composed of Aap within <i>S. epidermidis</i> biofilms and demonstrated that a biologically relevant construct containing five and a half B-repeats (Brpt5.5) forms amyloid-like fibrils similar to those observed in the biofilm. In this study, we analyze the initial assembly events of the Brpt5.5 construct. Analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to determine hydrodynamic parameters of reversibly associating species and to perform linked equilibrium studies. Linkage studies indicated a mechanism of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced dimerization similar to smaller constructs; however, Brpt5.5 dimers could then undergo further Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced assembly into a previously uncharacterized tetramer. This led us to search for potential Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites outside of the dimer interface. We developed a Brpt5.5 mutant that was unable to form the tetramer and was concordantly incapable of amyloidogenesis. CD and dynamic light scattering indicate that a conformational transition in the tetramer species is a critical step preceding amyloidogenesis. This mechanistic model for B-repeat assembly and amyloidogenesis provides new avenues for potential therapeutic targeting of staphylococcal biofilms."	0
"32460026"	"Synthetic Lethality between DNA Polymerase Epsilon and RTEL1 in Metazoan DNA Replication.Genome stability requires coordination of DNA replication origin activation and replication fork progression. RTEL1 is a regulator of homologous recombination (HR) implicated in meiotic cross-over control and DNA repair in C. elegans. Through a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen, we uncovered an essential genetic interaction between RTEL1 and DNA polymerase (Pol) epsilon. Loss of POLE4, an accessory subunit of Pol epsilon, has no overt phenotype in worms. In contrast, the combined loss of POLE-4 and RTEL-1 results in embryonic lethality, accumulation of HR intermediates, genome instability, and cessation of DNA replication. Similarly, loss of Rtel1 in Pole4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse cells inhibits cellular proliferation, which is associated with persistent HR intermediates and incomplete DNA replication. We propose that RTEL1 facilitates genome-wide fork progression through its ability to metabolize DNA secondary structures that form during DNA replication. Loss of this function becomes incompatible with cell survival under conditions of reduced origin activation, such as Pol epsilon hypomorphy."	0

However, there is no consensus on how malaria impacts EBOV infection. The effect of acute Plasmodium infection on EBOV challenge was investigated using mouse-adapted EBOV and a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) model virus. We demonstrate that acute Plasmodium infection protects from lethal viral challenge, dependent upon interferon gamma (IFN-γ) elicited as a result of parasite infection. Plasmodium-infected mice lacking the IFN-γ receptor are not protected. Ex vivo incubation of naive human or mouse macrophages with sera from acutely parasitemic rodents or macaques programs a proinflammatory phenotype dependent on IFN-γ and renders cells resistant to EBOV infection. We conclude that acute Plasmodium infection can safeguard against EBOV by the production of protective IFN-γ. These findings have implications for anti-malaria therapies administered during episodic EBOV outbreaks in Africa."	0
"31836388"	"Paradoxical Role for Wild-Type p53 in Driving Therapy Resistance in Melanoma.Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease, despite recent improvements in therapy. Eradicating all melanoma cells even in drug-sensitive tumors is unsuccessful in patients because a subset of cells can transition to a slow-cycling state, rendering them resistant to most targeted therapy. It is still unclear what pathways define these subpopulations and promote this resistant phenotype. In the current study, we show that Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that drives a metastatic, therapy-resistant phenotype, stabilizes the half-life of p53 and uses p53 to initiate a slow-cycling state following stress (DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging). Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow-cycling phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibition. In vivo, this can be accomplished with a single dose of p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating wild-type p53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy."	0

However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions. Use of COPI provides effective prediction of gene activation potential and, more importantly, reveals a few developmental factors essential for mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation."	0

Here, we present an unexpected role of VDR in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis. Limited VDR expression is associated with impaired myeloid progenitor differentiation and is a new prognostic factor in AML. In mice, the lack of Vdr results in increased numbers of hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells and quiescent hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, malignant transformation of Vdr<sup>-/-</sup> cells results in myeloid differentiation block and increases self-renewal. Vdr promoter is methylated in AML as in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and demethylating agents induce VDR expression.

Similar phenotypic changes are observed outside the murine model when AIEC is grown in culture with PA as the sole carbon source; such PA exposure also results in AIEC that persists at 20-fold higher levels in vivo. RNA sequencing identifies an upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress response, metabolism, membrane integrity, and alternative carbon source utilization.

It is unclear if that silence requires minimum H3K27me3 levels and how the mark transmits faithfully across mammalian somatic cell generations. Mouse intestinal cells lacking EZH2 methyltransferase reduce H3K27me3 proportionately at all PRC2 target sites, but ∼40% uniform residual levels keep target genes inactive. These genes, derepressed in PRC2-null villus cells, remain silent in intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and computational modeling indicate that because unmodified histones dilute H3K27me3 by 50% each time DNA replicates, PRC2-deficient ISCs initially retain sufficient H3K27me3 to avoid gene derepression. EZH2 mutant human lymphoma cells also require multiple divisions before H3K27me3 dilution relieves gene silencing. In both cell types, promoters with high basal H3K4me2/3 activate in spite of some residual H3K27me3, compared to less-poised promoters.

Combining single-cell tracking and artificial niches ex vivo, we show how cells switch from ACDs to SCDs, suggesting that they are not engaged in an obligate mode of cell division. Further, we generated SNAP-tagged histone H3-reporter mice and find that, unlike fly germline stem cells, differential fate outcomes are associated with a symmetric distribution of the H3.1 and H3.3 histone variants in mouse muscle stem cells. This versatile and efficient H3-SNAP labeling system will allow an investigation of mechanisms underlying the maintenance of epigenomic identity and plasticity in a variety of tissues."	0
"31733992"	"An mTORC1-to-CDK1 Switch Maintains Autophagy Suppression during Mitosis.Since nuclear envelope breakdown occurs during mitosis in metazoan cells, it has been proposed that macroautophagy must be inhibited to maintain genome integrity. However, repression of macroautophagy during mitosis remains controversial and mechanistic detail limited to the suggestion that CDK1 phosphorylates VPS34. Here, we show that initiation of macroautophagy, measured by the translocation of the ULK complex to autophagic puncta, is repressed during mitosis, even when mTORC1 is inhibited. Indeed, mTORC1 is inactive during mitosis, reflecting its failure to localize to lysosomes due to CDK1-dependent RAPTOR phosphorylation. While mTORC1 normally represses autophagy via phosphorylation of ULK1, ATG13, ATG14, and TFEB, we show that the mitotic phosphorylation of these autophagy regulators, including at known repressive sites, is dependent on CDK1 but independent of mTOR. Thus, CDK1 substitutes for inhibited mTORC1 as the master regulator of macroautophagy during mitosis, uncoupling autophagy regulation from nutrient status to ensure repression of macroautophagy during mitosis."	1

"31919189"	"Upon microbial challenge, human neutrophils undergo rapid changes in nuclear architecture and chromatin folding to orchestrate an immediate inflammatory gene program.Differentiating neutrophils undergo large-scale changes in nuclear morphology. How such alterations in structure are established and modulated upon exposure to microbial agents is largely unknown. Here, we found that prior to encounter with bacteria, an armamentarium of inflammatory genes was positioned in a transcriptionally passive environment suppressing premature transcriptional activation. Upon microbial exposure, however, human neutrophils rapidly (<3 h) repositioned the ensemble of proinflammatory genes toward the transcriptionally permissive compartment. We show that the repositioning of genes was closely associated with the swift recruitment of cohesin across the inflammatory enhancer landscape, permitting an immediate transcriptional response upon bacterial exposure. We found that activated enhancers, marked by increased deposition of H3K27Ac, were highly enriched for cistromic elements associated with PU.1, CEBPB, TFE3, JUN, and FOSL2 occupancy. These data reveal how upon microbial challenge the cohesin machinery is recruited to an activated enhancer repertoire to instruct changes in chromatin folding, nuclear architecture, and to activate an inflammatory gene program."	0
"32273287"	"REDD1 loss reprograms lipid metabolism to drive progression of <i>RAS</i> mutant tumors.Human cancers with activating <i>RAS</i> mutations are typically highly aggressive and treatment-refractory, yet <i>RAS</i> mutation itself is insufficient for tumorigenesis, due in part to profound metabolic stress induced by RAS activation. Here we show that loss of REDD1, a stress-induced metabolic regulator, is sufficient to reprogram lipid metabolism and drive progression of <i>RAS</i> mutant cancers. <i>Redd1</i> deletion in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of KRAS-dependent pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas converts preneoplastic lesions into invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Metabolic profiling reveals that REDD1-deficient/<i>RAS</i> mutant cells exhibit enhanced uptake of lysophospholipids and lipid storage, coupled to augmented fatty acid oxidation that sustains both ATP levels and ROS-detoxifying NADPH. Mechanistically, REDD1 loss triggers HIF-dependent activation of a lipid storage pathway involving PPARγ and the prometastatic factor CD36. Correspondingly, decreased REDD1 expression and a signature of REDD1 loss predict poor outcomes selectively in <i>RAS</i> mutant but not <i>RAS</i> wild-type human lung and pancreas carcinomas. Collectively, our findings reveal the REDD1-mediated stress response as a novel tumor suppressor whose loss defines a <i>RAS</i> mutant tumor subset characterized by reprogramming of lipid metabolism, invasive and metastatic progression, and poor prognosis. This work thus provides new mechanistic and clinically relevant insights into the phenotypic heterogeneity and metabolic rewiring that underlies these common cancers."	0

The mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation and its contribution to SDH-deficient cancers remain undemonstrated. We examine the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and their correlation with RNA expression in SDHB-deficient tumors and murine Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup> cells. We report that DNA hypermethylation results from TET inhibition. Although it preferentially affects PRC2 targets and known developmental genes, PRC2 activity does not contribute to the DNA hypermethylator phenotype. We also prove, in vitro and in vivo, that TET silencing, although recapitulating the methylation profile of Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup> cells, is not sufficient to drive their EMT-like phenotype, which requires additional HIF2α activation. Altogether, our findings reveal synergistic roles of TET repression and pseudohypoxia in the acquisition of metastatic traits, providing a rationale for targeting HIF2α and DNA methylation in SDH-associated malignancies."	0
"32209466"	"An mRNA-mRNA Interaction Couples Expression of a Virulence Factor and Its Chaperone in Listeria monocytogenes.Bacterial pathogens often employ RNA regulatory elements located in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) to control gene expression. Using a comparative structural analysis, we examine the structure of 5' UTRs at a global scale in the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes under different conditions. In addition to discovering an RNA thermoswitch and detecting simultaneous interaction of ribosomes and small RNAs with mRNA, we identify structural changes in the 5' UTR of an mRNA encoding the post-translocation chaperone PrsA2 during infection conditions. We demonstrate that the 5' UTR of the prsA2 mRNA base pairs with the 3' UTR of the full-length hly mRNA encoding listeriolysin O, thus preventing RNase J1-mediated degradation of the prsA2 transcript. Mutants lacking the hly-prsA2 interaction exhibit reduced virulence properties. This work highlights an additional level of RNA regulation, where the mRNA encoding a chaperone is stabilized by the mRNA encoding its substrate."	0
"32482713"	"After the break: DSB end processing in mouse meiosis.The exchange of genetic information between parental chromosomes in meiosis is an integral process for the creation of gametes. To generate a crossover, hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are introduced in the genome of each meiotic cell by the SPO11 protein. The nucleolytic resection of DSB-adjacent DNA is a key step in meiotic DSB repair, but this process has remained understudied. In this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Yamada and colleagues (pp. 806-818) capture some of the first details of resection and DSB repair intermediates in mouse meiosis using a method that maps blunt-ended DNA after ssDNA digestion. This yields some of the first genome-wide insights into DSB resection and repair in a mammalian genome and offers a tantalizing glimpse of how to quantitatively dissect this difficult to study, yet integral, nuclear process."	0
"31400850"	"RAD51AP1 Is an Essential Mediator of Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres.Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism of telomere elongation that controls proliferation in aggressive cancers. We show that the disruption of RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) in ALT+ cancer cells leads to generational telomere shortening. This is due to RAD51AP1's involvement in RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) and RAD52-POLD3-dependent break induced DNA synthesis. RAD51AP1 KO ALT+ cells exhibit telomere dysfunction and cytosolic telomeric DNA fragments that are sensed by cGAS. Intriguingly, they activate ULK1-ATG7-dependent autophagy as a survival mechanism to mitigate DNA damage and apoptosis. Importantly, RAD51AP1 protein levels are elevated in ALT+ cells due to MMS21 associated SUMOylation. Mutation of a single SUMO-targeted lysine residue perturbs telomere dynamics. These findings indicate that RAD51AP1 is an essential mediator of the ALT mechanism and is co-opted by post-translational mechanisms to maintain telomere length and ensure proliferation of ALT+ cancer cells."	0
"32726636"	"GSK3 Inhibits Macropinocytosis and Lysosomal Activity through the Wnt Destruction Complex Machinery.Canonical Wnt signaling is emerging as a major regulator of endocytosis. Here, we report that Wnt-induced macropinocytosis is regulated through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the β-catenin destruction complex. We find that mutation of Axin1, a tumor suppressor and component of the destruction complex, results in the activation of macropinocytosis. Surprisingly, inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021, or dominant-negative GSK3 triggers macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition causes a rapid increase in acidic endolysosomes that is independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increases lysosomal activity, which can be followed with tracers of active cathepsin D, β-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation. Microinjection of LiCl into the blastula cavity of Xenopus embryos causes a striking increase in dextran macropinocytosis. The effects of GSK3 inhibition on protein degradation in endolysosomes are blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA or IPA-3, suggesting that increases in membrane trafficking drive lysosomal activity."	0
"32553153"	"Vitamin-D-Binding Protein Contributes to the Maintenance of α Cell Function and Glucagon Secretion.Vitamin-D-binding protein (DBP) or group-specific component of serum (GC-globulin) carries vitamin D metabolites from the circulation to target tissues. DBP is highly localized to the liver and pancreatic α cells. Although DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms, and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates α cell morphology, α cell function, and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP leads to smaller and hyperplastic α cells, altered Na<sup>+</sup> channel conductance, impaired α cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, this involves reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution. Defects are also seen in β cell and δ cell function. Immunostaining of human pancreata reveals generalized loss of DBP expression as a feature of late-onset and long-standing, but not early-onset, type 1 diabetes. Thus, DBP regulates α cell phenotype, with implications for diabetes pathogenesis."	0
"32645368"	"Systematic Discovery of Short Linear Motifs Decodes Calcineurin Phosphatase Signaling.Short linear motifs (SLiMs) drive dynamic protein-protein interactions essential for signaling, but sequence degeneracy and low binding affinities make them difficult to identify.

In vitro proteome-wide detection of CN-binding peptides, in vivo SLiM-dependent proximity labeling, and in silico modeling of motif determinants uncovered unanticipated CN interactors, including NOTCH1, which we establish as a CN substrate. Unexpectedly, CN shows SLiM-dependent proximity to centrosomal and nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins-structures where Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is largely uncharacterized. CN dephosphorylates human and yeast NPC proteins and promotes accumulation of a nuclear transport reporter, suggesting conserved NPC regulation by CN.

However, how active zones form is not known. Here, we show that RIM and RIM-BP, via specific multivalent bindings, form dynamic and condensed assemblies through liquid-liquid phase separation. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), via C-terminal-tail-mediated direct binding to both RIM and RIM-BP, can be enriched to the RIM and RIM-BP condensates. We further show that RIM and RIM-BP, together with VGCCs, form dense clusters on the supported lipid membrane bilayers via phase separation. Therefore, RIMs and RIM-BPs are plausible organizers of active zones, and the formation of RIM and RIM-BP condensates may cluster VGCCs into nano- or microdomains and position the clustered Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors on docked vesicles for efficient and precise synaptic transmissions."	0
"32294443"	"Blood Flow Limits Endothelial Cell Extrusion in the Zebrafish Dorsal Aorta.Blood flow modulates endothelial cell (EC) response during angiogenesis. Shear stress is known to control gene expression related to the endothelial-mesenchymal transition and endothelial-hematopoietic transition. However, the impact of blood flow on the cellular processes associated with EC extrusion is less well understood. To address this question, we dynamically record EC movements and use 3D quantitative methods to segregate the contributions of various cellular processes to the cellular trajectories in the zebrafish dorsal aorta. We find that ECs spread toward the cell extrusion area following the tissue deformation direction dictated by flow-derived mechanical forces. Cell extrusion increases when blood flow is impaired. Similarly, the mechanosensor polycystic kidney disease 2 (pkd2) limits cell extrusion, suggesting that ECs actively sense mechanical forces in the process. These findings identify pkd2 and flow as critical regulators of EC extrusion and suggest that mechanical forces coordinate this process by maintaining ECs within the endothelium."	0
"30581147"	"Bidirectional Control of Autophagy by BECN1 BARA Domain Dynamics.Membrane targeting of the BECN1-containing class III PI 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complexes is pivotal to the regulation of autophagy. The interaction of PI3KC3 complex II and its ubiquitously expressed inhibitor, Rubicon, was mapped to the first β sheet of the BECN1 BARA domain and the UVRAG BARA2 domain by hydrogen-deuterium exchange and cryo-EM. These data suggest that the BARA β sheet 1 unfolds to directly engage the membrane. This mechanism was confirmed using protein engineering, giant unilamellar vesicle assays, and molecular simulations. Using this mechanism, a BECN1 β sheet-1 derived peptide activates both PI3KC3 complexes I and II, while HIV-1 Nef inhibits complex II. These data reveal how BECN1 switches on and off PI3KC3 binding to membranes. The observations explain how PI3KC3 inhibition by Rubicon, activation by autophagy-inducing BECN1 peptides, and inhibition by HIV-1 Nef are mediated by the switchable ability of the BECN1 BARA domain to partially unfold and insert into membranes."	0

We assayed 27,733 variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) within or adjacent to 2,198 human exons in the MFASS minigene reporter and found that 3.8% (1,050) of variants, most of which are extremely rare, led to large-effect splice-disrupting variants (SDVs). Importantly, we find that 83% of SDVs are located outside of canonical splice sites, are distributed evenly across distinct exonic and intronic regions, and are difficult to predict a priori. Our results indicate extant, rare genetic variants can have large functional effects on splicing at appreciable rates, even outside the context of disease, and MFASS enables their empirical assessment at scale."	0

Here we show that hp can bind different motifs with high specificity. We identify a PxxPxF motif that is necessary for G2-cyclin Clb3 function in S. cerevisiae, and that mediates Clb3-Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ypr174c (proposed name: Cdc5 SPB anchor-Csa1) to regulate the localization of Polo kinase Cdc5. Similar motifs exist in other Clb3-Cdk1 targets. Our work completes the set of docking specificities for the four major cyclins: LP, RxL, PxxPxF, and LxF motifs for G1-, S-, G2-, and M-phase cyclins, respectively. Further, we show that variations in motifs can change their specificity for human cyclins. This diversity could provide complexity for the encoding of CDK thresholds to achieve ordered cell-cycle phosphorylation."	0
"32820038"	"Distinct kinesin motors drive two types of maize neocentromeres.A maize chromosome variant called abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10) converts knobs on chromosome arms into neocentromeres, causing their preferential segregation to egg cells in a process known as meiotic drive. We previously demonstrated that the gene <i>Kinesin driver</i> (<i>Kindr</i>) on Ab10 encodes a kinesin-14 required to mobilize neocentromeres made up of the major tandem repeat knob180. Here we describe a second kinesin-14 gene, <i>TR-1 kinesin</i> (<i>Trkin</i>), that is required to mobilize neocentromeres made up of the minor tandem repeat TR-1<i>. Trkin</i> lies in a 4-Mb region of Ab10 that is not syntenic with any other region of the maize genome and shows extraordinary sequence divergence from <i>Kindr</i> and other kinesins in plants. Despite its unusual structure, <i>Trkin</i> encodes a functional minus end-directed kinesin that specifically colocalizes with TR-1 in meiosis, forming long drawn out neocentromeres. TRKIN contains a nuclear localization signal and localizes to knobs earlier in prophase than KINDR. The fact that TR-1 repeats often co-occur with knob180 repeats suggests that the current role of the TRKIN/TR-1 system is to facilitate the meiotic drive of the KINDR/knob180 system."	0
"32645369"	"RNF126-Mediated Reubiquitination Is Required for Proteasomal Degradation of p97-Extracted Membrane Proteins.Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is an AAA-ATPase that extracts polyubiquitinated substrates from multimeric macromolecular complexes and biological membranes for proteasomal degradation. During p97-mediated extraction, the substrate is largely deubiquitinated as it is threaded through the p97 central pore. How p97-extracted substrates are targeted to the proteasome with few or no ubiquitins is unknown. Here, we report that p97-extracted membrane proteins undergo a second round of ubiquitination catalyzed by the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase RNF126. RNF126 interacts with transmembrane-domain-specific chaperone BAG6, which captures p97-liberated substrates. RNF126 depletion in cells diminishes the ubiquitination of extracted membrane proteins, slows down their turnover, and dramatically stabilizes otherwise transient intermediates in the cytosol. We reconstitute the reubiquitination of a p97-extracted, misfolded multispanning membrane protein with purified factors. Our results demonstrate that p97-extracted substrates need to rapidly engage ubiquitin ligase-chaperone pairs that rebuild the ubiquitin signal for proteasome targeting to prevent harmful accumulation of unfolded intermediates."	1

Genetic ablation of MST1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages potentiated the TNFα-induced increase in IκB kinase (IKK) activity, as well as the expression of NF-κB target genes. TNFα induced the recruitment of MST1 to TNF-RSC and its interaction with HOIP, the catalytic component of the E3 ligase linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC). Furthermore, MST1 activated in response to TNFα stimulation mediates the phosphorylation of HOIP and thereby inhibited LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ. Together, our findings suggest that MST1 negatively regulates TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling by targeting LUBAC."	1
"31862156"	"A Mechanism to Minimize Errors during Non-homologous End Joining.Enzymatic processing of DNA underlies all DNA repair, yet inappropriate DNA processing must be avoided. In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a ""short-range synaptic complex"" in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Our results illustrate how the coordination of enzymatic catalysis with higher-order structural organization of substrate maximizes the fidelity of DNA repair."	0

Afadin elimination in motor neuron progenitors results in striking locomotor behavior: left-right limb alternation is substituted by synchronous activation, characteristic of bound gait. We find that afadin function at the neuroepithelium is required for structural organization of the spinal midline and central canal morphogenesis. Perturbation of afadin results in formation of two central canals, aberrant contralateral wiring of different classes of spinal premotor interneurons, and loss of left-right limb alternation, highlighting important developmental principles controlling the assembly of spinal motor circuits."	0

We further established that protein aggresome-a collection of endogenous protein aggregates-is an important indicator of bacterial dormancy depth, whose formation is promoted by decreased cellular ATP level. For cells to leave the dormant state and resuscitate, clearance of protein aggresome and recovery of proteostasis are required. We revealed that the ability to recruit functional DnaK-ClpB machineries, which facilitate protein disaggregation in an ATP-dependent manner, determines the lag time for bacterial regrowth. Better understanding of the key factors regulating bacterial regrowth after surviving antibiotic attack could lead to new therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial antibiotic tolerance."	0

Here, we engineer living cells to tag glycans with editable chemical functionalities while providing information on biosynthesis, physiological context, and glycan fine structure. We introduce a non-natural substrate biosynthetic pathway and use engineered glycosyltransferases to incorporate chemically tagged sugars into the cell surface glycome of the living cell. We apply the strategy to a particularly redundant yet disease-relevant human glycosyltransferase family, the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases.

We identified and characterized a family of nuclear Argonaute-interacting proteins (ENRIs) that control the strength and target specificity of nuclear RNAi in C. elegans, ensuring faithful inheritance of epigenetic memories. ENRI-1/2 prevent misloading of the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 with small RNAs that normally effect maternal piRNAs, which prevents precocious nuclear translocation of NRDE-3 in the early embryo. Additionally, they are negative regulators of nuclear RNAi triggered from exogenous sources. Loss of ENRI-3, an unstable protein expressed mostly in the male germline, misdirects the RNAi response to transposable elements and impairs TEI. The ENRIs determine the potency and specificity of nuclear RNAi responses by gating small RNAs into specific nuclear Argonautes."	1

We demonstrate that monocyte-derived macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages) recruited into the airspace upregulate the anti-inflammatory function of alveolar macrophages by suppressing their stimulator of type 1 interferon gene (STING) signaling. Depletion of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages in mice (macrophage<sup>dep</sup> mice) after endotoxin or after Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes expansion of the inflammatory alveolar macrophage population, leading to neutrophil accumulation, irreversible loss of lung vascular barrier function, and lethality. We show that CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages suppress alveolar macrophage-STING signaling via sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Thus, adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) or STING<sup>-/-</sup>, but not SPHK2<sup>-/-</sup>, CD11b monocytes from murine bone marrow into injured macrophage<sup>dep</sup> mice rescue anti-inflammatory alveolar macrophages and reverse lung vascular injury. SPHK2-induced S1P generation in CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages has the potential to educate alveolar macrophages to resolve ALI."	0
"32877683"	"An Epilepsy-Associated GRIN2A Rare Variant Disrupts CaMKIIα Phosphorylation of GluN2A and NMDA Receptor Trafficking.Rare variants in GRIN genes, which encode NMDAR subunits, are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these, GRIN2A, which encodes the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, is widely accepted as an epilepsy-causative gene. Here, we functionally characterize the de novo GluN2A-S1459G mutation identified in an epilepsy patient. We show that S1459 is a CaMKIIα phosphorylation site, and that endogenous phosphorylation is regulated during development and in response to synaptic activity in a dark rearing model. GluN2A-S1459 phosphorylation results in preferential binding of NMDARs to SNX27 and a corresponding decrease in PSD-95 binding, which consequently regulates NMDAR trafficking. Furthermore, the epilepsy-associated GluN2A-S1459G variant displays defects in interactions with both SNX27 and PSD-95, resulting in trafficking deficits, reduced spine density, and decreased excitatory synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate a role for CaMKIIα phosphorylation of GluN2A in receptor targeting and implicate NMDAR trafficking defects as a link to epilepsy."	1
"32075767"	"Defective Mitochondrial Pyruvate Flux Affects Cell Bioenergetics in Alzheimer's Disease-Related Models.Mitochondria are key organelles for brain health. Mitochondrial alterations have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms appears crucial to understand their relationship with the pathology. Using multiple genetic, pharmacological, imaging, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that, in different familial AD cell models, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is affected. The defect depends on reduced mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, due to both lower Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated stimulation of the Krebs cycle and dampened mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Importantly, this latter event is linked to glycogen-synthase-kinase-3β (GSK-3β) hyper-activation, leading, in turn, to impaired recruitment of hexokinase 1 (HK1) to mitochondria, destabilization of mitochondrial-pyruvate-carrier (MPC) complexes, and decreased MPC2 protein levels. Remarkably, pharmacological GSK-3β inhibition in AD cells rescues MPC2 expression and improves mitochondrial ATP synthesis and respiration. The defective mitochondrial bioenergetics influences glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity, thus representing a possible target for future therapeutic interventions."	0

"32937118"	"The Dorsal Lateral Habenula-Interpeduncular Nucleus Pathway Is Essential for Left-Right-Dependent Decision Making in Zebrafish.How animals behave using suitable information to adapt to the environment is not well known. We address this issue by devising an automated system to let zebrafish exploit either internal (choice of left or right turn) or external (choice of cue color) navigation information to achieve operant behavior by reward reinforcement learning. The results of behavioral task with repeated rule shift indicate that zebrafish can learn operant behavior using both internal-directional and external-cued information. The learning time is reduced as rule shifts are repeated, revealing the capacity of zebrafish to adaptively retrieve the suitable rule memory after training. Zebrafish with an impairment in the neural pathway from the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus, known to be potentiated in the winners of social conflicts, show specific defects in the application of the internal-directional rule, suggesting the dual roles of this pathway."	0
"32755581"	"Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Supplementation Reverses the Declining Quality of Maternally Aged Oocytes.Advanced maternal age is highly associated with a decline in oocyte quality, but effective approaches to improve it have still not been fully determined. Here, we report that in vivo supplementation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) efficaciously improves the quality of oocytes from naturally aged mice by recovering nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) levels. NMN supplementation not only increases ovulation of aged oocytes but also enhances their meiotic competency and fertilization ability by maintaining the normal spindle/chromosome structure and the dynamics of the cortical granule component ovastacin. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the beneficial effect of NMN on aged oocytes is mediated by restoration of mitochondrial function, eliminating the accumulated ROS to suppress apoptosis. Collectively, our data reveal that NMN supplementation is a feasible approach to protect oocytes from advanced maternal age-related deterioration, contributing to the improvement of reproductive outcome of aged women and assisted reproductive technology."	0

Yet the protein structure domains that allow TFs to target nucleosomal DNA remain unexplored. We screened diverse TFs for binding to nucleosomes containing motif-enriched sequences targeted by pioneer factors in vivo. FOXA1, OCT4, ASCL1/E12α, PU1, CEBPα, and ZELDA display a range of nucleosome binding affinities that correlate with their cell reprogramming potential. We further screened 593 full-length human TFs on protein microarrays against different nucleosome sequences, followed by confirmation in solution, to distinguish among factors that bound nucleosomes, such as the neuronal AP-2α/β/γ, versus factors that only bound free DNA. Structural comparisons of DNA binding domains revealed that efficient nucleosome binders use short anchoring α helices to bind DNA, whereas weak nucleosome binders use unstructured regions and/or β sheets. Thus, specific modes of DNA interaction allow nucleosome scanning that confers pioneer activity to transcription factors."	0
"32817126"	"A protein folding intermediate pulls its weight.Proteins must acquire and maintain a specific fold to execute their biochemical function(s). In solution, unfolded proteins typically find this native structure through a biased sampling of preferred intermediate conformations. However, the initial search for these structures begins during protein synthesis, and it is unclear how much interactions between the ribosome and nascent polypeptide skew folding pathways. In this issue, Jensen and colleagues use a ribosomal force-profiling assay to show that RNase H forms a similar folding intermediate on and off the ribosome. In conjunction with measurements of the rate of RNase H unfolding on and off the ribosome, their results show that ribosomal interactions have little impact on the folding pathway of RNase H. These findings suggest that the ribosome itself does not necessarily rewire protein folding reactions."	0
"32905765"	"INO80C Remodeler Maintains Genomic Stability by Preventing Promiscuous Transcription at Replication Origins.The proper coordination of transcription with DNA replication and repair is central for genomic stability. We investigate how the INO80C chromatin remodeling enzyme might coordinate these genomic processes. We find that INO80C co-localizes with the origin recognition complex (ORC) at yeast replication origins and is bound to replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In yeast, INO80C recruitment requires origin sequences but does not require ORC, suggesting that recruitment is independent of pre-replication complex assembly. In both yeast and ESCs, INO80C co-localizes at origins with Mot1 and NC2 transcription factors, and genetic studies suggest that they function together to promote genome stability. Interestingly, nascent transcript sequencing demonstrates that INO80C and Mot1 prevent pervasive transcription through origin sequences, and absence of these factors leads to formation of new DNA double-strand breaks. We propose that INO80C and Mot1/NC2 function through distinct pathways to limit origin transcription, maintaining genomic stability."	0
"31606272"	"AUTACs: Cargo-Specific Degraders Using Selective Autophagy.Protein silencing represents an essential tool in biomedical research. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies exemplified by PROTACs are rapidly emerging as modalities in drug discovery. However, the scope of current TPD techniques is limited because many intracellular materials are not substrates of proteasomal clearance. Here, we described a novel targeted-clearance strategy (autophagy-targeting chimera [AUTAC]) that contains a degradation tag (guanine derivatives) and a warhead to provide target specificity. As expected from the substrate scope of autophagy, AUTAC degraded fragmented mitochondria as well as proteins. Mitochondria-targeted AUTAC accelerated both the removal of dysfunctional fragmented mitochondria and the biogenesis of functionally normal mitochondria in patient-derived fibroblast cells. Cytoprotective effects against acute mitochondrial injuries were also seen. Canonical autophagy is viewed as a nonselective bulk decomposition system, and none of the available autophagy-inducing agents exhibit useful cargo selectivity. With its target specificity, AUTAC provides a new modality for research on autophagy-based drugs."	0
"31914392"	"Thermosensitive Nucleosome Editing Reveals the Role of DNA Sequence in Targeted Histone Variant Deposition.In preparation for transcription, the chromatin remodeler SWR installs homotypic ZZ nucleosomes at promoters by replacing the two nucleosomal H2A with H2A.Z in a stepwise manner. Nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) help recruit SWR to promoters; this is thought to position SWR asymmetrically on one side of the +1 nucleosome. How SWR accesses the opposite side of +1 to generate a ZZ nucleosome remains unclear. Using biochemical assays that monitor the sub-nucleosomal position of nascent H2A.Z, we find that NFR-recruited SWR switches sides to insert H2A.Z into asymmetrically positioned nucleosomes; however, at decreasing temperatures, H2A.Z insertion becomes progressively biased for one side. We find that a 16-bp element containing G/C runs (>3 consecutive G or C nucleotides) is sufficient to promote H2A.Z insertion. Because H2A.Z-rich +1 nucleosomes in yeast have more G/C runs, we propose that nucleosome editing is a thermosensitive process that can be hard coded by the genome."	0
"32601373"	"Endocytic regulation of cellular ion homeostasis controls lysosome biogenesis.Lysosomes serve as cellular degradation and signalling centres that coordinate metabolism in response to intracellular cues and extracellular signals. Lysosomal capacity is adapted to cellular needs by transcription factors, such as TFEB and TFE3, which activate the expression of lysosomal and autophagy genes. Nuclear translocation and activation of TFEB are induced by a variety of conditions such as starvation, lysosome stress and lysosomal storage disorders. How these various cues are integrated remains incompletely understood. Here, we describe a pathway initiated at the plasma membrane that controls lysosome biogenesis via the endocytic regulation of intracellular ion homeostasis. This pathway is based on the exo-endocytosis of NHE7, a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger mutated in X-linked intellectual disability, and serves to control intracellular ion homeostasis and thereby Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calcineurin-mediated activation of TFEB and downstream lysosome biogenesis in response to osmotic stress to promote the turnover of toxic proteins and cell survival."	0
"32294433"	"Diverse CD8 T Cell Responses to Viral Infection Revealed by the Collaborative Cross.Enhanced host protection against re-infection requires generation of memory T cells of sufficient quantity and functional quality.

Thus, additional models are needed that accurately reflect variation in immune outcomes in genetically diverse populations and to uncover underlying genetic causes. The Collaborative Cross (CC), a large recombinant inbred panel of mice, is an ideal model in this pursuit for the high degree of genetic variation present, because it allows for assessment of genetic factors underlying unique phenotypes. Here, we advance the utility of the CC as a tool to analyze the immune response to viral infection. We describe variability in resting immune cell composition and adaptive immune responses generated among CC strains following systemic virus infection and reveal quantitative trait loci responsible for generation of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells."	0
"32521271"	"TLR7 Sensing by Neutrophils Is Critical for the Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, where they kill invading pathogens. However, they may also act as early temporary shelters, favoring subsequent pathogen dissemination in the host. We find that TLR7 sensing of the protozoan Leishmania parasite in neutrophils is essential for early parasite load regulation. Neutrophil effector functions, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, are decreased in the absence of TLR7, resulting in higher parasite load and selective parasite replication in Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils. Leishmania-infected Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> mice develop a chronic unhealing lesion, despite Th1 cell differentiation, and we show that Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils alone mediate this effect. Conversely, topical treatment with a TLR7 agonist early in infection induces smaller lesion development than in untreated mice. Collectively, these findings highlight that parasite TLR7 triggering in neutrophils regulates early innate functions with major consequences on subsequent disease evolution, opening avenues for possible treatment strategies."	0

The <i>Tex15</i> mutant exhibits DNA hypomethylation in TEs at a level similar to <i>Mili</i> and <i>Dnmt3c</i> but not <i>Miwi2</i> mutants. TEX15 is associated with MILI in testis. As loss of <i>Tex15</i> causes TE desilencing with intact piRNA production, our results identify TEX15 as a new essential epigenetic regulator that may function as a nuclear effector of MILI to silence TEs by DNA methylation."	1
"32402279"	"Systemic Type I IFN Inflammation in Human ISG15 Deficiency Leads to Necrotizing Skin Lesions.Most monogenic disorders have a primary clinical presentation. Inherited ISG15 deficiency, however, has manifested with two distinct presentations to date: susceptibility to mycobacterial disease and intracranial calcifications from hypomorphic interferon-II (IFN-II) production and excessive IFN-I response, respectively. Accordingly, these patients were managed for their infectious and neurologic complications. Herein, we describe five new patients with six novel ISG15 mutations presenting with skin lesions who were managed for dermatologic disease. Cellularly, we denote striking specificity to the IFN-I response, which was previously assumed to be universal. In peripheral blood, myeloid cells display the most robust IFN-I signatures. In the affected skin, IFN-I signaling is observed in the keratinocytes of the epidermis, endothelia, and the monocytes and macrophages of the dermis. These findings define the specific cells causing circulating and dermatologic inflammation and expand the clinical spectrum of ISG15 deficiency to dermatologic presentations as a third phenotype co-dominant to the infectious and neurologic manifestations."	0

Bacteriophage- or prophage-region-encoded anti-CRISPR (acr) gene molecules provide the potential to control targeting specificity and potency to allow for optimal RNA editing and nucleic acid detection by spatiotemporally modulating endonuclease activities. Using integrated approaches to screen acrVI candidates and evaluate their effects on Cas13 function, we discovered a series of acrVIA1-7 genes that block the activities of Cas13a. These VI-A CRISPR inhibitors substantially attenuate RNA targeting and editing by Cas13a in human cells. Strikingly, type VI-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVIAs) also significantly muffle the single-nucleic-acid editing ability of the dCas13a RNA-editing system. Mechanistically, AcrVIA1, -4, -5, and -6 bind LwaCas13a, while AcrVIA2 and -3 can only bind the LwaCas13-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) complex.

"31130363"	"Cyclin F Controls Cell-Cycle Transcriptional Outputs by Directing the Degradation of the Three Activator E2Fs.E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3A, the three activators of the E2F family of transcription factors, are key regulators of the G1/S transition, promoting transcription of hundreds of genes critical for cell-cycle progression. We found that during late S and in G2, the degradation of all three activator E2Fs is controlled by cyclin F, the substrate receptor of 1 of 69 human SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3A interact with the cyclin box of cyclin F via their conserved N-terminal cyclin binding motifs. In the short term, E2F mutants unable to bind cyclin F remain stable throughout the cell cycle, induce unscheduled transcription in G2 and mitosis, and promote faster entry into the next S phase. However, in the long term, they impair cell fitness. We propose that by restricting E2F activity to the S phase, cyclin F controls one of the main and most critical transcriptional engines of the cell cycle."	1

Poor response rates have been unequivocally shown in mutant KRAS and are even observed in a majority of wild-type KRAS tumors. Therefore, patient selection based on mutational profiling remains problematic. We previously identified methylglyoxal (MGO), a by-product of glycolysis, as a metabolite promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Mutant KRAS cells under MGO stress show AKT-dependent survival when compared with wild-type KRAS isogenic CRC cells. MGO induces AKT activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) and Hsp27 regulation. Importantly, the sole induction of MGO stress in sensitive wild-type KRAS cells renders them resistant to cetuximab. MGO scavengers inhibit AKT and resensitize KRAS-mutated CRC cells to cetuximab in vivo. This study establishes a link between MGO and AKT activation and pinpoints this oncometabolite as a potential target to tackle EGFR-targeted therapy resistance in CRC."	0

However, the transcription factors that regulate differential patterns of gene expression that contribute to specific disease outcomes are not well understood. Here, using gene silencing and overexpression approaches, RNA-Seq, and splicing analysis, we report that the transcription factor B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and drives metastatic disease. Moreover, BCL11A promotes cancer cell invasion by suppressing the expression of muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 (<i>MBNL1</i>), a splicing regulator that suppresses metastasis. This ultimately increases the levels of an alternatively spliced isoform of integrin-α6 (<i>ITGA6</i>), which is associated with worse patient outcomes. These results suggest that BCL11A sustains TNBC cell invasion and metastatic growth by repressing MBNL1-directed splicing of <i>ITGA6</i> Our findings also indicate that BCL11A lies at the interface of transcription and splicing and promotes aggressive TNBC phenotypes."	0

HP1 can bridge chromatin segments and form liquid droplets, but the biophysical principles underlying heterochromatin compartmentalization in the cell nucleus are elusive. Here, we assess mechanistically relevant features of pericentric heterochromatin compaction in mouse fibroblasts. We find that (1) HP1 has only a weak capacity to form liquid droplets in living cells; (2) the size, global accessibility, and compaction of heterochromatin foci are independent of HP1; (3) heterochromatin foci lack a separated liquid HP1 pool; and (4) heterochromatin compaction can toggle between two ""digital"" states depending on the presence of a strong transcriptional activator. These findings indicate that heterochromatin foci resemble collapsed polymer globules that are percolated with the same nucleoplasmic liquid as the surrounding euchromatin, which has implications for our understanding of chromatin compartmentalization and its functional consequences."	0
"32101740"	"Glia Promote Synaptogenesis through an IQGAP PES-7 in C. elegans.Synapses are fundamental to the normal function of the nervous system. Glia play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic formation. However, how presynaptic neurons assemble synaptic structure in response to the glial signals remains largely unexplored. To address this question, we use cima-1 mutant C. elegans as an in vivo model, in which the astrocyte-like VCSC glial processes ectopically reach an asynaptic neurite region and promote presynaptic formation there. Through an RNAi screen, we find that the Rho GTPase CDC-42 and IQGAP PES-7 are required in presynaptic neurons for VCSC glia-induced presynaptic formation. In addition, we find that cdc-42 and pes-7 are also required for normal synaptogenesis during postembryonic developmental stages. PES-7 activated by CDC-42 promotes presynaptic formation, most likely through regulating F-actin assembly. Given the evolutionary conservation of CDC-42 and IQGAPs, we speculate that our findings in C. elegans apply to vertebrates."	0
"31995758"	"Tandem Paired Nicking Promotes Precise Genome Editing with Scarce Interference by p53.Targeted knockin mediated by double-stranded DNA cleavage is accompanied by unwanted insertions and deletions (indels) at on-target and off-target sites.

Here, we demonstrate that tandem paired nicking, a method for targeted knockin involving two Cas9 nickases that create nicks at the homologous regions of the donor DNA and the genome in the same strand, scarcely creates indels at the edited genomic loci, while permitting the efficiency of targeted knockin largely equivalent to that of the Cas9-nuclease-based approach. Tandem paired nicking seems to accomplish targeted knockin by DNA recombination analogous to Holliday's model and creates intended genomic changes without introducing additional nucleotide changes, such as silent mutations. Targeted knockin through tandem paired nicking neither triggers significant p53 activation nor occurs preferentially in p53-suppressed cells. These properties of tandem paired nicking demonstrate its utility in precision genome engineering."	0
"31227231"	"HCF-1 Regulates De Novo Lipogenesis through a Nutrient-Sensitive Complex with ChREBP.Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a key transcriptional regulator of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in response to carbohydrates and in hepatic steatosis. Mechanisms underlying nutrient modulation of ChREBP are under active investigation. Here we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as a previously unknown ChREBP-interacting protein that is enriched in liver biopsies of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Biochemical and genetic studies show that HCF-1 is O-GlcNAcylated in response to glucose as a prerequisite for its binding to ChREBP and subsequent recruitment of OGT, ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation, and activation. The HCF-1:ChREBP complex resides at lipogenic gene promoters, where HCF-1 regulates H3K4 trimethylation to prime recruitment of the Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylase PHF2 for epigenetic activation of these promoters. Overall, these findings define HCF-1's interaction with ChREBP as a previously unappreciated mechanism whereby glucose signals are both relayed to ChREBP and transmitted for epigenetic regulation of lipogenic genes."	1

The data show that chicken embryonic-supporting cells do not derive from the coelomic epithelium, in contrast to other vertebrates studied. Instead, they derive from a DMRT1<sup>+</sup>/PAX2<sup>+</sup>/WNT4<sup>+</sup>/OSR1<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cell population. We find a greater complexity of gonadal cell types than previously thought, including the identification of two distinct sub-populations of Sertoli cells in developing testes and derivation of embryonic steroidogenic cells from a differentiated supporting-cell lineage.

The small ∼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ∼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic."	0

Yet, key steps involved in trafficking of antigens taken up by DCs remain incompletely understood. Here, we screen 700 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and identify 37 enhancers of antigen import from endolysosomes into the cytosol. To reveal their mechanism of action, we generate proteomic organellar maps of control and drug-treated DCs (focusing on two compounds, prazosin and tamoxifen). By combining organellar mapping, quantitative proteomics, and microscopy, we conclude that import enhancers undergo lysosomal trapping leading to membrane permeation and antigen release. Enhancing antigen import facilitates cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated antigens. Systemic administration of prazosin leads to reduced growth of MC38 tumors and to a synergistic effect with checkpoint immunotherapy in a melanoma model. Thus, inefficient antigen import into the cytosol limits antigen cross-presentation, restraining the potency of anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of checkpoint blockers."	0
"30735655"	"Reprogramming of Meiotic Chromatin Architecture during Spermatogenesis.Chromatin organization undergoes drastic reconfiguration during gametogenesis. However, the molecular reprogramming of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process remains poorly understood for mammals, including primates. Here, we examined three-dimensional chromatin architecture during spermatogenesis in rhesus monkey using low-input Hi-C. Interestingly, we found that topologically associating domains (TADs) undergo dissolution and reestablishment in spermatogenesis. Strikingly, pachytene spermatocytes, where synapsis occurs, are strongly depleted for TADs despite their active transcription state but uniquely show highly refined local compartments that alternate between transcribing and non-transcribing regions (refined-A/B). Importantly, such chromatin organization is conserved in mouse, where it remains largely intact upon transcription inhibition. Instead, it is attenuated in mutant spermatocytes, where the synaptonemal complex failed to be established. Intriguingly, this is accompanied by the restoration of TADs, suggesting that the synaptonemal complex may restrict TADs and promote local compartments. Thus, these data revealed extensive reprogramming of higher-order meiotic chromatin architecture during mammalian gametogenesis."	0
"31255466"	"EXD2 Protects Stressed Replication Forks and Is Required for Cell Viability in the Absence of BRCA1/2.Accurate DNA replication is essential to preserve genomic integrity and prevent chromosomal instability-associated diseases including cancer. Key to this process is the cells' ability to stabilize and restart stalled replication forks. Here, we show that the EXD2 nuclease is essential to this process. EXD2 recruitment to stressed forks suppresses their degradation by restraining excessive fork regression. Accordingly, EXD2 deficiency leads to fork collapse, hypersensitivity to replication inhibitors, and genomic instability. Impeding fork regression by inactivation of SMARCAL1 or removal of RECQ1's inhibition in EXD2<sup>-/-</sup> cells restores efficient fork restart and genome stability. Moreover, purified EXD2 efficiently processes substrates mimicking regressed forks. Thus, this work identifies a mechanism underpinned by EXD2's nuclease activity, by which cells balance fork regression with fork restoration to maintain genome stability. Interestingly, from a clinical perspective, we discover that EXD2's depletion is synthetic lethal with mutations in BRCA1/2, implying a non-redundant role in replication fork protection."	0

We develop MethylSight, a program that predicts Kme events solely on the physicochemical properties of residues surrounding the putative methylation sites, which then requires validation by targeted MS. Using this approach, we identify 70 new histone Kme marks with a 90% validation rate. H2BK43me2, which undergoes dynamic changes during stem cell differentiation, is found to be a substrate of KDM5b.

However, how to leverage cellular signaling to ablate TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein for PCa treatment remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage induces proteasomal degradation of wild-type ERG and TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein through ERG threonine-187 and tyrosine-190 phosphorylation mediated by GSK3β and WEE1, respectively. The dual phosphorylation triggers ERG recognition and degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7 in a manner independent of a canonical degron. DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG degradation was abolished by cancer-associated PTEN deletion or GSK3β inactivation. Blockade of DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein degradation causes chemotherapy-resistant growth of fusion-positive PCa cells in culture and in mice. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized TMPRSS2-ERG protein destruction mechanism and demonstrate that intact PTEN and GSK3β signaling are essential for effective targeting of ERG protein by genotoxic therapeutics in fusion-positive PCa."	0
"32518159"	"The yeast exoribonuclease Xrn1 and associated factors modulate RNA polymerase II processivity in 5' and 3' gene regions.mRNA levels are determined by the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay. Protein factors that mediate both processes, including the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1, are responsible for a cross-talk between the two processes that buffers steady-state mRNA levels. However, the roles of these proteins in transcription remain elusive and controversial. Applying native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) to yeast cells, we show that Xrn1 functions mainly as a transcriptional activator and that its disruption manifests as a reduction of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. By combining our sequencing data and mathematical modeling of transcription, we found that Xrn1 modulates transcription initiation and elongation of its target genes. Furthermore, Pol II occupancy markedly increased near cleavage and polyadenylation sites in <i>xrn1</i>Δ cells, whereas its activity decreased, a characteristic feature of backtracked Pol II. We also provide indirect evidence that Xrn1 is involved in transcription termination downstream of polyadenylation sites. We noted that two additional decay factors, Dhh1 and Lsm1, seem to function similarly to Xrn1 in transcription, perhaps as a complex, and that the decay factors Ccr4 and Rpb4 also perturb transcription in other ways. Interestingly, the decay factors could differentiate between SAGA- and TFIID-dominated promoters. These two classes of genes responded differently to <i>XRN1</i> deletion in mRNA synthesis and were differentially regulated by mRNA decay pathways, raising the possibility that one distinction between these two gene classes lies in the mechanisms that balance mRNA synthesis with mRNA decay."	0
"32615089"	"Disome and Trisome Profiling Reveal Genome-wide Targets of Ribosome Quality Control.The ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) system that resolves stalled translation events is activated when ribosomes collide and form disome, trisome, or higher-order complexes. However, it is unclear whether this system distinguishes collision complexes formed on defective mRNAs from those with functional roles on endogenous transcripts. Here, we performed disome and trisome footprint profiling in yeast and found collisions were enriched on diverse sequence motifs known to slow translation. When 60S recycling was inhibited, disomes accumulated at stop codons and could move into the 3' UTR to reinitiate translation. The ubiquitin ligase and RQC factor Hel2/ZNF598 generally recognized collisions but did not induce degradation of endogenous transcripts. However, loss of Hel2 triggered the integrated stress response, via phosphorylation of eIF2α, thus linking these pathways. Our results suggest that Hel2 has a role in sensing ribosome collisions on endogenous mRNAs, and such events may be important for cellular homeostasis."	0
"32023470"	"OTUB1 Is a Key Regulator of RIG-I-Dependent Immune Signaling and Is Targeted for Proteasomal Degradation by Influenza A NS1.Deubiquitylases (DUBs) regulate critical signaling pathways at the intersection of host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Although RIG-I activation is heavily dependent on ubiquitylation, systematic analyses of DUBs that regulate this pathway have not been performed. Using a ubiquitin C-terminal electrophile, we profile DUBs that function during influenza A virus (IAV) infection and isolate OTUB1 as a key regulator of RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Upon infection, OTUB1 relocalizes from the nucleus to mitochondrial membranes together with RIG-I, viral PB2, and NS1. Its expression depends on competing effects of interferon stimulation and IAV-triggered degradation. OTUB1 activates RIG-I via a dual mechanism of K48 polyubiquitin hydrolysis and formation of an E2-repressive complex with UBCH5c. We reconstitute this mechanism in a cell-free system comprising [<sup>35</sup>S]IRF3, purified RIG-I, mitochondrial membranes, and cytosol expressing OTUB1 variants. A range of IAV NS1 proteins trigger proteasomal degradation of OTUB1, antagonizing the RIG-I signaling cascade and antiviral responses."	1

To study roles for <i>MYCN</i> amplification in SCLC progression and chemoresistance, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing SCLC. In treatment-naïve mice, <i>MYCN</i> overexpression promoted cell cycle progression, suppressed infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and accelerated SCLC. <i>MYCN</i> overexpression also suppressed response to cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy, with similar findings made upon <i>MYCL</i> overexpression. We extended these data to genetically perturb chemosensitive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC. In chemosensitive PDX models, overexpression of either <i>MYCN</i> or <i>MYCL</i> also conferred a switch to chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic strategies for <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing SCLC, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA screen. We identified the deubiquitinase USP7 as a <i>MYCN</i>-associated synthetic vulnerability. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 resensitized chemoresistant <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing PDX models to chemotherapy in vivo. Our findings show that <i>MYCN</i> overexpression drives SCLC chemoresistance and provide a therapeutic strategy to restore chemosensitivity."	0

Here we evaluate the capacity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity. We included 36 whole-genome-characterized PDOs from 23 OC patients with known clinical histories. OC PDOs maintain the genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulate patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel combination treatment. PDOs display inter- and intrapatient drug response heterogeneity to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, which can be partially explained by genetic aberrations. PDO drug screening identifies high responsiveness to at least one drug for 88% of patients. PDOs are valuable preclinical models that can provide insights into drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge of genetic and drug response heterogeneity."	0

"30905508"	"Cut-and-Run: A Distinct Mechanism by which V(D)J Recombination Causes Genome Instability.V(D)J recombination is essential to generate antigen receptor diversity but is also a potent cause of genome instability. Many chromosome alterations that result from aberrant V(D)J recombination involve breaks at single recombination signal sequences (RSSs). A long-standing question, however, is how such breaks occur. Here, we show that the genomic DNA that is excised during recombination, the excised signal circle (ESC), forms a complex with the recombinase proteins to efficiently catalyze breaks at single RSSs both in vitro and in vivo. Following cutting, the RSS is released while the ESC-recombinase complex remains intact to potentially trigger breaks at further RSSs. Consistent with this, chromosome breaks at RSSs increase markedly in the presence of the ESC. Notably, these breaks co-localize with those found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and occur at key cancer driver genes. We have named this reaction ""cut-and-run"" and suggest that it could be a significant cause of lymphocyte genome instability."	0

Given these dual functions, several studies have examined whether Wnt ligands provide a tissue-scale orientation cue for PCP establishment during development, and these studies have reached differing conclusions. Here, we re-examine this issue in the Drosophila melanogaster wing and notum using split-Gal4 co-expression analysis, multiplex somatic CRISPR, and double RNAi experiments. Pairwise loss-of-function experiments targeting wg together with other Wnt genes, via somatic CRISPR or RNAi, do not produce PCP defects in the wing or notum. In addition, somatic CRISPR against evi (aka wntless), which is required for the secretion of Wnt ligands, did not produce detectable PCP phenotypes. Altogether, our results do not support the hypothesis that Wnt ligands contribute to PCP signaling in the Drosophila wing or notum."	0
"32001511"	"HELLS and PRDM9 form a pioneer complex to open chromatin at meiotic recombination hot spots.Chromatin barriers prevent spurious interactions between regulatory elements and DNA-binding proteins. One such barrier, whose mechanism for overcoming is poorly understood, is access to recombination hot spots during meiosis. Here we show that the chromatin remodeler HELLS and DNA-binding protein PRDM9 function together to open chromatin at hot spots and provide access for the DNA double-strand break (DSB) machinery. Recombination hot spots are decorated by a unique combination of histone modifications not found at other regulatory elements. HELLS is recruited to hot spots by PRDM9 and is necessary for both histone modifications and DNA accessibility at hot spots. In male mice lacking HELLS, DSBs are retargeted to other sites of open chromatin, leading to germ cell death and sterility. Together, these data provide a model for hot spot activation in which HELLS and PRDM9 form a pioneer complex to create a unique epigenomic environment of open chromatin, permitting correct placement and repair of DSBs."	1

Methods to resolve cell cycle length heterogeneity in real time are currently lacking. Here, we describe a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter that captures live-cell cycle speed using a single measurement. This reporter is based on the color-changing fluorescent timer (FT) protein, which emits blue fluorescence when newly synthesized before maturing into a red fluorescent protein. We generated a mouse strain expressing an H2B-FT fusion reporter from a universally active locus and demonstrate that faster cycling cells can be distinguished from slower cycling ones on the basis of the intracellular fluorescence ratio between the FT's blue and red states. Using this reporter, we reveal the native cell cycle speed distributions of fresh hematopoietic cells and demonstrate its utility in analyzing cell proliferation in solid tissues. This system is broadly applicable for dissecting functional heterogeneity associated with cell cycle dynamics in complex tissues."	0
"31995729"	"Liquidity Is a Critical Determinant for Selective Autophagy of Protein Condensates.Clearance of biomolecular condensates by selective autophagy is thought to play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. However, the mechanism underlying selective autophagy of condensates and whether liquidity determines a condensate's susceptibility to degradation by autophagy remain unknown. Here, we show that the selective autophagic cargo aminopeptidase I (Ape1) undergoes phase separation to form semi-liquid droplets. The Ape1-specific receptor protein Atg19 localizes to the surface of Ape1 droplets both in vitro and in vivo, with the ""floatability"" of Atg19 preventing its penetration into droplets. In vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that Atg19 and lipidated Atg8 are necessary and sufficient for selective sequestration of Ape1 droplets by membranes. This sequestration is impaired by mutational solidification of Ape1 droplets or diminished ability of Atg19 to float. Taken together, we propose that cargo liquidity and the presence of sufficient amounts of autophagic receptor on cargo are crucial for selective autophagy of biomolecular condensates."	0

"32032532"	"Regulation of Cohesin-Mediated Chromosome Folding by Eco1 and Other Partners.Cohesin, a member of the SMC complex family, holds sister chromatids together but also shapes chromosomes by promoting the formation of long-range intra-chromatid loops, a process proposed to be mediated by DNA loop extrusion. Here we describe the roles of three cohesin partners, Pds5, Wpl1, and Eco1, in loop formation along either unreplicated or mitotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. Pds5 limits the size of DNA loops via two different pathways: the canonical Wpl1-mediated releasing activity and an Eco1-dependent mechanism. In the absence of Pds5, the main barrier to DNA loop expansion appears to be the centromere. Our data also show that Eco1 acetyl-transferase inhibits the translocase activity that powers loop formation and contributes to the positioning of loops through a mechanism that is distinguishable from its role in cohesion establishment. This study reveals that the mechanisms regulating cohesin-dependent chromatin loops are conserved among eukaryotes while promoting different functions."	0
"32354834"	"The spatial regulation of condensin activity in chromosome condensation.Condensin mediates chromosome condensation, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Prior to anaphase of budding yeast, the ribosomal DNA (RDN) condenses to a thin loop that is distinct from the rest of the chromosomes. We provide evidence that the establishment and maintenance of this RDN condensation requires the regulation of condensin by Cdc5p (polo) kinase. We show that Cdc5p is recruited to the site of condensin binding in the RDN by cohesin, a complex related to condensin. Cdc5p and cohesin prevent condensin from misfolding the RDN into an irreversibly decondensed state. From these and other observations, we propose that the spatial regulation of Cdc5p by cohesin modulates condensin activity to ensure proper RDN folding into a thin loop. This mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved, promoting the thinly condensed constrictions that occur at centromeres and RDN of mitotic chromosomes in plants and animals."	0
"30712990"	"Ribosomal Proteins Regulate MHC Class I Peptide Generation for Immunosurveillance.The MHC class I antigen presentation system enables T cell immunosurveillance of cancers and viruses. A substantial fraction of the immunopeptidome derives from rapidly degraded nascent polypeptides (DRiPs).

We show that 60S ribosomal proteins L6 (RPL6) and RPL28, which are adjacent on the ribosome, play opposite roles in generating an influenza A virus-encoded peptide. Depleting RPL6 decreases ubiquitin-dependent peptide presentation, whereas depleting RPL28 increases ubiquitin-dependent and -independent peptide presentation. 40S ribosomal protein S28 (RPS28) knockdown increases total peptide supply in uninfected cells by increasing DRiP synthesis from non-canonical translation of ""untranslated"" regions and non-AUG start codons and sensitizes tumor cells for T cell targeting.

"32220645"	"Structural Basis for pri-miRNA Recognition by Drosha.A commencing and critical step in miRNA biogenesis involves processing of pri-miRNAs in the nucleus by Microprocessor. An important, but not completely understood, question is how Drosha, the catalytic subunit of Microprocessor, binds pri-miRNAs and correctly specifies cleavage sites. Here we report the cryoelectron microscopy structures of the Drosha-DGCR8 complex with and without a pri-miRNA. The RNA-bound structure provides direct visualization of the tertiary structure of pri-miRNA and shows that a helix hairpin in the extended PAZ domain and the mobile basic (MB) helix in the RNase IIIa domain of Drosha coordinate to recognize the single-stranded to double-stranded junction of RNA, whereas the dsRNA binding domain makes extensive contacts with the RNA stem. Furthermore, the RNA-free structure reveals an autoinhibitory conformation of the PAZ helix hairpin. These findings provide mechanistic insights into pri-miRNA cleavage site selection and conformational dynamics governing pri-miRNA recognition by the catalytic component of Microprocessor."	0
"32375026"	"Succinate Can Shuttle Reducing Power from the Hypoxic Retina to the O<sub>2</sub>-Rich Pigment Epithelium.When O<sub>2</sub> is plentiful, the mitochondrial electron transport chain uses it as a terminal electron acceptor. However, the mammalian retina thrives in a hypoxic niche in the eye. We find that mitochondria in retinas adapt to their hypoxic environment by reversing the succinate dehydrogenase reaction to use fumarate to accept electrons instead of O<sub>2</sub>. Reverse succinate dehydrogenase activity produces succinate and is enhanced by hypoxia-induced downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. Retinas can export the succinate they produce to the neighboring O<sub>2</sub>-rich retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex. There, succinate enhances O<sub>2</sub> consumption by severalfold. Malate made from succinate in the pigment epithelium can then be imported into the retina, where it is converted to fumarate to again accept electrons in the reverse succinate dehydrogenase reaction. This malate-succinate shuttle can sustain these two tissues by transferring reducing power from an O<sub>2</sub>-poor tissue (retina) to an O<sub>2</sub>-rich one (retinal pigment epithelium-choroid)."	0

Within the past decade, EBOV has caused two large and difficult-to-control outbreaks, one of which recently ended in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bats are the likely reservoir of EBOV, but little is known of their relationship with the virus. We perform serial passages of EBOV in human and bat cells and use circular sequencing to compare the short-term evolution of the virus. Virus populations passaged in bat cells have sequence markers indicative of host RNA editing enzyme activity, including evidence for ADAR editing of the EBOV glycoprotein. Multiple regions in the EBOV genome appear to have undergone adaptive evolution when passaged in bat and human cells. Individual mutated viruses are rescued and characterized. Our results provide insight into the host species-specific evolution of EBOV and highlight the adaptive flexibility of the virus."	0

What happens to delay activity when information stored in working memory is no longer relevant for guiding behavior? In this study, we perform juxtacellular recording and labeling of delay-tuned (-elevated or -suppressed) neurons in the prelimbic cortex of freely moving rats, performing a familiar delayed cue-matching-to-place task. Unexpectedly, novel task-rules are introduced, rendering information held in working memory irrelevant. Following successful strategy switching within one session, delay-tuned neurons are filled with neurobiotin for histological analysis. Delay-elevated neurons include pyramidal cells with large heterogeneity of soma-dendritic distribution, molecular expression profiles, and task-relevant activity. Rule change induces heterogenous adjustments on individual neurons and ensembles' activity but cumulates in balanced firing rate reorganizations across cortical layers. Our results demonstrate divergent cellular and network dynamics when an abrupt change in task rules interferes with working memory."	0

This unusual inhibitory mechanism raises the question of how the drug imposes sequence selectivity onto a general translation factor. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1⋅ATP analog⋅RocA⋅polypurine RNA complex. RocA targets the ""bi-molecular cavity"" formed characteristically by eIF4A1 and a sharply bent pair of consecutive purines in the RNA. Natural amino acid substitutions found in Aglaia eIF4As changed the cavity shape, leading to RocA resistance.

However, the mechanism of this U1 activity, termed telescripting, is unknown. Here, we captured a complex, comprising U1 and CPA factors (U1-CPAFs), that binds intronic PASs and suppresses PCPA. U1-CPAFs are distinct from U1-spliceosomal complexes; they include CPA's three main subunits, CFIm, CPSF, and CstF; lack essential splicing factors; and associate with transcription elongation and mRNA export complexes. Telescripting requires U1:pre-mRNA base-pairing, which can be disrupted by U1 antisense oligonucleotide (U1 AMO), triggering PCPA. U1 AMO remodels U1-CPAFs, revealing changes, including recruitment of CPA-stimulating factors, that explain U1-CPAFs' switch from repressive to activated states. Our findings outline this U1 telescripting mechanism and demonstrate U1's unique role as central regulator of pre-mRNA processing and transcription."	0

Cyclotides have diverse bioactivities, and their cytotoxicity has attracted significant attention for its potential anticancer applications. <i>Hybanthus enneaspermus</i> (Linn) F. Muell is a medicinal herb widely used in India as a libido enhancer, and a previous study has reported that it may contain cyclotides. In the current study, we isolated 11 novel cyclotides and 1 known cyclotide (cycloviolacin O2) from <i>H. enneaspermus</i> and used tandem MS to determine their amino acid sequences. We found that among these cyclotides, hyen C comprises a unique sequence in loops 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 compared with known cyclotides. The most abundant cyclotide in this plant, hyen D, had anticancer activity comparable to that of cycloviolacin O2, one of the most cytotoxic known cyclotides. We also provide mechanistic insights into how these novel cyclotides interact with and permeabilize cell membranes. Results from surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that hyen D, E, L, and M and cycloviolacin O2 preferentially interact with model lipid membranes that contain phospholipids with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine headgroups. The results of a lactate dehydrogenase assay indicated that exposure to these cyclotides compromises cell membrane integrity. Using live-cell imaging, we show that hyen D induces rapid membrane blebbing and cell necrosis. Cyclotide-membrane interactions correlated with the observed cytotoxicity, suggesting that membrane permeabilization and disintegration underpin cyclotide cytotoxicity. These findings broaden our knowledge on the indigenous Indian herb <i>H. enneaspermus</i> and have uncovered cyclotides with potential anticancer activity."	0
"32187533"	"A Model of Differential Mammary Growth Initiation by Stat3 and Asymmetric Integrin-α6 Inheritance.Multiple cancer-related genes both promote and paradoxically suppress growth initiation, depending on the cell context. We discover an explanation for how this occurs for one such protein, Stat3, based on asymmetric cell division. Here, we show that Stat3, by Stathmin/PLK-1, regulates mitotic spindle orientation, and we use it to create and test a model for differential growth initiation. We demonstrate that Integrin-α6 is polarized and required for mammary growth initiation. Spindles orient relative to polar Integrin-α6, dividing perpendicularly in normal cells and parallel in tumor-derived cells, resulting in asymmetric or symmetric Integrin-α6 inheritance, respectively. Stat3 inhibition randomizes spindle orientation, which promotes normal growth initiation while reducing tumor-derived growth initiation. Lipid raft disruption depolarizes Integrin-α6, inducing spindle-orientation-independent Integrin-α6 inheritance. Stat3 inhibition no longer affects the growth of these cells, suggesting Stat3 acts through the regulation of spindle orientation to control growth initiation."	0

We identified the regulator of pre-mRNA-domain-containing (RPRD) proteins as reader proteins of K7ac. K7ac enhanced CTD peptide binding to the CTD-interacting domain (CID) of RPRD1A and RPRD1B proteins in isothermal calorimetry and molecular modeling experiments. Deacetylase inhibitors increased K7ac- and decreased S5-phosphorylated polymerases, consistent with acetylation-dependent S5 dephosphorylation by an RPRD-associated S5 phosphatase. Consistent with this model, RPRD1B knockdown increased S5p but enhanced K7ac, indicating that RPRD proteins recruit K7 deacetylases, including HDAC1.

Here, we uncover a complex interplay between apoptosis, necrosis, and senescence in determining cfDNA release kinetics. Utilizing multiple in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we show how cfDNA release is modulated through a combination of apoptotic and senescent triggers and inhibitors. Interestingly, we identify treatment-induced senescence as a previously unrecognized determinant of cfDNA kinetics that can counteract its release. Necrosis is the predominant cell death mechanism that consistently contributes to cfDNA release in response to ionizing radiation, and, surprisingly, apoptosis plays a comparatively minor role in some tumors. Based on our results, we propose a model to explain cfDNA release from cells over time, with important implications for future studies."	0

Deficiency in BUD13 was associated with increased IR, decreased mature Irf7 transcript and protein levels, and consequently a dampened type I interferon response, which compromised the ability of BUD13-deficient macrophages to withstand vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Global analysis of BUD13 knockdown and BUD13 cross-linking to RNA revealed a subset of introns that share many characteristics with the one found in Irf7 and are spliced in a BUD13-dependent manner. Deficiency of BUD13 led to decreased mature transcript from genes containing such introns. Thus, by acting as an antagonist to IR, BUD13 facilitates the expression of genes at which IR occurs."	0

To discover underlying regulation, we assess transcriptome datasets for dynamic gene networks during heart regeneration and identify suppression of genes associated with the transcription factor Tp53. Cardiac damage leads to fluctuation of Tp53 protein levels, concomitant with induced expression of its central negative regulator, mdm2, in regenerating cardiomyocytes. Zebrafish lacking functional Tp53 display increased indicators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration, whereas transgenic Mdm2 blockade inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Induced myocardial overexpression of the mitogenic factors Nrg1 or Vegfaa in the absence of injury also upregulates mdm2 and suppresses Tp53 levels, and tp53 mutations augment the mitogenic effects of Nrg1. mdm2 induction is spatiotemporally associated with markers of de-differentiation in injury and growth contexts, suggesting a broad role in cardiogenesis.

HA and S proteins are heavily glycosylated, making them potential targets for carbohydrate binding agents such as lectins. Here, we show that the lectin FRIL, isolated from hyacinth beans (Lablab purpureus), has anti-influenza and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. FRIL can neutralize 11 representative human and avian influenza strains at low nanomolar concentrations, and intranasal administration of FRIL is protective against lethal H1N1 infection in mice. FRIL binds preferentially to complex-type N-glycans and neutralizes viruses that possess complex-type N-glycans on their envelopes. As a homotetramer, FRIL is capable of aggregating influenza particles through multivalent binding and trapping influenza virions in cytoplasmic late endosomes, preventing their nuclear entry. Remarkably, FRIL also effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, preventing viral protein production and cytopathic effect in host cells. These findings suggest a potential application of FRIL for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza and COVID-19."	0

The inhibitors labeled the cytoplasmic surface domain of the NqrB subunit including a protruding N-terminal stretch, which may be critical to regulate the UQ reaction in the adjacent NqrA subunit. The labeling was blocked by short-chain UQs such as ubiquinone-2. The photolabile group (2-aryl-5-carboxytetrazole (ACT)) of these inhibitors reacts with nucleophilic amino acids, so we tested mutations of nucleophilic residues in the labeled region of NqrB, such as Asp<sup>49</sup> and Asp<sup>52</sup> (to Ala), and observed moderate decreases in labeling yields, suggesting that these residues are involved in the interaction with ACT. We conclude that the inhibitors interfere with the UQ reaction in two ways: the first is blocking structural rearrangements at the cytoplasmic interface between NqrA and NqrB, and the second is the direct obstruction of UQ binding at this interfacial area. Unusual competitive behavior between the photoreactive inhibitors and various competitors corroborates our previous proposition that there may be two inhibitor binding sites in Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR."	0
"32905776"	"Modulating Isoprenoid Biosynthesis Increases Lipooligosaccharides and Restores Acinetobacter baumannii Resistance to Host and Antibiotic Stress.Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia and a critical threat due to multidrug resistance. The A. baumannii outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer composed of inner leaflet glycerophospholipids and outer leaflet lipooligosaccharides. Deleting mlaF of the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system causes A. baumannii to become more susceptible to pulmonary surfactants and antibiotics and decreases bacterial survival in the lungs of mice. Spontaneous suppressor mutants isolated from infected mice contain an ISAba11 insertion upstream of the ispB initiation codon, an essential isoprenoid biosynthesis gene. The insertion restores antimicrobial resistance and virulence to ΔmlaF. The suppressor strain increases lipooligosaccharides, suggesting that the mechanism involves balancing the glycerophospholipids/lipooligosaccharides ratio on the bacterial surface. An identical insertion exists in an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate, demonstrating its clinical relevance. These data show that the stresses bacteria encounter during infection select for genomic rearrangements that increase resistance to antimicrobials."	0
"32755596"	"The Lon Protease Links Nucleotide Metabolism with Proteotoxic Stress.During proteotoxic stress, bacteria maintain critical processes like DNA replication while removing misfolded proteins, which are degraded by the Lon protease. Here, we show that in Caulobacter crescentus Lon controls deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools during stress through degradation of the transcription factor CcrM. Elevated dNTP/nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) ratios in Δlon cells protects them from deletion of otherwise essential deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP)-producing pathways and shields them from hydroxyurea-induced loss of dNTPs. Increased dNTP production in Δlon results from higher expression of ribonucleotide reductase driven by increased CcrM. We show that misfolded proteins can stabilize CcrM by competing for limited protease and that Lon-dependent control of dNTPs improves fitness during protein misfolding conditions. We propose that linking dNTP production with availability of Lon allows Caulobacter to maintain replication capacity when misfolded protein burden increases, such as during rapid growth. Because Lon recognizes misfolded proteins regardless of the stress, this mechanism allows for response to a variety of unanticipated conditions."	0

"32075760"	"Toll-like Receptor 2 Facilitates Oxidative Damage-Induced Retinal Degeneration.Retinal degeneration is a form of neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause of vision loss globally. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are primary components of the innate immune system involved in signal transduction. Here we show that TLR2 induces complement factors C3 and CFB, the common and rate-limiting factors of the alternative pathway in both retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and mononuclear phagocytes. Neutralization of TLR2 reduces opsonizing fragments of C3 in the outer retina and protects photoreceptor neurons from oxidative stress-induced degeneration. TLR2 deficiency also preserves tight junction expression and promotes RPE resistance to fragmentation. Finally, oxidative stress-induced formation of the terminal complement membrane attack complex and Iba1+ cell infiltration are strikingly inhibited in the TLR2-deficient retina. Our data directly implicate TLR2 as a mediator of retinal degeneration in response to oxidative stress and present TLR2 as a bridge between oxidative damage and complement-mediated retinal pathology."	0
"32433966"	"CNTF-STAT3-IL-6 Axis Mediates Neuroinflammatory Cascade across Schwann Cell-Neuron-Microglia.Neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in many neurological disorders. Injury to the peripheral sensory nerves leads to a neuroinflammatory response in the somatosensory pathway, from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) to the spinal cord, contributing to neuropathic pain. How the immune reaction is initiated peripherally and propagated to the spinal cord remains less clear. Here, we find that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), highly expressed in Schwann cells, mediates neuroinflammatory response through the activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and inducing interleukin 6 (IL-6) in sensory neurons. Cntf deficiency attenuates neuroinflammation in DRG and the spinal cord with alleviated pain post-injury. Recombinant CNTF applied to the sensory nerves recapitulates neuroinflammation in the DRG and spinal cord, with consequent pain development. We delineate the CNTF-STAT3-IL-6 axis in mediating the onset and progression of the inflammatory cascade from the periphery to the spinal cord with therapeutic implications for neuropathic pain."	1
"32320663"	"Knocking Out Non-muscle Myosin II in Retinal Ganglion Cells Promotes Long-Distance Optic Nerve Regeneration.In addition to altered gene expression, pathological cytoskeletal dynamics in the axon are another key intrinsic barrier for axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that knocking out myosin IIA and IIB (myosin IIA/B) in retinal ganglion cells alone, either before or after optic nerve crush, induces significant optic nerve regeneration. Combined Lin28a overexpression and myosin IIA/B knockout lead to an additive promoting effect and long-distance axon regeneration. Immunostaining, RNA sequencing, and western blot analyses reveal that myosin II deletion does not affect known axon regeneration signaling pathways or the expression of regeneration-associated genes. Instead, it abolishes the retraction bulb formation and significantly enhances the axon extension efficiency. The study provides clear evidence that directly targeting neuronal cytoskeleton is sufficient to induce significant CNS axon regeneration and that combining altered gene expression in the soma and modified cytoskeletal dynamics in the axon is a promising approach for long-distance CNS axon regeneration."	0
"32101734"	"Predicting Successful Generation and Inhibition of Seizure-like Afterdischarges and Mapping Their Seizure Networks Using fMRI.To understand the conditions necessary to initiate and terminate seizures, we investigate optogenetically induced hippocampal seizures with LFP, fMRI, and optogenetic inhibition. During afterdischarge induction using optogenetics, LFP recordings show that stimulations with earlier ictal onset times are more likely to result in afterdischarges and are more difficult to curtail with optogenetic inhibition. These results are generalizable across two initiation sites, the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. fMRI shows that afterdischarges initiated from the dorsal or ventral hippocampus exhibit distinct networks. Short-duration seizures initiated in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus are unilateral and bilateral, respectively, while longer-duration afterdischarges recruit broader, bilateral networks. When optogenetic inhibition is ineffective at stopping seizures, the network activity spreads more extensively but largely overlaps with the network activity associated with seizures that could be curtailed. These results provide insights into how seizures can be inhibited, which has implications for targeted seizure interventions."	0
"32299913"	"The SHCA adapter protein cooperates with lipoma-preferred partner in the regulation of adhesion dynamics and invadopodia formation.SHC adaptor protein (SHCA) and lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) mediate transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Reduced expression of either protein diminishes breast cancer lung metastasis, but the reason for this effect is unclear. Here, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that TGFβ enhanced the assembly and disassembly rates of paxillin-containing adhesions in an SHCA-dependent manner through the phosphorylation of the specific SHCA tyrosine residues Tyr-239, Tyr-240, and Tyr-313. Using a BioID proximity labeling approach, we show that SHCA exists in a complex with a variety of actin cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin and LPP. Consistent with a functional interaction between SHCA and LPP, TGFβ-induced LPP localization to cellular adhesions depended on SHCA. Once localized to the adhesions, LPP was required for TGFβ-induced increases in cell migration and adhesion dynamics. Mutations that impaired LPP localization to adhesions (mLIM1) or impeded interactions with the actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin (ΔABD) abrogated migratory responses to TGFβ. Live-cell TIRF microscopy revealed that SHCA clustering at the cell membrane preceded LPP recruitment. We therefore hypothesize that, in the presence of TGFβ, SHCA promotes the formation of small, dynamic adhesions by acting as a nucleator of focal complex formation. Finally, we defined a previously unknown function for SHCA in the formation of invadopodia, a process that also required LPP. Our results reveal that SHCA controls the formation and function of adhesions and invadopodia, two key cellular structures required for breast cancer metastasis."	0
"32049010"	"Secreted Pyruvate Kinase M2 Promotes Lung Cancer Metastasis through Activating the Integrin Beta1/FAK Signaling Pathway.Cancer cell-derived secretomes have been documented to play critical roles in cancer progression. Intriguingly, alternative extracellular roles of intracellular proteins are involved in various steps of tumor progression, which can offer strategies to fight cancer. Herein, we identify lung cancer progression-associated secretome signatures using mass spectrometry analysis. Among them, PKM2 is verified to be highly expressed and secreted in lung cancer cells and clinical samples. Functional analyses demonstrates that secreted PKM2 facilitates tumor metastasis. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis and functional validation identify integrin β1 as a receptor of secreted PKM2. Mechanistically, secreted PKM2 directly bound to integrin β1 and subsequently activated the FAK/SRC/ERK axis to promote tumor metastasis. Collectively, our findings suggest that PKM2 is a potential serum biomarker for diagnosing lung cancer and that targeting the secreted PKM2-integrin β1 axis can inhibit lung cancer development, which provides evidence of a potential therapeutic strategy in lung cancer."	1
"31256989"	"lncRNA-Induced Spread of Polycomb Controlled by Genome Architecture, RNA Abundance, and CpG Island DNA.Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) cause Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) to spread over broad regions of the mammalian genome. We report that in mouse trophoblast stem cells, the Airn and Kcnq1ot1 lncRNAs induce PRC-dependent chromatin modifications over multi-megabase domains. Throughout the Airn-targeted domain, the extent of PRC-dependent modification correlated with intra-nuclear distance to the Airn locus, preexisting genome architecture, and the abundance of Airn itself. Specific CpG islands (CGIs) displayed characteristics indicating that they nucleate the spread of PRCs upon exposure to Airn. Chromatin environments surrounding Xist, Airn, and Kcnq1ot1 suggest common mechanisms of PRC engagement and spreading. Our data indicate that lncRNA potency can be tightly linked to lncRNA abundance and that within lncRNA-targeted domains, PRCs are recruited to CGIs via lncRNA-independent mechanisms. We propose that CGIs that autonomously recruit PRCs interact with lncRNAs and their associated proteins through three-dimensional space to nucleate the spread of PRCs in lncRNA-targeted domains."	0
"31980388"	"A Cancer-Specific Ubiquitin Ligase Drives mRNA Alternative Polyadenylation by Ubiquitinating the mRNA 3' End Processing Complex.Alternative polyadenylation (APA) contributes to transcriptome complexity by generating mRNA isoforms with varying 3' UTR lengths. APA leading to 3' UTR shortening (3' US) is a common feature of most cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanisms are not understood. Here, we describe a widespread mechanism promoting 3' US in cancer through ubiquitination of the mRNA 3' end processing complex protein, PCF11, by the cancer-specific MAGE-A11-HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase. MAGE-A11 is normally expressed only in the male germline but is frequently re-activated in cancers. MAGE-A11 is necessary for cancer cell viability and is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis. Screening for targets of MAGE-A11 revealed that it ubiquitinates PCF11, resulting in loss of CFIm25 from the mRNA 3' end processing complex. This leads to APA of many transcripts affecting core oncogenic and tumor suppressors, including cyclin D2 and PTEN. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms driving APA in cancer and suggest therapeutic strategies."	1
"31398324"	"Reaction Mechanisms of Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 Drive RNA Channeling in the siRNA-Directed DNA Methylation Pathway.In eukaryotes with multiple small RNA pathways, the mechanisms that channel RNAs within specific pathways are unclear. Here, we reveal the reactions that account for channeling in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis phase of the Arabidopsis RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. The process begins with template DNA transcription by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV), whose atypical termination mechanism, induced by nontemplate DNA base-pairing, channels transcripts to the associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2. RDR2 converts Pol IV transcripts into double-stranded RNAs and then typically adds an extra untemplated 3' terminal nucleotide to the second strands. The dicer endonuclease DCL3 cuts resulting duplexes to generate 24- and 23-nt siRNAs. The 23-nt RNAs bear the untemplated terminal nucleotide of the RDR2 strand and are underrepresented among ARGONAUTE4-associated siRNAs. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into Pol IV termination, Pol IV-RDR2 coupling, and RNA channeling, from template DNA transcription to siRNA strand discrimination."	0
"32546483"	"Disrupting phosphatase SHP2 in macrophages protects mice from high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance by elevating IL-18 levels.Chronic low-grade inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) has been reported to play diverse roles in different tissues during the development of metabolic disorders. We previously reported that SHP2 inhibition in macrophages results in increased cytokine production. Here, we investigated the association between SHP2 inhibition in macrophages and the development of metabolic diseases. Unexpectedly, we found that mice with a conditional SHP2 knockout in macrophages (cSHP2-KO) have ameliorated metabolic disorders. cSHP2-KO mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) gained less body weight and exhibited decreased hepatic steatosis, as well as improved glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity, compared with HFD-fed WT littermates. Further experiments revealed that SHP2 deficiency leads to hyperactivation of caspase-1 and subsequent elevation of interleukin 18 (IL-18) levels, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> Of note, IL-18 neutralization and caspase-1 knockout reversed the amelioration of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance observed in the cSHP2-KO mice. Administration of two specific SHP2 inhibitors, SHP099 and Phps1, improved HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Our findings provide detailed insights into the role of macrophagic SHP2 in metabolic disorders. We conclude that pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 may represent a therapeutic strategy for the management of type 2 diabetes."	0
"32492426"	"Functional Divergence of the Arabidopsis Florigen-Interacting bZIP Transcription Factors FD and FDP.Flowering of many plant species depends on interactions between basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and systemically transported florigen proteins. Members of the genus Arabidopsis contain two of these bZIPs, FD and FDP, which we show have largely complementary expression patterns in shoot apices before and during flowering. CRISPR-Cas9-induced null mutants for FDP flower slightly earlier than wild-type, whereas fd mutants are late flowering. Identical G-box sequences are enriched at FD and FDP binding sites, but only FD binds to genes involved in flowering and only fd alters their transcription. However, both proteins bind to genes involved in responses to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), which controls developmental and stress responses. Many of these genes are differentially expressed in both fd and fdp mutant seedlings, which also show reduced ABA sensitivity. Thus, florigen-interacting bZIPs have distinct functions in flowering dependent on their expression patterns and, at earlier stages in development, play common roles in phytohormone signaling."	0

"32234476"	"Cyclopentenone Prostaglandins and Structurally Related Oxidized Lipid Species Instigate and Share Distinct Pro- and Anti-inflammatory Pathways.Oxidized lipids play a critical role in a variety of diseases with two faces: pro- and anti-inflammatory. The molecular mechanisms of this Janus-faced activity remain largely unknown. Here, we have identified that cyclopentenone-containing prostaglandins such as 15d-PGJ2 and structurally related oxidized phospholipid species possess a dual and opposing bioactivity in inflammation, depending on their concentration. Exposure of dendritic cells (DCs)/macrophages to low concentrations of such lipids before Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation instigates an anti-inflammatory response mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation and downstream targets. By contrast, high concentrations of such lipids upon TLR activation of DCs/macrophages result in inflammatory apoptosis characterized by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-8-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β maturation independently of Nrf2 and the classical inflammasome pathway. These results uncover unexpected pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of physiologically relevant lipid species generated by enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation dependent on their concentration, a phenomenon known as hormesis."	0
"32130910"	"Direct Comparison of Mononucleated and Binucleated Cardiomyocytes Reveals Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Distinct Proliferative Competencies.The mammalian heart is incapable of regenerating a sufficient number of cardiomyocytes to ameliorate the loss of contractile muscle after acute myocardial injury. Several reports have demonstrated that mononucleated cardiomyocytes are more responsive than are binucleated cardiomyocytes to pro-proliferative stimuli. We have developed a strategy to isolate and characterize highly enriched populations of mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes at various times of development. Our results suggest that an E2f/Rb transcriptional network is central to the divergence of these two populations and that remnants of the differences acquired during the neonatal period remain in adult cardiomyocytes. Moreover, inducing binucleation by genetically blocking the ability of cardiomyocytes to complete cytokinesis leads to a reduction in E2f target gene expression, directly linking the E2f pathway with nucleation. These data identify key molecular differences between mononucleated and binucleated mammalian cardiomyocytes that can be used to leverage cardiomyocyte proliferation for promoting injury repair in the heart."	0
"32023472"	"Hyperexcitable Neurons Enable Precise and Persistent Information Encoding in the Superficial Retrosplenial Cortex.The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is essential for memory and navigation, but the neural codes underlying these functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the most prominent cell type in layers 2/3 (L2/3) of the mouse granular RSC is a hyperexcitable, small pyramidal cell. These cells have a low rheobase (LR), high input resistance, lack of spike frequency adaptation, and spike widths intermediate to those of neighboring fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons and regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons. LR cells are excitatory but rarely synapse onto neighboring neurons. Instead, L2/3 is a feedforward, not feedback, inhibition-dominated network with dense connectivity between FS cells and from FS to LR neurons. Biophysical models of LR but not RS cells precisely and continuously encode sustained input from afferent postsubicular head-direction cells. Thus, the distinct intrinsic properties of LR neurons can support both the precision and persistence necessary to encode information over multiple timescales in the RSC."	0

However, in most cases, analysis of brain images remains dependent on highly subjective and sample-specific manual processing, preventing precise comparison across sample animals. In the present study, we introduce AMaSiNe, software for automated mapping of single neurons in the standard mouse brain atlas with annotated regions. AMaSiNe automatically calibrates misaligned and deformed slice samples to locate labeled neuronal positions from multiple brain samples into the standardized 3D Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas. We exploit the high fidelity and reliability of AMaSiNe to investigate the topographic structures of feedforward projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus to the primary visual area by reconstructing rabies-virus-injected brain slices in 3D space. Our results demonstrate that distinct organization of neural projections can be precisely mapped using AMaSiNe."	0

"32783927"	"Input-Output Relationship of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Reveals Intact Homeostatic Mechanisms in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.Cellular hyperexcitability is a salient feature of fragile X syndrome animal models. The cellular basis of hyperexcitability and how it responds to changing activity states is not fully understood. Here, we show increased axon initial segment length in CA1 of the Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mouse hippocampus, with increased cellular excitability. This change in length does not result from reduced AIS plasticity, as prolonged depolarization induces changes in AIS length independent of genotype. However, depolarization does reduce cellular excitability, the magnitude of which is greater in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> neurons. Finally, we observe reduced functional inputs from the entorhinal cortex, with no genotypic difference in the firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This suggests that AIS-dependent hyperexcitability in Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup> mice may result from adaptive or homeostatic regulation induced by reduced functional synaptic connectivity. Thus, while AIS length and intrinsic excitability contribute to cellular hyperexcitability, they may reflect a homeostatic mechanism for reduced synaptic input onto CA1 neurons."	0
"32433972"	"Predicting mRNA Abundance Directly from Genomic Sequence Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field."	0

Here, a functional hypothalamic-pituitary unit is generated using human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in vitro. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion capacity of the induced pituitary reached a comparable level to that of adult mouse pituitary because of the simultaneous maturation with hypothalamic neurons within the same aggregates. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamic area regulates ACTH cells similarly to our hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Our induced hypothalamic-pituitary units respond to environmental hypoglycemic condition in vitro, which mimics a life-threatening situation in vivo, through the CRH-ACTH pathway, and succeed in increasing ACTH secretion. Thus, we generated powerful hybrid organoids by recapitulating hypothalamic-pituitary development, showing autonomous maturation on the basis of interactions between developing tissues."	0
"32937127"	"Infection with Bacteroides Phage BV01 Alters the Host Transcriptome and Bile Acid Metabolism in a Common Human Gut Microbe.Gut-associated phages are hypothesized to alter the abundance and activity of their bacterial hosts, contributing to human health and disease. Although temperate phages constitute a significant fraction of the gut virome, the effects of lysogenic infection are underexplored. We report that the temperate phage, Bacteroides phage BV01, broadly alters its host's transcriptome, the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides vulgatus. This alteration occurs through phage-induced repression of a tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) and represses bile acid deconjugation. Because microbially modified bile acids are important signals for the mammalian host, this is a mechanism by which a phage may influence mammalian phenotypes. Furthermore, BV01 and its relatives in the proposed phage family Salyersviridae are ubiquitous in human gut metagenomes, infecting a broad range of Bacteroides hosts. These results demonstrate the complexity of phage-bacteria-mammal relationships and emphasize a need to better understand the role of temperate phages in the gut microbiome."	0
"32105612"	"Lamina-Dependent Stretching and Unconventional Chromosome Compartments in Early C. elegans Embryos.Current models suggest that chromosome domains segregate into either an active (A) or inactive (B) compartment. B-compartment chromatin is physically separated from the A compartment and compacted by the nuclear lamina. To examine these models in the developmental context of C. elegans embryogenesis, we undertook chromosome tracing to map the trajectories of entire autosomes. Early embryonic chromosomes organized into an unconventional barbell-like configuration, with two densely folded B compartments separated by a central A compartment. Upon gastrulation, this conformation matured into conventional A/B compartments. We used unsupervised clustering to uncover subpopulations with differing folding properties and variable positioning of compartment boundaries. These conformations relied on tethering to the lamina to stretch the chromosome; detachment from the lamina compacted, and allowed intermingling between, A/B compartments. These findings reveal the diverse conformations of early embryonic chromosomes and uncover a previously unappreciated role for the lamina in systemic chromosome stretching."	0
"32839549"	"Epigenetic silencing of the ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL7 impairs c-SRC degradation and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis.Epigenetic plasticity is a pivotal factor that drives metastasis. Here, we show that the promoter of the gene that encodes the ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL7 is hypermethylated in advanced prostate and pancreatic cancers, correlating with decreased FBXL7 mRNA and protein levels. Low FBXL7 mRNA levels are predictive of poor survival in patients with pancreatic and prostatic cancers. FBXL7 mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of active c-SRC after its phosphorylation at Ser 104. The DNA-demethylating agent decitabine recovers FBXL7 expression and limits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in a c-SRC-dependent manner. In vivo, FBXL7-depleted cancer cells form tumours with a high metastatic burden. Silencing of c-SRC or treatment with the c-SRC inhibitor dasatinib together with FBXL7 depletion prevents metastases. Furthermore, decitabine reduces metastases derived from prostate and pancreatic cancer cells in a FBXL7-dependent manner. Collectively, this research implicates FBXL7 as a metastasis-suppressor gene and suggests therapeutic strategies to counteract metastatic dissemination of pancreatic and prostatic cancer cells."	1
"30898439"	"Inheritance of a Phenotypically Neutral Epimutation Evokes Gene Silencing in Later Generations.Small RNAs trigger the formation of epialleles that are silenced across generations. Consequently, RNA-directed epimutagenesis is associated with persistent gene repression. Here, we demonstrate that small interfering RNA-induced epimutations in fission yeast are still inherited even when the silenced gene is reactivated, and descendants can reinstate the silencing phenotype that only occurred in their ancestors. This process is mediated by the deposition of a phenotypically neutral molecular mark composed of tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3). Its stable propagation is coupled to RNAi and requires maximal binding affinity of the Clr4/Suvar39 chromodomain to H3K9me3. In wild-type cells, this mark has no visible impact on transcription but causes gene silencing if RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) activity is impaired. In sum, our results reveal a distinct form of epigenetic memory in which cells acquire heritable, transcriptionally active epialleles that confer gene silencing upon modulation of Paf1C."	0

Yet the regulatory mechanisms underlying such integration are often unknown. Here, we establish that the transcription regulators Rtg1/3 are key determinants of sphingolipid homeostasis in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Quantitative analysis of the C. albicans lipidome reveals Rtg1/3-dependent alterations in all complex sphingolipids and their precursors, ceramides. Mutations in the regulators render the fungus susceptible to myriocin, a sphingolipid synthesis inhibitor. Rtg1/3 exert control on the expression of several enzymes involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids' building blocks, and the regulators are activated upon engulfment of C. albicans cells by human neutrophils. We demonstrate that Rtg1p and Rtg3p are regulated at two levels, one in response to sphingolipids and the other by the nutrient sensor TOR. Our findings, therefore, indicate that the Rtg1/3 system integrates nutrient sensing into the synthesis of complex lipids."	0
"32610127"	"The AP1 Transcription Factor Fosl2 Promotes Systemic Autoimmunity and Inflammation by Repressing Treg Development.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a major population in the control of immune homeostasis and autoimmunity.

Mice overexpressing Fosl2 (Fosl2<sup>tg</sup>) indeed show a systemic inflammatory phenotype, with immune infiltrates in multiple organs. This phenotype is absent in Fosl2<sup>tg</sup> × Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice lacking T and B cells, and Fosl2 induces T cell-intrinsic reduction of Treg development that is responsible for the inflammatory phenotype. Fosl2<sup>tg</sup> T cells can transfer inflammation, which is suppressed by the co-delivery of Tregs, while Fosl2 deficiency in T cells reduces the severity of autoimmunity in the EAE model.

"31968248"	"Remodeling of Metastatic Vasculature Reduces Lung Colonization and Sensitizes Overt Metastases to Immunotherapy.Due to limited current therapies, metastases are the primary cause of mortality in cancer patients. Here, we employ a fusion compound of the cytokine LIGHT and a vascular targeting peptide (LIGHT-VTP) that homes to angiogenic blood vessels in primary tumors. We show in primary mouse lung cancer that normalization of tumor vasculature by LIGHT-VTP prevents cancer cell intravasation. Further, LIGHT-VTP efficiently targets pathological blood vessels in the pre-metastatic niche, reducing vascular hyper-permeability and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thus blocking metastatic lung colonization. Moreover, we demonstrate that mouse and human metastatic melanoma deposits are targetable by VTP. In overt melanoma metastases, LIGHT-VTP normalizes intra-metastatic blood vessels and increases GrzB<sup>+</sup> effector T cells. Successful treatment induces high endothelial venules (HEVs) and lymphocyte clusters, which sensitize refractory lung metastases to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.

Here, we utilize live-cell single-molecule tracking to monitor Pol δ holoenzyme interaction with the genome in real time. We find holoenzyme assembly and disassembly in vivo are highly dynamic and ordered. PCNA generally loads onto the genome before Pol δ. Once assembled, the holoenzyme has a relatively short lifetime on the genome, implying multiple Pol δ binding events may be needed to synthesize an Okazaki fragment. During disassembly, Pol δ dissociation generally precedes PCNA unloading. We also find that Pol δ p125, the catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme, is maintained at a constant cellular level, indicating an active mechanism for control of Pol δ levels in vivo.

"32641494"	"Modulation of Kv4.2/KChIP3 interaction by the ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 protein CLN3.Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels of the Kv4 subfamily associate with Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs), which leads to enhanced surface expression and shapes the inactivation gating of these channels. KChIP3 has been reported to also interact with the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3 (ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3), which is modified because of gene mutation in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL). The present study was undertaken to find out whether and how CLN3, by its interaction with KChIP3, may indirectly modulate Kv4.2 channel expression and function. To this end, we expressed KChIP3 and CLN3, either individually or simultaneously, together with Kv4.2 in HEK 293 cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found a lower amount of KChIP3 bound to Kv4.2 in the presence of CLN3. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, we examined the effects of CLN3 co-expression on the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels. Simultaneous co-expression of CLN3 and KChIP3 with Kv4.2 resulted in a suppression of the typical KChIP3-mediated modulation; <i>i.e.</i> we observed less increase in current density, less slowing of macroscopic current decay, less acceleration of recovery from inactivation, and a less positively shifted voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. The suppression of the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels was weaker for the JNCL-related missense mutant CLN3<sub>R334C</sub> and for a JNCL-related C-terminal deletion mutant (CLN3ΔC). Our data support the notion that CLN3 is involved in Kv4.2/KChIP3 somatodendritic A-type channel formation, trafficking, and function, a feature that may be lost in JNCL."	0
"32697997"	"Metabolic Maturation Media Improve Physiological Function of Human iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes.Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have enormous potential for the study of human cardiac disorders. However, their physiological immaturity severely limits their utility as a model system and their adoption for drug discovery. Here, we describe maturation media designed to provide oxidative substrates adapted to the metabolic needs of human iPSC (hiPSC)-CMs. Compared with conventionally cultured hiPSC-CMs, metabolically matured hiPSC-CMs contract with greater force and show an increased reliance on cardiac sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) cycling. The media enhance the function, long-term survival, and sarcomere structures in engineered heart tissues. Use of the maturation media made it possible to reliably model two genetic cardiac diseases: long QT syndrome type 3 due to a mutation in the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel SCN5A and dilated cardiomyopathy due to a mutation in the RNA splicing factor RBM20. The maturation media should increase the fidelity of hiPSC-CMs as disease models."	0

To determine the cellular and molecular basis for aberrant megakaryopoiesis in myelofibrosis, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of 135,929 CD34<sup>+</sup> lineage<sup>-</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), single-cell proteomics, genomics, and functional assays. We identified a bias toward megakaryocyte differentiation apparent from early multipotent stem cells in myelofibrosis and associated aberrant molecular signatures. A sub-fraction of myelofibrosis megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) are transcriptionally similar to healthy-donor MkPs, but the majority are disease specific, with distinct populations expressing fibrosis- and proliferation-associated genes. Mutant-clone HSPCs have increased expression of megakaryocyte-associated genes compared to wild-type HSPCs, and we provide early validation of G6B as a potential immunotherapy target. Our study paves the way for selective targeting of the myelofibrosis clone and illustrates the power of single-cell multi-omics to discover tumor-specific therapeutic targets and mediators of tissue fibrosis."	0
"32572169"	"SPIN90 associates with mDia1 and the Arp2/3 complex to regulate cortical actin organization.Cell shape is controlled by the submembranous cortex, an actomyosin network mainly generated by two actin nucleators: the Arp2/3 complex and the formin mDia1. Changes in relative nucleator activity may alter cortical organization, mechanics and cell shape. Here we investigate how nucleation-promoting factors mediate interactions between nucleators. In vitro, the nucleation-promoting factor SPIN90 promotes formation of unbranched filaments by Arp2/3, a process thought to provide the initial filament for generation of dendritic networks. Paradoxically, in cells, SPIN90 appears to favour a formin-dominated cortex. Our in vitro experiments reveal that this feature stems mainly from two mechanisms: efficient recruitment of mDia1 to SPIN90-Arp2/3 nucleated filaments and formation of a ternary SPIN90-Arp2/3-mDia1 complex that greatly enhances filament nucleation. Both mechanisms yield rapidly elongating filaments with mDia1 at their barbed ends and SPIN90-Arp2/3 at their pointed ends. Thus, in networks, SPIN90 lowers branching densities and increases the proportion of long filaments elongated by mDia1."	0
"32877682"	"Heterogeneity of Antiviral Responses in the Upper Respiratory Tract Mediates Differential Non-lytic Clearance of Influenza Viruses.Influenza viruses initiate infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT), but early viral tropism and the importance of cell-type-specific antiviral responses in this tissue remain incompletely understood. By infecting transgenic lox-stop-lox reporter mice with a Cre-recombinase-expressing influenza B virus, we identify olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as a major viral cell target in the URT. These cells become infected, then eliminate the virus and survive in the host post-resolution of infection. OSN responses to infection are characterized by a strong induction of interferon-stimulated genes and more rapid clearance of viral protein relative to other cells in the epithelium. We speculate that this cell-type-specific response likely serves to protect the central nervous system from infection. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of evaluating antiviral responses across different cell types, even those within the same tissue, to more fully understand the mechanisms of viral disease."	0
"31973889"	"PIKES Analysis Reveals Response to Degraders and Key Regulatory Mechanisms of the CRL4 Network.Co-opting Cullin4 RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s) to inducibly degrade pathogenic proteins is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. Despite intense efforts to rationally design degrader molecules that co-opt CRL4s, much about the organization and regulation of these ligases remains elusive. Here, we establish protein interaction kinetics and estimation of stoichiometries (PIKES) analysis, a systematic proteomic profiling platform that integrates cellular engineering, affinity purification, chemical stabilization, and quantitative mass spectrometry to investigate the dynamics of interchangeable multiprotein complexes. Using PIKES, we show that ligase assemblies of Cullin4 with individual substrate receptors differ in abundance by up to 200-fold and that Cand1/2 act as substrate receptor exchange factors. Furthermore, degrader molecules can induce the assembly of their cognate CRL4, and higher expression of the associated substrate receptor enhances degrader potency. Beyond the CRL4 network, we show how PIKES can reveal systems level biochemistry for cellular protein networks important to drug development."	0
"32668250"	"Macrophage Exosomes Resolve Atherosclerosis by Regulating Hematopoiesis and Inflammation via MicroRNA Cargo.Developing strategies that promote the resolution of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis remains a major therapeutic challenge. Here, we show that exosomes produced by naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM-exo) contain anti-inflammatory microRNA-99a/146b/378a that are further increased in exosomes produced by BMDM polarized with IL-4 (BMDM-IL-4-exo). These exosomal microRNAs suppress inflammation by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α signaling and foster M2 polarization in recipient macrophages. Repeated infusions of BMDM-IL-4-exo into Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a Western diet reduce excessive hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and thereby the number of myeloid cells in the circulation and macrophages in aortic root lesions. This also leads to a reduction in necrotic lesion areas that collectively stabilize atheroma. Thus, BMDM-IL-4-exo may represent a useful therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α via microRNA cargo delivery."	0
"32541879"	"Neural metabolic imbalance induced by MOF dysfunction triggers pericyte activation and breakdown of vasculature.Mutations in chromatin-modifying complexes and metabolic enzymes commonly underlie complex human developmental syndromes affecting multiple organs. A major challenge is to determine how disease-causing genetic lesions cause deregulation of homeostasis in unique cell types. Here we show that neural-specific depletion of three members of the non-specific lethal (NSL) chromatin complex-Mof, Kansl2 or Kansl3-unexpectedly leads to severe vascular defects and brain haemorrhaging. Deregulation of the epigenetic landscape induced by the loss of the NSL complex in neural cells causes widespread metabolic defects, including an accumulation of free long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Free LCFAs induce a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory signalling cascade in neighbouring vascular pericytes that is rescued by TLR4 inhibition. Pericytes display functional changes in response to LCFA-induced activation that result in vascular breakdown. Our work establishes that neurovascular function is determined by the neural metabolic environment."	0
"32130904"	"Microcircuit Rules Governing Impact of Single Interneurons on Purkinje Cell Output In Vivo.The functional impact of single interneurons on neuronal output in vivo and how interneurons are recruited by physiological activity patterns remain poorly understood. In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurons and their targets, Purkinje cells, receive excitatory inputs from granule cells and climbing fibers. Using dual patch-clamp recordings from interneurons and Purkinje cells in vivo, we probe the spatiotemporal interactions between these circuit elements. We show that single interneuron spikes can potently inhibit Purkinje cell output, depending on interneuron location. Climbing fiber input activates many interneurons via glutamate spillover but results in inhibition of those interneurons that inhibit the same Purkinje cell receiving the climbing fiber input, forming a disinhibitory motif. These interneuron circuits are engaged during sensory processing, creating diverse pathway-specific response functions. These findings demonstrate how the powerful effect of single interneurons on Purkinje cell output can be sculpted by various interneuron circuit motifs to diversify cerebellar computations."	0
"32641496"	"TRESK and TREK-2 two-pore-domain potassium channel subunits form functional heterodimers in primary somatosensory neurons.Two-pore-domain potassium channels (K<sub>2P</sub>) are the major determinants of the background potassium conductance. They play a crucial role in setting the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. These channels form homodimers; however, a few examples of heterodimerization have also been reported. The K<sub>2P</sub> channel subunits TRESK and TREK-2 provide the predominant background potassium current in the primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. A recent study has shown that a TRESK mutation causes migraine because it leads to the formation of a dominant negative truncated TRESK fragment. Surprisingly, this fragment can also interact with TREK-2. In this study, we determined the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the TRESK/TREK-2 heterodimer using a covalently linked TRESK/TREK-2 construct to ensure the assembly of the different subunits. The tandem channel has an intermediate single-channel conductance compared with the TRESK and TREK-2 homodimers. Similar conductance values were recorded when TRESK and TREK-2 were coexpressed, demonstrating that the two subunits can spontaneously form functional heterodimers. The TRESK component confers calcineurin-dependent regulation to the heterodimer and gives rise to a pharmacological profile similar to the TRESK homodimer, whereas the presence of the TREK-2 subunit renders the channel sensitive to the selective TREK-2 activator T2A3. In trigeminal primary sensory neurons, we detected single-channel activity with biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to the TRESK/TREK-2 tandem, indicating that WT TRESK and TREK-2 subunits coassemble to form functional heterodimeric channels also in native cells."	0
"31519521"	"SUMO-Chain-Regulated Proteasomal Degradation Timing Exemplified in DNA Replication Initiation.Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO forms chains, but the identity of SUMO-chain-modified factors and the purpose of this modification remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the budding yeast SUMO protease Ulp2, able to disassemble SUMO chains, as a DDK interactor enriched at replication origins that promotes DNA replication initiation. Replication-engaged DDK is SUMOylated on chromatin, becoming a degradation-prone substrate when Ulp2 no longer protects it against SUMO chain assembly. Specifically, SUMO chains channel DDK for SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5/Slx8-mediated and Cdc48 segregase-assisted proteasomal degradation. Importantly, the SUMOylation-defective ddk-KR mutant rescues inefficient replication onset and MCM activation in cells lacking Ulp2, suggesting that SUMO chains time DDK degradation. Using two unbiased proteomic approaches, we further identify subunits of the MCM helicase and other factors as SUMO-chain-modified degradation-prone substrates of Ulp2 and Slx5/Slx8. We thus propose SUMO-chain/Ulp2-protease-regulated proteasomal degradation as a mechanism that times the availability of functionally engaged SUMO-modified protein pools during replication and beyond."	1

"32049007"	"Phenformin Inhibits Hedgehog-Dependent Tumor Growth through a Complex I-Independent Redox/Corepressor Module.The antidiabetic drug phenformin displays potent anticancer activity in different tumors, but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Using Shh medulloblastoma as model, we show here that at clinically relevant concentrations, phenformin elicits a significant therapeutic effect through a redox-dependent but complex I-independent mechanism. Phenformin inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), a component of the glycerophosphate shuttle, and causes elevations of intracellular NADH content. Inhibition of mGPD mimics phenformin action and promotes an association between corepressor CtBP2 and Gli1, thereby inhibiting Hh transcriptional output and tumor growth. Because ablation of CtBP2 abrogates the therapeutic effect of phenformin in mice, these data illustrate a biguanide-mediated redox/corepressor interplay, which may represent a relevant target for tumor therapy."	1
"32755587"	"A Switch in p53 Dynamics Marks Cells That Escape from DSB-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest.Cellular responses to stimuli can evolve over time, resulting in distinct early and late phases in response to a single signal. DNA damage induces a complex response that is largely orchestrated by the transcription factor p53, whose dynamics influence whether a damaged cell will arrest and repair the damage or will initiate cell death. How p53 responses and cellular outcomes evolve in the presence of continuous DNA damage remains unknown. Here, we have found that a subset of cells switches from oscillating to sustained p53 dynamics several days after undergoing damage. The switch results from cell cycle progression in the presence of damaged DNA, which activates the caspase-2-PIDDosome, a complex that stabilizes p53 by inactivating its negative regulator MDM2. This work defines a molecular pathway that is activated if the canonical checkpoints fail to halt mitosis in the presence of damaged DNA."	0
"32402280"	"Actin Assembly around the Shigella-Containing Vacuole Promotes Successful Infection.The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri forces its uptake into non-phagocytic host cells through the translocation of T3SS effectors that subvert the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we report de novo actin polymerization after cellular entry around the bacterium-containing vacuole (BCV) leading to the formation of a dynamic actin cocoon. This cocoon is thicker than any described cellular actin structure and functions as a gatekeeper for the cytosolic access of the pathogen. Host CDC42, TOCA-1, N-WASP, WIP, the Arp2/3 complex, cortactin, coronin, and cofilin are recruited to the actin cocoon. They are subverted by T3SS effectors, such as IpgD, IpgB1, and IcsB. IcsB immobilizes components of the actin polymerization machinery at the BCV dependent on its fatty acyltransferase activity. This represents a unique microbial subversion strategy through localized entrapment of host actin regulators causing massive actin assembly. We propose that the cocoon promotes subsequent invasion steps for successful Shigella infection."	0
"32839551"	"Acetylation-dependent regulation of PD-L1 nuclear translocation dictates the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.Immunotherapies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) have shown impressive clinical outcomes for multiple tumours. However, only a subset of patients achieves durable responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of the immune checkpoint pathways are not completely understood. Here, we report that PD-L1 translocates from the plasma membrane into the nucleus through interactions with components of the endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, regulated by p300-mediated acetylation and HDAC2-dependent deacetylation of PD-L1. Moreover, PD-L1 deficiency leads to compromised expression of multiple immune-response-related genes. Genetically or pharmacologically modulating PD-L1 acetylation blocks its nuclear translocation, reprograms the expression of immune-response-related genes and, as a consequence, enhances the anti-tumour response to PD-1 blockade. Thus, our results reveal an acetylation-dependent regulation of PD-L1 nuclear localization that governs immune-response gene expression, and thereby advocate targeting PD-L1 translocation to enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade."	1
"31278053"	"HAT1 Coordinates Histone Production and Acetylation via H4 Promoter Binding.The energetic costs of duplicating chromatin are large and therefore likely depend on nutrient sensing checkpoints and metabolic inputs. By studying chromatin modifiers regulated by epithelial growth factor, we identified histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) as an induced gene that enhances proliferation through coordinating histone production, acetylation, and glucose metabolism. In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase, we isolated a HAT1-containing complex bound specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1-dependent transcription of H4 genes required an acetate-sensitive promoter element. HAT1 expression was critical for S-phase progression and maintenance of H3 lysine 9 acetylation at proliferation-associated genes, including histone genes. Therefore, these data describe a feedforward circuit whereby HAT1 captures acetyl groups on nascent histones and drives H4 production by chromatin binding to support chromatin replication and acetylation. These findings have important implications for human disease, since high HAT1 levels associate with poor outcomes across multiple cancer types."	0
"31377117"	"The Magnitude of IFN-γ Responses Is Fine-Tuned by DNA Architecture and the Non-coding Transcript of Ifng-as1.Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), critical for host defense and tumor surveillance, requires tight control of its expression. Multiple cis-regulatory elements exist around Ifng along with a non-coding transcript, Ifng-as1 (also termed NeST). Here, we describe two genetic models generated to dissect the molecular functions of this locus and its RNA product. DNA deletion within the Ifng-as1 locus disrupted chromatin organization of the extended Ifng locus, impaired Ifng response, and compromised host defense. Insertion of a polyA signal ablated the Ifng-as1 full-length transcript and impaired host defense, while allowing proper chromatin structure. Transient knockdown of Ifng-as1 also reduced IFN-γ production. In humans, discordant expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 was evident in memory T cells, with high expression of this long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and low expression of the cytokine. These results establish Ifng-as1 as an important regulator of Ifng expression, as a DNA element and transcribed RNA, involved in dynamic and cell state-specific responses to infection."	0

"32115406"	"Critical roles of phosphoinositides and NF2 in Hippo pathway regulation.The Hippo pathway is a master regulator of tissue homeostasis and organ size. NF2 is a well-established tumor suppressor, and loss of NF2 severely compromises Hippo pathway activity. However, the precise mechanism of how NF2 mediates upstream signals to regulate the Hippo pathway is not clear. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, NF2's lipid-binding ability is critical for its function in activating the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress. Mechanistically, osmotic stress induces PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plasma membrane enrichment by activating the PIP5K family, allowing for NF2 plasma membrane recruitment and subsequent downstream Hippo pathway activation. An NF2 mutant deficient in lipid binding is unable to activate the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress, as measured by LATS and YAP phosphorylation. Our findings identify the PIP5K family as novel regulators upstream of Hippo signaling, and uncover the importance of phosphoinositide dynamics, specifically PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, in Hippo pathway regulation."	1
"32464092"	"Sequence-Independent Self-Assembly of Germ Granule mRNAs into Homotypic Clusters.mRNAs enriched in membraneless condensates provide functional compartmentalization within cells. The mechanisms that recruit transcripts to condensates are under intense study; however, how mRNAs organize once they reach a granule remains poorly understood. Here, we report on a self-sorting mechanism by which multiple mRNAs derived from the same gene assemble into discrete homotypic clusters. We demonstrate that in vivo mRNA localization to granules and self-assembly within granules are governed by different mRNA features: localization is encoded by specific RNA regions, whereas self-assembly involves the entire mRNA, does not involve sequence-specific, ordered intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions, and is thus RNA sequence independent. We propose that the ability of mRNAs to self-sort into homotypic assemblies is an inherent property of an messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) that is augmented under conditions that increase RNA concentration, such as upon enrichment in RNA-protein granules, a process that appears conserved in diverse cellular contexts and organisms."	0

Here, we identify a new modification at the CTD, the deimination of arginine and its conversion to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), an enzyme that has been associated with several diseases, including cancer. We show that, among PADI family members, only PADI2 citrullinates R1810 (Cit1810) at repeat 31 of the CTD. Depletion of PADI2 or loss of R1810 results in accumulation of RNAP2 at transcription start sites, reduced gene expression, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Cit1810 is needed for interaction with the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) kinase complex and for its recruitment to chromatin.

"32294448"	"Thermodynamic and Evolutionary Coupling between the Native and Amyloid State of Globular Proteins.The amyloid-like aggregation propensity present in most globular proteins is generally considered to be a secondary side effect resulting from the requirements of protein stability. Here, we demonstrate, however, that mutations in the globular and amyloid state are thermodynamically correlated rather than simply associated. In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations. We speculate that, rather than being a corollary of protein evolution, it is equally plausible that positive selection for amyloid structure could have been a driver for the emergence of globular protein structure."	0

"32381628"	"Transcriptional down-regulation of metabolic genes by Gdown1 ablation induces quiescent cell re-entry into the cell cycle.Liver regeneration and metabolism are highly interconnected. Here, we show that hepatocyte-specific ablation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated Gdown1 leads to down-regulation of highly expressed genes involved in plasma protein synthesis and metabolism, a concomitant cell cycle re-entry associated with induction of cell cycle-related genes (including <i>cyclin D1</i>), and up-regulation of <i>p21</i> through activation of p53 signaling. In the absence of p53, Gdown1-deficient hepatocytes show a severe dysregulation of cell cycle progression, with incomplete mitoses, and a premalignant-like transformation. Mechanistically, Gdown1 is associated with elongating Pol II on the highly expressed genes and its ablation leads to reduced Pol II recruitment to these genes, suggesting that Pol II redistribution may facilitate hepatocyte re-entry into the cell cycle. These results establish an important physiological function for a Pol II regulatory factor (Gdown1) in the maintenance of normal liver cell transcription through constraints on cell cycle re-entry of quiescent hepatocytes."	0

Here, we show that TLK loss results in severe chromatin decompaction and altered genome accessibility, particularly affecting heterochromatic regions. Failure to maintain heterochromatin increases spurious transcription of repetitive elements and induces features of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). TLK depletion culminates in a cGAS-STING-TBK1-mediated innate immune response that is independent of replication-stress signaling and attenuated by the depletion of factors required to produce extra-telomeric DNA. Analysis of human cancers reveals that chromosomal instability correlates with high TLK2 and low STING levels in many cohorts.

We developed nanopore analysis of co-transcriptional processing (nano-COP), in which nascent RNAs are directly sequenced through nanopores, exposing the dynamics and patterns of RNA splicing without biases introduced by amplification. Long nano-COP reads reveal that, in human and Drosophila cells, splicing occurs after RNA polymerase II transcribes several kilobases of pre-mRNA, suggesting that metazoan splicing transpires distally from the transcription machinery. Inhibition of the branch-site recognition complex SF3B rapidly diminished global co-transcriptional splicing. We found that splicing order does not strictly follow the order of transcription and is associated with cis-acting elements, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding factors. Further, neighboring introns in human cells tend to be spliced concurrently, implying that splicing of these introns occurs cooperatively. Thus, nano-COP unveils the organizational complexity of RNA processing."	0
"32268093"	"TLR9 Sensing of Self-DNA Controls Cell-Mediated Immunity to Listeria Infection via Rapid Conversion of Conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells to T<sub>reg</sub>.CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes are crucial for controlling a range of innate and adaptive immune effectors. For CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can function as helpers (T<sub>H</sub>) to amplify magnitude and functionality or as regulatory cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) capable of profound inhibition. It is unclear what determines differentiation to these phenotypes and whether pathogens provoke alternate programs. We find that, depending on the size of initial dose, Listeria infection drives CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to act as T<sub>H</sub> or induces rapid polyclonal conversion to immunosuppressive T<sub>reg</sub>. Conversion to T<sub>reg</sub> depends on the TLR9 and IL-12 pathways elicited by CD8α<sup>+</sup> dendritic cell (DC) sensing of danger-associated neutrophil self-DNA. These findings resolve long-standing questions regarding the conditional requirement for T<sub>H</sub> amongst pathogens and reveal a remarkable degree of plasticity in the function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can be quickly converted to T<sub>reg</sub>in vivo by infection-mediated immune modulation."	0
"31300275"	"Structures of the Rhodopsin-Transducin Complex: Insights into G-Protein Activation.Rhodopsin (Rho), a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in vertebrate vision, activates the G-protein transducin (G<sub>T</sub>) by catalyzing GDP-GTP exchange on its α subunit (Gα<sub>T</sub>). To elucidate the determinants of G<sub>T</sub> coupling and activation, we obtained cryo-EM structures of a fully functional, light-activated Rho-G<sub>T</sub> complex in the presence and absence of a G-protein-stabilizing nanobody. The structures illustrate how G<sub>T</sub> overcomes its low basal activity by engaging activated Rho in a conformation distinct from other GPCR-G-protein complexes. Moreover, the nanobody-free structures reveal native conformations of G-protein components and capture three distinct conformers showing the Gα<sub>T</sub> helical domain (αHD) contacting the Gβγ subunits. These findings uncover the molecular underpinnings of G-protein activation by visual rhodopsin and shed new light on the role played by Gβγ during receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange."	0
"32231307"	"Single-cell chromatin accessibility maps reveal regulatory programs driving early mouse organogenesis.During mouse embryonic development, pluripotent cells rapidly divide and diversify, yet the regulatory programs that define the cell repertoire for each organ remain ill-defined. To delineate comprehensive chromatin landscapes during early organogenesis, we mapped chromatin accessibility in 19,453 single nuclei from mouse embryos at 8.25 days post-fertilization. Identification of cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin pinpointed two TAL1-bound endothelial enhancers, which we validated using transgenic mouse assays. Integrated gene expression and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses highlighted cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Subsequent in vivo experiments in zebrafish revealed a role for the ETS factor FEV in endothelial identity downstream of ETV2 (Etsrp in zebrafish). Concerted in vivo validation experiments in mouse and zebrafish thus illustrate how single-cell open chromatin maps, representative of a mammalian embryo, provide access to the regulatory blueprint for mammalian organogenesis."	0
"32375041"	"Extracellular Acidosis and mTOR Inhibition Drive the Differentiation of Human Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells.During inflammation, recruited monocytes can differentiate either into macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs); however, little is known about the environmental factors that determine this cell fate decision. Low extracellular pH is a hallmark of a variety of inflammatory processes and solid tumors. Here, we report that low pH dramatically promotes the differentiation of monocytes into DCs (monocyte-derived DCs [mo-DCs]). This process is associated with a reduction in glucose consumption and lactate production, the upregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes, and the inhibition of mTORC1 activity. Interestingly, we also find that both serum starvation and pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 markedly promote the differentiation of mo-DCs. Our study contributes to better understanding the mechanisms that govern the differentiation of monocytes into DCs and reveals the role of both extracellular pH and mTORC1 as master regulators of monocyte cell fate."	0
"32433971"	"G-Protein-Coupled Receptor SRBC-48 Protects against Dendrite Degeneration and Reduced Longevity Due to Infection.Increasing evidence suggests that deficient immune modulation and microbial infections underline neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we show that the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) SRBC-48, which belongs to the class BC serpentine receptors, has a protective role in Caenorhabditis elegans dendrite degeneration caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Our results indicate that SRBC-48 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in AWC neurons to protect against infection-associated dendrite degeneration. The absence of SRBC-48 results in a reduced lifespan caused by a pathogen infection early in life that induces dendrite degeneration. The decreased longevity in animals deficient in SRBC-48 is due to uncontrolled activation of immune genes, particularly those regulated by the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16 that is part of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor homolog DAF-2. These results reveal how an infection early in life can not only induce dendrite degeneration but also reduce lifespan."	0

"32130896"	"An Integrated Metagenome Catalog Reveals New Insights into the Murine Gut Microbiome.The complexity of host-associated microbial ecosystems requires host-specific reference catalogs to survey the functions and diversity of these communities. We generate a comprehensive resource, the integrated mouse gut metagenome catalog (iMGMC), comprising 4.6 million unique genes and 660 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), many (485 MAGs, 73%) of which are linked to reconstructed full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. iMGMC enables unprecedented coverage and taxonomic resolution of the mouse gut microbiota; i.e., more than 92% of MAGs lack species-level representatives in public repositories (<95% ANI match). The integration of MAGs and 16S rRNA gene data allows more accurate prediction of functional profiles of communities than predictions based on 16S rRNA amplicons alone. Accompanying iMGMC, we provide a set of MAGs representing 1,296 gut bacteria obtained through complementary assembly strategies. We envision that integrated resources such as iMGMC, together with MAG collections, will enhance the resolution of numerous existing and future sequencing-based studies."	0
"30772175"	"PINK1 Inhibits Local Protein Synthesis to Limit Transmission of Deleterious Mitochondrial DNA Mutations.We have previously proposed that selective inheritance, the limited transmission of damaging mtDNA mutations from mother to offspring, is based on replication competition in Drosophila melanogaster. This model, which stems from our observation that wild-type mitochondria propagate much more vigorously in the fly ovary than mitochondria carrying fitness-impairing mutations, implies that germ cells recognize the fitness of individual mitochondria and selectively boost the propagation of healthy ones. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase PINK1 preferentially accumulates on mitochondria enriched for a deleterious mtDNA mutation. PINK1 phosphorylates Larp to inhibit protein synthesis on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Impaired local translation on defective mitochondria in turn limits the replication of their mtDNA and hence the transmission of deleterious mutations to the offspring. Our work confirms that selective inheritance occurs at the organelle level during Drosophila oogenesis and provides molecular entry points to test this model in other systems."	0
"30797686"	"Continued Activity of the Pioneer Factor Zelda Is Required to Drive Zygotic Genome Activation.Reprogramming cell fate during the first stages of embryogenesis requires that transcriptional activators gain access to the genome and remodel the zygotic transcriptome. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether the continued activity of these pioneering factors is required throughout zygotic genome activation or whether they are only required early to establish cis-regulatory regions. To address this question, we developed an optogenetic strategy to rapidly and reversibly inactivate the master regulator of genome activation in Drosophila, Zelda. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that continued Zelda activity is required throughout genome activation. We show that Zelda binds DNA in the context of nucleosomes and suggest that this allows Zelda to occupy the genome despite the rapid division cycles in the early embryo. These data identify a powerful strategy to inactivate transcription factor function during development and suggest that reprogramming in the embryo may require specific, continuous pioneering functions to activate the genome."	0
"32246903"	"Differential Scaling of Gene Expression with Cell Size May Explain Size Control in Budding Yeast.Yeast cells must grow to a critical size before committing to division. It is unknown how size is measured. We find that as cells grow, mRNAs for some cell-cycle activators scale faster than size, increasing in concentration, while mRNAs for some inhibitors scale slower than size, decreasing in concentration. Size-scaled gene expression could cause an increasing ratio of activators to inhibitors with size, triggering cell-cycle entry. Consistent with this, expression of the CLN2 activator from the promoter of the WHI5 inhibitor, or vice versa, interfered with cell size homeostasis, yielding a broader distribution of cell sizes. We suggest that size homeostasis comes from differential scaling of gene expression with size. Differential regulation of gene expression as a function of cell size could affect many cellular processes."	0
"32375042"	"The Parkinson's Disease Protein LRRK2 Interacts with the GARP Complex to Promote Retrograde Transport to the trans-Golgi Network.Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the precise function of LRRK2 remains unclear. We report an interaction between LRRK2 and VPS52, a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that identifies a function of LRRK2 in regulating membrane fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, LRRK2 further interacts with the Golgi SNAREs VAMP4 and Syntaxin-6 and acts as a scaffolding platform that stabilizes the GARP-SNAREs complex formation. Therefore, LRRK2 influences both retrograde and post-Golgi trafficking pathways in a manner dependent on its GTP binding and kinase activity. This action is exaggerated by mutations associated with Parkinson's disease and can be blocked by kinase inhibitors. Disruption of GARP sensitizes dopamine neurons to mutant LRRK2 toxicity in C. elegans, showing that these pathways are interlinked in vivo and suggesting a link in PD."	1
"32521269"	"The Protein Arginine Methyltransferase PRMT8 and Substrate G3BP1 Control Rac1-PAK1 Signaling and Actin Cytoskeleton for Dendritic Spine Maturation.Excitatory synapses of neurons are located on dendritic spines. Spine maturation is essential for the stability of synapses and memory consolidation, and overproduction of the immature filopodia is associated with brain disorders. The structure and function of synapses can be modulated by protein post-translational modification (PTM). Arginine methylation is a major PTM that regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and splicing within the nucleus. Here we find that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 is present at neuronal synapses and its expression is upregulated in the hippocampus when dendritic spine maturation occurs. Depletion of PRMT8 leads to overabundance of filopodia and mis-localization of excitatory synapses. Mechanistically, PRMT8 promotes dendritic spine morphology through methylation of the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1 and suppression of the Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway to control synaptic actin dynamics. Our findings unravel arginine methylation as a crucial regulatory mechanism for actin cytoskeleton during synapse development."	1
"32730741"	"Structures of the Cmr-β Complex Reveal the Regulation of the Immunity Mechanism of Type III-B CRISPR-Cas.Cmr-β is a type III-B CRISPR-Cas complex that, upon target RNA recognition, unleashes a multifaceted immune response against invading genetic elements, including single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage, cyclic oligoadenylate synthesis, and also a unique UA-specific single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) hydrolysis by the Cmr2 subunit. Here, we present the structure-function relationship of Cmr-β, unveiling how binding of the target RNA regulates the Cmr2 activities. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed the unique subunit architecture of Cmr-β and captured the complex in different conformational stages of the immune response, including the non-cognate and cognate target-RNA-bound complexes. The binding of the target RNA induces a conformational change of Cmr2, which together with the complementation between the 5' tag in the CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) and the 3' antitag of the target RNA activate different configurations in a unique loop of the Cmr3 subunit, which acts as an allosteric sensor signaling the self- versus non-self-recognition. These findings highlight the diverse defense strategies of type III complexes."	0
"32601372"	"Unrestrained ESCRT-III drives micronuclear catastrophe and chromosome fragmentation.The ESCRT-III membrane fission machinery maintains the integrity of the nuclear envelope. Although primary nuclei resealing takes minutes, micronuclear envelope ruptures seem to be irreversible. Instead, micronuclear ruptures result in catastrophic membrane collapse and are associated with chromosome fragmentation and chromothripsis, complex chromosome rearrangements thought to be a major driving force in cancer development. Here we use a combination of live microscopy and electron tomography, as well as computer simulations, to uncover the mechanism underlying micronuclear collapse. We show that, due to their small size, micronuclei inherently lack the capacity of primary nuclei to restrict the accumulation of CHMP7-LEMD2, a compartmentalization sensor that detects loss of nuclear integrity. This causes unrestrained ESCRT-III accumulation, which drives extensive membrane deformation, DNA damage and chromosome fragmentation. Thus, the nuclear-integrity surveillance machinery is a double-edged sword, as its sensitivity ensures rapid repair at primary nuclei while causing unrestrained activity at ruptured micronuclei, with catastrophic consequences for genome stability."	0
"32101753"	"Auto-ubiquitination of NEDD4-1 Recruits USP13 to Facilitate Autophagy through Deubiquitinating VPS34.The class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) is a core protein of autophagy initiation, yet the regulatory mechanisms responsible for its stringent control remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1 promotes the autophagy flux by targeting VPS34. NEDD4-1 undergoes lysine 29 (K29)-linked auto-ubiquitination at K1279 and serves as a scaffold for recruiting the ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) to form an NEDD4-1-USP13 deubiquitination complex, which subsequently stabilizes VPS34 to promote autophagy through removing the K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from VPS34 at K419. Knockout of either NEDD4-1 or USP13 increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of VPS34, thus attenuating the formation of the autophagosome. Our results identify an essential role for NEDD4-1 in regulating autophagy, which provides molecular insights into the mechanisms by which ubiquitination regulates autophagy flux."	1
"32719551"	"Biophysical properties of AKAP95 protein condensates regulate splicing and tumorigenesis.It remains unknown if biophysical or material properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cancer. Here we show that AKAP95, a nuclear protein that regulates transcription and RNA splicing, plays an important role in tumorigenesis by supporting cancer cell growth and suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. AKAP95 forms phase-separated and liquid-like condensates in vitro and in nucleus. Mutations of key residues to different amino acids perturb AKAP95 condensation in opposite directions. Importantly, the activity of AKAP95 in splice regulation is abolished by disruption of condensation, significantly impaired by hardening of condensates, and regained by substituting its condensation-mediating region with other condensation-mediating regions from irrelevant proteins. Moreover, the abilities of AKAP95 in regulating gene expression and supporting tumorigenesis require AKAP95 to form condensates with proper liquidity and dynamicity. These results link phase separation to tumorigenesis and uncover an important role of appropriate biophysical properties of protein condensates in gene regulation and cancer."	0
"31522988"	"RNA Interactions Are Essential for CTCF-Mediated Genome Organization.The function of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the organization of the genome has become an important area of investigation, but the mechanisms by which CTCF dynamically contributes to genome organization are not clear. We previously discovered that CTCF binds to large numbers of endogenous RNAs, promoting its self-association. In this regard, we now report two independent features that disrupt CTCF association with chromatin: inhibition of transcription and disruption of CTCF-RNA interactions through mutations of 2 of its 11 zinc fingers that are not required for CTCF binding to its cognate DNA site: zinc finger 1 (ZF1) or zinc finger 10 (ZF10). These mutations alter gene expression profiles as CTCF mutants lose their ability to form chromatin loops and thus the ability to insulate chromatin domains and to mediate CTCF long-range genomic interactions. Our results point to the importance of CTCF-mediated RNA interactions as a structural component of genome organization."	0
"30554942"	"Repression of Transcription at DNA Breaks Requires Cohesin throughout Interphase and Prevents Genome Instability.Cohesin subunits are frequently mutated in cancer, but how they function as tumor suppressors is unknown. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion, but this is not always perturbed in cancer cells. Here, we identify a previously unknown role for cohesin. We find that cohesin is required to repress transcription at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Notably, cohesin represses transcription at DSBs throughout interphase, indicating that this is distinct from its known role in mediating DNA repair through sister chromatid cohesion. We identified a cancer-associated SA2 mutation that supports sister chromatid cohesion but is unable to repress transcription at DSBs. We further show that failure to repress transcription at DSBs leads to large-scale genome rearrangements. Cancer samples lacking SA2 display mutational patterns consistent with loss of this pathway. These findings uncover a new function for cohesin that provides insights into its frequent loss in cancer."	0

With the global population set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, and the compounding effects of climate change, the planet is facing challenges that necessitate significant and rapid changes in agricultural practices. In the effort to provide food in terms of calories, the essential contribution of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to nutrition is often overlooked. Here, we focus on the importance of thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) in plant health and discuss its impact on human health. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is an essential dietary component, and deficiencies in this micronutrient underlie several diseases, notably nervous system disorders. The predominant source of dietary vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is plant-based foods. Moreover, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also vital for plants themselves, and its benefits in plant health have received less attention than in the human health sphere. In general, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is well-characterized for its role as a coenzyme in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in energy production and central metabolism, including carbon assimilation and respiration. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also emerging as an important component of plant stress responses, and several noncoenzyme roles of this vitamin are being characterized. We summarize the importance of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> in plants from the perspective of food security, including its roles in plant disease resistance, stress tolerance, and crop yield, and review the potential benefits of biofortification of crops with increased vitamin B<sub>1</sub> content to improve human health."	0
"32561640"	"The guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV3 participates in ERBB4-mediated cancer cell migration.ERBB4 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that regulates cellular processes including proliferation, migration, and survival. ERBB4 signaling is involved in embryogenesis and homeostasis of healthy adult tissues, but also in human pathologies such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Here, an MS-based analysis revealed the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (VAV3), an activator of Rho family GTPases, as a critical ERBB4-interacting protein in breast cancer cells. We confirmed the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction by targeted MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments and further defined it by demonstrating that kinase activity and Tyr-1022 and Tyr-1162 of ERBB4, as well as the intact phosphotyrosine-interacting SH2 domain of VAV3, are necessary for this interaction. We found that ERBB4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the VAV3 activation domain, known to be required for guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of VAV proteins. In addition to VAV3, the other members of the VAV family, VAV1 and VAV2, also coprecipitated with ERBB4. Analyses of the effects of overexpression of dominant-negative VAV3 constructs or shRNA-mediated down-regulation of VAV3 expression in breast cancer cells indicated that active VAV3 is involved in ERBB4-stimulated cell migration. These results define the VAV GEFs as effectors of ERBB4 activity in a signaling pathway relevant for cancer cell migration."	1

Here, we combine induced neurons (iNeurons) derived from embryonic stem cells with quantitative proteomics to reveal the dynamics and specificity of Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation under endogenous expression conditions. Targets showing elevated ubiquitylation in USP30<sup>-/-</sup> iNeurons are concentrated in components of the mitochondrial translocon, and the ubiquitylation kinetics of the vast majority of Parkin targets are unaffected, correlating with a modest kinetic acceleration in accumulation of pS65-Ub and mitophagic flux upon mitochondrial depolarization without USP30. Basally, ubiquitylated translocon import substrates accumulate, suggesting a quality control function for USP30. p97 was dispensable for Parkin ligase activity in iNeurons.

Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and other imprinted loci, in addition to impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and loss of developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we use to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis.

"32610121"	"Adipocyte-Derived Versican and Macrophage-Derived Biglycan Control Adipose Tissue Inflammation in Obesity.Obesity is characterized by adipose tissue inflammation. Because proteoglycans regulate inflammation, here we investigate their role in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. We find that adipose tissue versican and biglycan increase in obesity. Versican is produced mainly by adipocytes and biglycan by adipose tissue macrophages. Both proteoglycans are also present in adipose tissue from obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Deletion of adipocyte-specific versican or macrophage-specific biglycan in mice reduces macrophage accumulation and chemokine and cytokine expression, although only adipocyte-specific versican deletion leads to sustained improvement in glucose tolerance. Macrophage-derived biglycan activates inflammatory genes in adipocytes. Versican expression increases in cultured adipocytes exposed to excess glucose, and adipocyte-conditioned medium stimulates inflammation in resident peritoneal macrophages, in part because of a versican breakdown product, versikine. These findings provide insights into the role of adipocyte- and macrophage-derived proteoglycans in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity."	0
"32521253"	"TRPM5 Negatively Regulates Calcium-Dependent Responses in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated B Lymphocytes.B cells produce high amounts of cytokines and immunoglobulins in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.

Calcium signaling is also implicated in B cell activation; however, its involvement in the cytokine production of LPS-stimulated B cells remains less well characterized. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential melastatin 5 channel (TRPM5), which is one of the CAMs, negatively modulates calcium signaling, thereby regulating LPS-induced proliferative and inflammatory responses by B cells. LPS-stimulated B cells of Trpm5-deficient mice exhibit an increased cytosolic calcium concentration, leading to enhanced proliferation and the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and CXCL10.

"32820036"	"Functional loss of a noncanonical BCOR-PRC1.1 complex accelerates SHH-driven medulloblastoma formation.Medulloblastoma is a malignant childhood brain tumor arising from the developing cerebellum. In Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastoma, aberrant activation of SHH signaling causes increased proliferation of granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), and predisposes these cells to tumorigenesis. A second, cooperating genetic hit is often required to push these hyperplastic cells to malignancy and confer mutation-specific characteristics associated with oncogenic signaling. Somatic loss-of-function mutations of the transcriptional corepressor <i>BCOR</i> are recurrent and enriched in SHH medulloblastoma.

We examine the in vivo effects of GNE-0723, a positive allosteric modulator of GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDARs, on brain network and cognitive functions in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). GNE-0723 use dependently potentiates synaptic NMDA receptor currents and reduces brain oscillation power with a predominant effect on low-frequency (12-20 Hz) oscillations. Interestingly, DS and AD mouse models display aberrant low-frequency oscillatory power that is tightly correlated with network hypersynchrony. GNE-0723 treatment reduces aberrant low-frequency oscillations and epileptiform discharges and improves cognitive functions in DS and AD mouse models. GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDAR enhancers may have therapeutic benefits in brain disorders with network hypersynchrony and cognitive impairments."	0

"31806351"	"HMCES Functions in the Alternative End-Joining Pathway of the DNA DSB Repair during Class Switch Recombination in B Cells.HMCES (5hmC binding, embryonic stem cell-specific-protein), originally identified as a protein capable of binding 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an epigenetic modification generated by TET proteins, was previously reported to covalently crosslink to DNA at abasic sites via a conserved cysteine. We show here that Hmces-deficient mice display normal hematopoiesis without global alterations in 5hmC. HMCES specifically enables DNA double-strand break repair through the microhomology-mediated alternative-end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway during class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells, and HMCES deficiency leads to a significant defect in CSR. HMCES mediates Alt-EJ through its SOS-response-associated-peptidase domain (SRAPd), a function that requires DNA binding but is independent of its autopeptidase and DNA-crosslinking activities. We show that HMCES is recruited to switch regions of the immunoglobulin locus and provide a potential structural basis for the interaction of HMCES with long DNA overhangs generated by Alt-EJ during CSR. Our studies provide further evidence for a specialized role for HMCES in DNA repair."	0
"32540970"	"The GTPase-activating protein p120RasGAP has an evolutionarily conserved ""FLVR-unique"" SH2 domain.The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain has a highly conserved architecture that recognizes linear phosphotyrosine motifs and is present in a wide range of signaling pathways across different evolutionary taxa. A hallmark of SH2 domains is the arginine residue in the conserved FLVR motif that forms a direct salt bridge with bound phosphotyrosine. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP (<i>RASA1</i>) in its apo and peptide-bound form. We find that the arginine residue in the FLVR motif does not directly contact pTyr<sup>1087</sup> of a bound phosphopeptide derived from p190RhoGAP; rather, it makes an intramolecular salt bridge to an aspartic acid. Unexpectedly, coordination of phosphotyrosine is achieved by a modified binding pocket that appears early in evolution. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we find that substitution of the FLVR arginine R377A does not cause a significant loss of phosphopeptide binding, but rather a tandem substitution of R398A (SH2 position βD4) and K400A (SH2 position βD6) is required to disrupt the binding. These results indicate a hitherto unrecognized diversity in SH2 domain interactions with phosphotyrosine and classify the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP as ""FLVR-unique."""	0
"32493770"	"Cross-utilization of β-galactosides and cellobiose in <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i>.Strains of the Gram-positive, thermophilic bacterium <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i> possess elaborate systems for the utilization of hemicellulolytic polysaccharides, including xylan, arabinan, and galactan. These systems have been studied extensively in strains T-1 and T-6, representing microbial models for the utilization of soil polysaccharides, and many of their components have been characterized both biochemically and structurally. Here, we characterized routes by which <i>G. stearothermophilus</i> utilizes mono- and disaccharides such as galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and galactosyl-glycerol. The <i>G. stearothermophilus</i> genome encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) for cellobiose. We found that the cellobiose-PTS system is induced by cellobiose and characterized the corresponding GH1 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, Cel1A. The bacterium also possesses two transport systems for galactose, a galactose-PTS system and an ABC galactose transporter. The ABC galactose transport system is regulated by a three-component sensing system. We observed that both systems, the sensor and the transporter, utilize galactose-binding proteins that also bind glucose with the same affinity. We hypothesize that this allows the cell to control the flux of galactose into the cell in the presence of glucose. Unexpectedly, we discovered that <i>G. stearothermophilus</i> T-1 can also utilize lactose and galactosyl-glycerol via the cellobiose-PTS system together with a bifunctional 6-phospho-β-gal/glucosidase, Gan1D. Growth curves of strain T-1 growing in the presence of cellobiose, with either lactose or galactosyl-glycerol, revealed initially logarithmic growth on cellobiose and then linear growth supported by the additional sugars. We conclude that Gan1D allows the cell to utilize residual galactose-containing disaccharides, taking advantage of the promiscuity of the cellobiose-PTS system."	0
"31837995"	"Polycomb Group Proteins Regulate Chromatin Architecture in Mouse Oocytes and Early Embryos.In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reorganization during oocyte development. However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs. These data reveal a critical role of Polycomb in regulating chromatin architecture during mammalian oocyte growth and early development."	0

Here, we uncover a molecular relationship between p53, an abundant embryonic TF, and WDR5, an essential member of the MLL chromatin modifying complex, that regulates mouse embryonic stem cell fate. Wild-type Wdr5 or transient Wdr5 knockout promotes a distinct pattern of global chromatin accessibility and spurs neuroectodermal differentiation through an RbBP5-dependent process in which WDR5 binds to, and activates transcription of, neural genes. Wdr5 rescue after its prolonged inhibition targets WDR5 to mesoderm lineage-specifying genes, stimulating differentiation toward mesoderm fates in a p53-dependent fashion. Finally, we identify a direct interaction between WDR5 and p53 that enables their co-recruitment to, and regulation of, genes known to control cell proliferation and fate. Our results unmask p53-dependent mechanisms that temporally integrate epigenetic WDR5 inputs to drive neuroectoderm and mesoderm differentiation from pluripotent cells."	0
"31914389"	"STCH4/REIL2 Confers Cold Stress Tolerance in Arabidopsis by Promoting rRNA Processing and CBF Protein Translation.Plants respond to cold stress by inducing the expression of transcription factors that regulate downstream genes to confer tolerance to freezing. We screened an Arabidopsis transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion library and identified a cold-hypersensitive mutant, which we named stch4 (sensitive to chilling 4). STCH4/REIL2 encodes a ribosomal biogenesis factor that is upregulated upon cold stress. Overexpression of STCH4 confers chilling and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. The stch4 mutation reduces CBF protein levels and thus delayed the induction of C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) regulon genes. Ribosomal RNA processing is reduced in stch4 mutants, especially under cold stress. STCH4 associates with multiple ribosomal proteins, and these interactions are modulated by cold stress. These results suggest that the ribosome is a regulatory node for cold stress responses and that STCH4 promotes an altered ribosomal composition and functions in low temperatures to facilitate the translation of proteins important for plant growth and survival under cold stress."	1
"30827740"	"Xist Deletional Analysis Reveals an Interdependency between Xist RNA and Polycomb Complexes for Spreading along the Inactive X.During X-inactivation, Xist RNA spreads along an entire chromosome to establish silencing. However, the mechanism and functional RNA elements involved in spreading remain undefined. By performing a comprehensive endogenous Xist deletion screen, we identify Repeat B as crucial for spreading Xist and maintaining Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/PRC2) along the inactive X (Xi). Unexpectedly, spreading of these three factors is inextricably linked. Deleting Repeat B or its direct binding partner, HNRNPK, compromises recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2. In turn, ablating PRC1 or PRC2 impairs Xist spreading. Therefore, Xist and Polycomb complexes require each other to propagate along the Xi, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between RNA initiator and protein effectors. Perturbing Xist/Polycomb spreading causes failure of de novo Xi silencing, with partial compensatory downregulation of the active X, and also disrupts topological Xi reconfiguration. Thus, Repeat B is a multifunctional element that integrates interdependent Xist/Polycomb spreading, silencing, and changes in chromosome architecture."	0

It is important to identify additional therapeutic targets in ccRCC downstream of VHL loss besides hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α). By performing a genome-wide screen, we identified Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 1 (SFMBT1) as a candidate pVHL target. SFMBT1 was considered to be a transcriptional repressor but its role in cancer remains unclear. ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations displayed elevated SFMBT1 protein levels. SFMBT1 hydroxylation on Proline residue 651 by EglN1 mediated its ubiquitination and degradation governed by pVHL. Depletion of SFMBT1 abolished ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Integrated analyses of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and patient prognosis identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a key SFMBT1 target gene contributing to its oncogenic phenotype. Therefore, the pVHL-SFMBT1-SPHK1 axis serves as a potential therapeutic avenue for ccRCC."	1

We now present a technique based on genome-wide ligation of 3'-OH ends followed by sequencing (GLOE-Seq) and an associated computational pipeline designed for capturing SSBs but versatile enough to be applied to any lesion convertible into a free 3'-OH terminus. We demonstrate its applicability to mapping of Okazaki fragments without prior size selection and provide insight into the relative contributions of DNA ligase 1 and ligase 3 to Okazaki fragment maturation in human cells.

Cell-cell interactions within the niche are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the niche cells supporting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show heterogeneity among Gli1+ MSCs and identify a subpopulation of Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult mouse incisor. These Runx2+/Gli1+ cells are strategically located between MSCs and transit-amplifying cells (TACs). They are not stem cells but help to maintain the MSC niche via IGF signaling to regulate TAC proliferation, differentiation, and incisor growth rate. ATAC-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation reveal that Runx2 directly binds to Igfbp3 in niche cells. This Runx2-mediated IGF signaling is crucial for regulating the MSC niche and maintaining tissue homeostasis to support continuous growth of the adult mouse incisor, providing a model for analysis of the molecular regulation of the MSC niche."	0
"32690606"	"Tectorigenin enhances PDX1 expression and protects pancreatic β-cells by activating ERK and reducing ER stress.Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) is an important transcription factor that regulates islet β-cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Reduced expression of PDX1 is thought to contribute to β-cell loss and dysfunction in diabetes. Thus, promoting PDX1 expression can be an effective strategy to preserve β-cell mass and function. Previously, we established a <i>PDX1</i> promoter-dependent luciferase system to screen agents that can promote PDX1 expression. Natural compound tectorigenin (TG) was identified as a promising candidate that could enhance the activity of the promoter for the <i>PDX1</i> gene. In this study, we first demonstrated that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in β-cells via activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of ERK; this effect was observed under either normal or glucotoxic/lipotoxic conditions. We then found that TG could suppress induced apoptosis and improved the viability of β-cells under glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by activation of ERK and reduction of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects held true <i>in vivo</i> as well: prophylactic or therapeutic use of TG could obviously inhibit ER stress and decrease islet β-cell apoptosis in the pancreas of mice given a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD), thus dramatically maintaining or restoring β-cell mass and islet size, respectively. Accordingly, both prophylactic and therapeutic use of TG improved HFHSD-impaired glucose metabolism in mice, as evidenced by ameliorating hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Taken together, TG, as an agent promoting PDX1 expression exhibits strong protective effects on islet β-cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."	1
"31375263"	"The N-Degron Pathway Mediates ER-phagy.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is susceptible to wear-and-tear and proteotoxic stress, necessitating its turnover. Here, we show that the N-degron pathway mediates ER-phagy. This autophagic degradation initiates when the transmembrane E3 ligase TRIM13 (also known as RFP2) is ubiquitinated via the lysine 63 (K63) linkage. K63-ubiquitinated TRIM13 recruits p62 (also known as sequestosome-1), whose complex undergoes oligomerization. The oligomerization is induced when the ZZ domain of p62 is bound by the N-terminal arginine (Nt-Arg) of arginylated substrates. Upon activation by the Nt-Arg, oligomerized TRIM13-p62 complexes are separated along with the ER compartments and targeted to autophagosomes, leading to lysosomal degradation. When protein aggregates accumulate within the ER lumen, degradation-resistant autophagic cargoes are co-segregated by ER membranes for lysosomal degradation. We developed synthetic ligands to the p62 ZZ domain that enhance ER-phagy for ER protein quality control and alleviate ER stresses. Our results elucidate the biochemical mechanisms and pharmaceutical means that regulate ER homeostasis."	0
"32753669"	"Endosomal membrane tension regulates ESCRT-III-dependent intra-lumenal vesicle formation.The plasma membrane tension strongly affects cell surface processes, such as migration, endocytosis and signalling. However, it is not known whether the membrane tension of organelles regulates their functions, notably intracellular traffic. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III complex is the major membrane remodelling complex that drives intra-lumenal-vesicle (ILV) formation on endosomal membranes. Here we used a fluorescent membrane-tension probe to show that ESCRT-III subunits are recruited onto endosomal membranes when the membrane tension is reduced. We find that tension-dependent recruitment is associated with ESCRT-III polymerization and membrane deformation in vitro and correlates with increased ILV formation in ESCRT-III-decorated endosomes in vivo. Finally, we find that the endosomal membrane tension decreases when ILV formation is triggered by EGF under physiological conditions. These results indicate that membrane tension is a major regulator of ILV formation and endosome trafficking, leading us to conclude that membrane tension can control organelle functions."	0
"32697984"	"RSK2 Maintains Adult Estrogen Homeostasis by Inhibiting ERK1/2-Mediated Degradation of Estrogen Receptor Alpha.In response to estrogens, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a critical regulator of homeostasis, is degraded through the 26S proteasome. However, despite the continued presence of estrogen before menopause, ERα protein levels are maintained. We discovered that ERK1/2-RSK2 activity oscillates during the estrous cycle. In response to high estrogen levels, ERK1/2 is activated and phosphorylates ERα to drive ERα degradation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Reduction of estrogen levels results in ERK1/2 deactivation. RSK2 maintains redox homeostasis, which prevents sustained ERK1/2 activation. In juveniles, ERK1/2-RSK2 activity is not required. Mammary gland regeneration demonstrates that ERK1/2-RSK2 regulation of ERα is intrinsic to the epithelium. Reduced RSK2 and enrichment in an estrogen-regulated gene signature occur in individuals taking oral contraceptives. RSK2 loss enhances DNA damage, which may account for the elevated breast cancer risk with the use of exogenous estrogens. These findings implicate RSK2 as a critical component for the preservation of estrogen homeostasis."	1
"32814039"	"Daily Cycles of Reversible Protein Condensation in Cyanobacteria.An emerging principle of cell biology is the regulated conversion of macromolecules between soluble and condensed states. To screen for such regulation of the cyanobacterial proteome, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins that change solubility during the day-night cycle. We find a set of night-insoluble proteins that includes many enzymes in essential metabolic pathways. Using time-lapse microscopy and isotope labeling, we show that these proteins reversibly transition between punctate structures at night and a soluble state during the day without substantial degradation. We find that the cyanobacterial circadian clock regulates the kinetics of puncta formation during the night and that the appearance of puncta indicates the metabolic status of the cell. Reversible condensation of specific enzymes is thus a regulated response to the day-night cycle and may reflect a general bacterial strategy used in fluctuating growth conditions."	0
"32075772"	"Cooperation of the ATM and Fanconi Anemia/BRCA Pathways in Double-Strand Break End Resection.Cells deficient in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and other anti-cancer agents that induce double-strand DNA breaks. ATM inhibitors may therefore sensitize cancer cells to these agents. Some cancers may also have underlying genetic defects predisposing them to an ATM inhibitor monotherapy response. We have conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genetic vulnerabilities that sensitize lung cancer cells to ATM inhibitors. Knockout of genes in the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway results in hypersensitivity to the ATM inhibitor M3541. Knockdown of either an FA gene or of ATM results in reduced double-strand break end resection, enhanced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, and decreased homologous recombination repair. Knockout of both the FA/BRCA pathway and ATM strongly inhibits end resection and generates toxic levels of NHEJ, thereby elucidating a mechanism of cellular death by synthetic lethality. ATM inhibitors may therefore be useful for the treatment of tumors with a defective FA/BRCA pathway."	0

Genetic studies in mice show that osteocytes are an important source of RANKL, but the cellular sources of OPG are unclear. We use conditional deletion of Tnfrsf11b, which encodes OPG, from different cell populations to identify functionally relevant sources of OPG in mice. Deletion from B lymphocytes and osteocytes, two cell types commonly thought to supply OPG, has little or no impact on bone mass. By contrast, deletion of Tnfrsf11b from osteoblasts increases bone resorption and reduces bone mass to an extent similar to germline deletion, demonstrating that osteoblasts are an essential source of OPG. These results suggest that, in addition to producing new bone matrix, osteoblasts also play an active role in terminating the resorption phase of the bone remodeling cycle by suppressing RANKL activity."	0

Here, we demonstrate representative sequencing (Rep-Seq) as a new method to achieve unbiased tumor tissue sampling. Rep-Seq uses fixed residual tumor material, which is homogenized and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Analysis of intratumor tumor mutation burden (TMB) variability shows a high level of misclassification using current single-biopsy methods, with 20% of lung and 52% of bladder tumors having at least one biopsy with high TMB but low clonal TMB overall. Misclassification rates by contrast are reduced to 2% (lung) and 4% (bladder) when a more representative sampling methodology is used. Rep-Seq offers an improved sampling protocol for tumor profiling, with significant potential for improved clinical utility and more accurate deconvolution of clonal structure."	0

The 3' UTR does not regulate BIRC3 protein localization or abundance but is required for CXCR4-mediated B cell migration. We established an experimental pipeline to study the mechanism of regulation and used mass spectrometry to identify BIRC3 protein interactors. In addition to 3'-UTR-independent interactors involved in known BIRC3 functions, we detected interactors that bind only to BIRC3 protein encoded from the mRNA with the long 3' UTR. They regulate several functions, including CXCR4 trafficking. We further identified RNA-binding proteins differentially bound to the alternative 3' UTRs and found that cooperative binding of Staufen and HuR mediates 3'-UTR-dependent complex formation.

The five populations analyzed were embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) endothelium and hemogenic endothelium from the major arteries, an enriched population of prehematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), fetal liver HSCs, and adult bone marrow HSCs. Using epigenetic signatures, we identified enhancers for each developmental stage. Only 12% of enhancers are primed, and 78% are active, suggesting the vast majority of enhancers are established de novo without prior priming in earlier stages. We constructed developmental stage-specific transcriptional regulatory networks by linking enhancers and predicted bound transcription factors to their target promoters using a novel computational algorithm, target inference via physical connection (TIPC). TIPC predicted known transcriptional regulators for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, validating our overall approach, and identified putative novel transcription factors, including the broadly expressed transcription factors SP3 and MAZ.

We recently identified a role for one specific tRF-5' tRF-Gly-GCC, or tRF-GG-as a repressor of genes associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, but the mechanistic basis for this regulation was unknown. Here, we show that tRF-GG plays a role in production of a wide variety of noncoding RNAs-snoRNAs, scaRNAs, and snRNAs-that are dependent on Cajal bodies for stability and activity. Among these noncoding RNAs, regulation of the U7 snRNA by tRF-GG modulates heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional repression of MERVL elements by supporting an adequate supply of histone proteins. Importantly, the effects of inhibiting tRF-GG on histone mRNA levels, on activity of a histone 3' UTR reporter, and ultimately on MERVL regulation could all be suppressed by manipulating U7 RNA levels. We additionally show that the related RNA-binding proteins hnRNPF and hnRNPH bind directly to tRF-GG, and are required for Cajal body biogenesis, positioning these proteins as strong candidates for effectors of tRF-GG function in vivo. Together, our data reveal a conserved mechanism for 5' tRNA fragment control of noncoding RNA biogenesis and, consequently, global chromatin organization."	0

Although distal 1p36 losses associate with single-copy MYCN tumors, larger deletions correlate with MYCN amplification, indicating two tumor suppressor regions in 1p36, only one of which facilitates MYCN oncogenesis. To better define this region, we genome-edited the syntenic 1p36 locus in primary mouse neural crest cells (NCCs), a putative NBL cell of origin. In in vitro cell transformation assays, we show that Chd5 loss confers most of the MYCN-independent tumor suppressor effects of 1p36 LOH. In contrast, MYCN-driven tumorigenesis selects for NCCs with Arid1a deletions from a pool of NCCs with randomly sized 1p36 deletions, establishing Arid1a as the MYCN-associated tumor suppressor.

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected.

Here, we report the architecture and functional attributes of erenumab critical for its potent antagonism against CGRPR. The crystal structure of erenumab in complex with CGRPR reveals a direct ligand-blocking mechanism, enabled by a remarkable 21-residue-long complementary determining region (CDR)-H3 loop, which adopts a tyrosine-rich helix-turn tip and projects into the deep interface of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and RAMP1 subunits of CGRPR. Furthermore, erenumab engages with residues specific to CLR and RAMP1, providing the molecular basis for its exquisite selectivity. Such structural insights reveal the drug action mechanism of erenumab and shed light on developing antibody therapeutics targeting GPCRs."	0
"32698004"	"Intraflagellar Transport Complex B Proteins Regulate the Hippo Effector Yap1 during Cardiogenesis.Cilia and the intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins involved in ciliogenesis are associated with congenital heart diseases (CHDs). However, the molecular links between cilia, IFT proteins, and cardiogenesis are yet to be established. Using a combination of biochemistry, genetics, and live-imaging methods, we show that IFT complex B proteins (Ift88, Ift54, and Ift20) modulate the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in zebrafish and mouse. We demonstrate that this interaction is key to restrict the formation of the proepicardium and the myocardium. In cellulo experiments suggest that IFT88 and IFT20 interact with YAP1 in the cytoplasm and functionally modulate its activity, identifying a molecular link between cilia-related proteins and the Hippo pathway. Taken together, our results highlight a noncanonical role for IFT complex B proteins during cardiogenesis and shed light on a mechanism of action for ciliary proteins in YAP1 regulation."	0
"31968258"	"Ex Vivo Expanded 3D Human Kidney Spheres Engraft Long Term and Repair Chronic Renal Injury in Mice.End-stage renal disease is a worldwide epidemic requiring renal replacement therapy. Harvesting tissue from failing kidneys and autotransplantation of tissue progenitors could theoretically delay the need for dialysis. Here we use healthy and end-stage human adult kidneys to robustly expand proliferative kidney epithelial cells and establish 3D kidney epithelial cultures termed ""nephrospheres."" Formation of nephrospheres reestablishes renal identity and function in primary cultures. Transplantation into NOD/SCID mice shows that nephrospheres restore self-organogenetic properties lost in monolayer cultures, allowing long-term engraftment as tubular structures, potentially adding nephron segments and demonstrating self-organization as critical to survival. Furthermore, long-term tubular engraftment of nephrospheres is functionally beneficial in murine models of chronic kidney disease. Remarkably, nephrospheres inhibit pro-fibrotic collagen production in cultured fibroblasts via paracrine modulation, while transplanted nephrospheres induce transcriptional signatures of proliferation and release from quiescence, suggesting re-activation of endogenous repair. These data support the use of human nephrospheres for renal cell therapy."	0
"32719553"	"Cell stretching is amplified by active actin remodelling to deform and recruit proteins in mechanosensitive structures.Detection and conversion of mechanical forces into biochemical signals controls cell functions during physiological and pathological processes. Mechanosensing is based on protein deformations and reorganizations, yet the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Using a cell-stretching device compatible with super-resolution microscopy and single-protein tracking, we explored the nanoscale deformations and reorganizations of individual proteins inside mechanosensitive structures. We achieved super-resolution microscopy after live stretching on intermediate filaments, microtubules and integrin adhesions. Simultaneous single-protein tracking and stretching showed that while integrins followed the elastic deformation of the substrate, actin filaments and talin also displayed lagged and transient inelastic responses associated with active acto-myosin remodelling and talin deformations. Capturing acute reorganizations of single molecules during stretching showed that force-dependent vinculin recruitment is delayed and depends on the maturation of integrin adhesions. Thus, cells respond to external forces by amplifying transiently and locally cytoskeleton displacements, enabling protein deformation and recruitment in mechanosensitive structures."	0

However, these methods are technically challenging and not easily applicable to an in vivo setting. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele. We demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of this method in mouse embryonic stem cells, developing embryos, adult tissues, and autochthonous mouse models of human brain and lung cancers. This method and the datasets we have generated will facilitate the characterization of miRNA-mRNA networks in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions."	0

Here, we characterize human SMC complexes condensin I and II and unveil the architecture of the human condensin II complex, revealing two putative DNA-entrapment sites. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that both condensin I and II exhibit ATP-dependent motor activity and promote extensive and reversible compaction of double-stranded DNA. Nucleosomes are incorporated into DNA loops during compaction without being displaced from the DNA, indicating that condensin complexes can readily act upon nucleosome-bound DNA molecules. These observations shed light on critical processes involved in genome organization in human cells."	0
"32699109"	"Auxin-transporting ABC transporters are defined by a conserved D/E-P motif regulated by a prolylisomerase.The plant hormone auxin must be transported throughout plants in a cell-to-cell manner to affect its various physiological functions. ABCB transporters are critical for this polar auxin distribution, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling their function is not fully understood. The auxin transport activity of ABCB1 was suggested to be regulated by a physical interaction with FKBP42/Twisted Dwarf1 (TWD1), a peptidylprolyl <i>cis-trans</i> isomerase (PPIase), but all attempts to demonstrate such a PPIase activity by TWD1 have failed so far. By using a structure-based approach, we identified several surface-exposed proline residues in the nucleotide binding domain and linker of Arabidopsis ABCB1, mutations of which do not alter ABCB1 protein stability or location but do affect its transport activity. P1008 is part of a conserved signature D/E-P motif that seems to be specific for <u>a</u>uxin-<u>t</u>ransporting <u>A</u>BCBs, which we now refer to as ATAs. Mutation of the acidic residue also abolishes auxin transport activity by ABCB1. All higher plant ABCBs for which auxin transport has been conclusively proven carry this conserved motif, underlining its predictive potential. Introduction of this D/E-P motif into malate importer, ABCB14, increases both its malate and its background auxin transport activity, suggesting that this motif has an impact on transport capacity. The D/E-P1008 motif is also important for ABCB1-TWD1 interactions and activation of ABCB1-mediated auxin transport by TWD1. In summary, our data imply a new function for TWD1 acting as a putative activator of ABCB-mediated auxin transport by <i>cis-trans</i> isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds."	0

To examine the functional substitutability of Otx2 and Crx, we generate knockin mouse lines in which Crx is replaced by Otx2 and vice versa. We find that Otx2 and Crx cannot be substituted in photoreceptor development. Subsequently, we investigate the function of Otx2 in photoreceptor and bipolar cell development. High Otx2 levels induce photoreceptor cell fate but not bipolar cell fate, whereas reduced Otx2 expression impairs bipolar cell maturation and survival. Furthermore, we identify Otx2 and Crx in the lamprey genome by using synteny analysis, suggesting that the last common ancestor of vertebrates possesses both Otx2 and Crx. We find that the retinal Otx2 expression pattern is different between lampreys and mice, suggesting that neofunctionalization of Otx2 occurred in the jawed vertebrate lineage."	0

Here, we screen a library of 44,000 non-proprietary compounds for their ability to modulate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Two of them, named MCU-i4 and MCU-i11, are confirmed to reliably decrease mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Docking simulations reveal that these molecules directly bind a specific cleft in MICU1, a key element of the MCU complex that controls channel gating. Accordingly, in MICU1-silenced or deleted cells, the inhibitory effect of the two compounds is lost. Moreover, MCU-i4 and MCU-i11 fail to inhibit mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in cells expressing a MICU1 mutated in the critical amino acids that forge the predicted binding cleft. Finally, these compounds are tested ex vivo, revealing a primary role for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in muscle growth.

"30639241"	"Efficient Pre-mRNA Cleavage Prevents Replication-Stress-Associated Genome Instability.Cellular mechanisms that safeguard genome integrity are often subverted in cancer. To identify cancer-related genome caretakers, we employed a convergent multi-screening strategy coupled to quantitative image-based cytometry and ranked candidate genes according to multivariate readouts reflecting viability, proliferative capacity, replisome integrity, and DNA damage signaling. This unveiled regulators of replication stress resilience, including components of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex. We show that deregulation of pre-mRNA cleavage impairs replication fork speed and leads to excessive origin activity, rendering cells highly dependent on ATR function. While excessive formation of RNA:DNA hybrids under these conditions was tightly associated with replication-stress-induced DNA damage, inhibition of transcription rescued fork speed, origin activation, and alleviated replication catastrophe. Uncoupling of pre-mRNA cleavage from co-transcriptional processing and export also protected cells from replication-stress-associated DNA damage, suggesting that pre-mRNA cleavage provides a mechanism to efficiently release nascent transcripts and thereby prevent gene gating-associated genomic instability."	0
"32320647"	"Dopaminergic Control of Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Underlies Cocaine-Induced Psychostimulation.Cocaine drastically elevates dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, a brain region that is critical to the psychomotor and rewarding properties of the drug. DA signaling regulates intrastriatal circuits connecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) with afferent fibers and interneurons. While the cocaine-mediated increase in DA signaling on MSNs is well documented, that on cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) has been more difficult to assess. Using combined pharmacological, chemogenetic, and cell-specific ablation approaches, we reveal that the D2R-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is fundamental to cocaine-induced changes in behavior and the striatal genomic response. We show that the D2R-dependent control of striatal ChIs enables the motor, sensitized, and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This study highlights the importance of the DA- and D2R-mediated inhibitory control of ChIs activity in the normal functioning of striatal networks."	0

TM7x was the only cultivated member of the candidate phyla radiation (CPR), estimated to encompass 26% of the domain Bacteria. Here we report on divergent genomes from major lineages across the Saccharibacteria phylum in humans and mammals, as well as from ancient dental calculus. These lineages are present at high prevalence within hosts. Direct imaging reveals that all groups are ultra-small in size, likely feeding off commensal bacteria. Analyses suggest that multiple acquisition events in the past led to the current wide diversity, with convergent evolution of key functions allowing Saccharibacteria from the environment to adapt to mammals. Ultra-small, parasitic CPR bacteria represent a relatively unexplored paradigm of prokaryotic interactions within mammalian microbiomes."	0
"32023454"	"BLM has Contrary Effects on Repeat-Mediated Deletions, based on the Distance of DNA DSBs to a Repeat and Repeat Divergence.Repeat-mediated deletions (RMDs) often involve repetitive elements (e.g., short interspersed elements) with sequence divergence that is separated by several kilobase pairs (kbps). We have examined RMDs induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) under varying conditions of repeat sequence divergence (identical versus 1% and 3% divergent) and DSB/repeat distance (16 bp-28.4 kbp). We find that the BLM helicase promotes RMDs with long DSB/repeat distances (e.g., 28.4 kbp), which is consistent with a role in extensive DSB end resection, because the resection nucleases EXO1 and DNA2 affect RMDs similarly to BLM. In contrast, BLM suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence and intermediate (e.g., 3.3 kbp) DSB/repeat distances, which supports a role in heteroduplex rejection. The role of BLM in heteroduplex rejection is not epistatic with MSH2 and is independent of the annealing factor RAD52. Accordingly, the role of BLM on RMDs is substantially affected by DSB/repeat distance and repeat sequence divergence."	0
"32348752"	"The Mitochondrial Import Complex MIM Functions as Main Translocase for α-Helical Outer Membrane Proteins.The mitochondrial outer membrane contains integral proteins with α-helical membrane anchors or a transmembrane β-barrel. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) cooperates with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) in the import of β-barrel proteins, whereas the mitochondrial import (MIM) complex inserts precursors of multi-spanning α-helical proteins. Single-spanning proteins constitute more than half of the integral outer membrane proteins; however, their biogenesis is poorly understood. We report that the yeast MIM complex promotes the insertion of proteins with N-terminal (signal-anchored) or C-terminal (tail-anchored) membrane anchors. The MIM complex exists in three dynamic populations. MIM interacts with TOM to accept precursor proteins from the receptor Tom70. Free MIM complexes insert single-spanning proteins that are imported in a Tom70-independent manner. Finally, coupling of MIM and SAM promotes early assembly steps of TOM subunits. We conclude that the MIM complex is a major and versatile protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane."	0

While mutations in the kelch propeller domain (K13 mutations) are associated with artemisinin resistance, a range of evidence suggests that other factors are critical for the establishment and subsequent transmission of resistance in the field. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of DNA damage and repair in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and find a strong link between enhanced DNA damage repair and artemisinin resistance. This experimental observation is further supported when variations in seven known DNA repair genes are found in resistant parasites, with six of these mutations being associated with K13 mutations. Our data provide important insights on confounding factors that are important for the establishment and spread of artemisinin resistance and may explain why resistance has not yet arisen in Africa."	0

HIV infection in adults depletes circulating ILCs, but the impact on children infected from birth remains unknown. We study vertically HIV-infected children from birth to adulthood and find severe and persistent depletion of all circulating ILCs that, unlike CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, are not restored by long-term antiretroviral therapy unless initiated at birth. Remaining ILCs upregulate genes associated with cellular activation and metabolic perturbation. Unlike HIV-infected adults, ILCs are also profoundly depleted in tonsils of vertically infected children. Transcriptional profiling of remaining ILCs reveals ongoing cell-type-specific activity despite antiretroviral therapy. Collectively, these data suggest an important and ongoing role for ILCs in lymphoid tissue of HIV-infected children from birth, where persistent depletion and sustained transcriptional activity are likely to have long-term immune consequences that merit further investigation."	0

Cells have different ways to prevent R-loop accumulation. One mechanism relies on the conserved THO complex in association with cotranscriptional RNA processing factors including the RNA-dependent ATPase UAP56/DDX39B and histone modifiers such as the SIN3 deacetylase in humans. We investigated the function of UAP56/DDX39B in R-loop removal. We show that UAP56 depletion causes R-loop accumulation, R-loop-mediated genome instability, and replication fork stalling. We demonstrate an RNA-DNA helicase activity in UAP56 and show that its overexpression suppresses R loops and genome instability induced by depleting five different unrelated factors. UAP56/DDX39B localizes to active chromatin and prevents the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids over the entire genome. We propose that, in addition to its RNA processing role, UAP56/DDX39B is a key helicase required to eliminate harmful cotranscriptional RNA structures that otherwise would block transcription and replication."	0

Heterozygous mutations in the SMARCA2 ATPase cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), an intellectual disability syndrome associated with delayed speech onset. We engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to carry NCBRS-associated heterozygous SMARCA2 K755R or R1159Q mutations. While SMARCA2 mutant hESCs were phenotypically normal, differentiation to neural progenitors cells (NPCs) was severely impaired. We find that SMARCA2 mutations cause enhancer reorganization with loss of SOX3-dependent neural enhancers and prominent emergence of astrocyte-specific de novo enhancers. Changes in chromatin accessibility at enhancers were associated with an increase in SMARCA2 binding and retargeting of SMARCA4. We show that the AP-1 family member FRA2 is aberrantly overexpressed in SMARCA2 mutant NPCs, where it functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers. Together, our results demonstrate that SMARCA2 mutations cause impaired differentiation through enhancer reprogramming via inappropriate targeting of SMARCA4."	0

Here, we show that tumor cells employ DNA-damage-induced nuclear caspase-8 to override the p53-dependent G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Caspase-8 is upregulated and localized to the nucleus in multiple human cancers, correlating with treatment resistance and poor clinical outcome. Depletion of caspase-8 causes G2/M arrest, stabilization of p53, and induction of p53-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in tumor cells. In the nucleus, caspase-8 cleaves and inactivates the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28), preventing USP28 from de-ubiquitinating and stabilizing wild-type p53. This results in de facto p53 protein loss, switching cell fate from apoptosis toward mitosis. In summary, our work identifies a non-canonical role of caspase-8 exploited by cancer cells to override the p53-dependent G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint."	1

How these proteins interface with CMG to execute these functions is poorly understood. Here we present 3 to 3.5 Å resolution electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures comprising CMG, Ctf4, and the fork protection complex at a replication fork. The structures provide high-resolution views of CMG-DNA interactions, revealing a mechanism for strand separation, and show Csm3/Tof1 ""grip"" duplex DNA ahead of CMG via a network of interactions important for efficient replication fork pausing.

Here, transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b are shown to be essential for midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron excitatory synaptic inputs and dendritic development. Strikingly, conditional knockout (cKO) of Lmx1a/b in postmitotic mDA neurons results in marked hyperactivity. In seeking Lmx1a/b target genes, we identify positively regulated Slitrk2 and negatively regulated Slitrk5. These two synaptic adhesion proteins promote excitatory and inhibitory synapses on mDA neurons, respectively. Knocking down Slitrk2 reproduces some of the Lmx1a/b cKO cellular and behavioral phenotypes, whereas Slitrk5 knockdown has opposite effects. The hyperactivity caused by this imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs on dopamine neurons is reproduced by chronically inhibiting the ventral tegmental area during development using pharmacogenetics. Our study shows that alterations in developing dopaminergic circuits strongly impact locomotor activity, shedding light on mechanisms causing hyperactivity behaviors."	0

PAICS is overexpressed in many cancers and could be a promising target for the development of cancer therapeutics.

Using crystal structures, we show that the phosphorylation hotspot domain of RyR2 embraces the PKA catalytic subunit, with an extensive interface not seen in PKA complexes with peptides. We trapped an intermediary open-form PKA bound to the RyR2 domain and an ATP analog, showing that PKA can engage substrates in an open form. Phosphomimetics or prior phosphorylation at nearby sites in RyR2 either enhance or reduce the activity of PKA.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an initiation site for autophagosomes and is also remodeled in response to nutrient stress through ER-phagy, a form of selective autophagy. Quantitative proteome analysis during nutrient stress identified an unstudied single-pass transmembrane ER protein, TEX264, as an ER-phagy receptor. TEX264 uses an LC3-interacting region (LIR) to traffic into ATG8-positive puncta that often initiate from three-way ER tubule junctions and subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Interaction and proximity biotinylation proteomics identified a cohort of autophagy regulatory proteins and cargo adaptors located near TEX264 in an LIR-dependent manner. Global proteomics and ER-phagy flux analysis revealed the stabilization of a cohort of ER proteins in TEX264<sup>-/-</sup> cells during nutrient stress.

Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth ∼1 year later.

We used genomics, genetic, biochemical, and microscopic approaches to dissect their interplay in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that FACT and H2Bub globally repress antisense transcripts near the 5' end of genes and inside gene bodies, respectively. The accumulation of these transcripts is accompanied by changes at genic nucleosomes and Pol II redistribution. H2Bub is required for FACT activity in genic regions. In the H2Bub mutant, FACT binding to chromatin is altered and its association with histones is stabilized, which leads to the reduction of genic nucleosomes.

However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Using a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target gene repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This preferentially affected PRC2.2 variant with respect to PRC2.1, destabilizing canonical PRC1 activity. Finally, we found that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched. Overall, our data place H2AK119ub1 deposition as a central hub that mounts PcG repressive machineries to preserve cell transcriptional identity."	0
"30738704"	"Dual Role of Mitochondrial Porin in Metabolite Transport across the Outer Membrane and Protein Transfer to the Inner Membrane.The mitochondrial inner membrane harbors a large number of metabolite carriers. The precursors of carrier proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the carrier translocase of the inner membrane (TIM22). Molecular chaperones in the cytosol and intermembrane space bind to the hydrophobic precursors to prevent their aggregation. We report that the major metabolite channel of the outer membrane, termed porin or voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), promotes efficient import of carrier precursors. Porin interacts with carrier precursors arriving in the intermembrane space and recruits TIM22 complexes, thus ensuring an efficient transfer of the precursors to the inner membrane translocase. Porin channel mutants impaired in metabolite transport are not disturbed in carrier import into mitochondria. We conclude that porin serves distinct functions as outer membrane channel for metabolites and as coupling factor for protein translocation into the inner membrane."	0

Bone marrow microenvironment contains a large number of adipocytes with a still ill-defined role. This study aims to analyze the influence of adipocytes and increased medullar adiposity in megakaryopoiesis. An in vivo increased medullar adiposity in mice caused by high-fat-diet-induced obesity is associated to an enhanced MK maturation and proplatelet formation. In vitro co-culture of adipocytes with bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors shows that delipidation of adipocytes directly supports MK maturation by enhancing polyploidization, amplifying the demarcation membrane system, and accelerating proplatelet formation. This direct crosstalk between adipocytes and MKs occurs through adipocyte fatty acid transfer to MKs involving CD36 to reinforce megakaryocytic maturation. Thus, these findings unveil an influence of adiposity on MK homeostasis based on a dialogue between adipocytes and MKs."	0
"31952990"	"R-Loop Mediated trans Action of the APOLO Long Noncoding RNA.In eukaryotes, three-dimensional genome organization is critical for transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can modulate chromatin conformation of spatially related genomic locations within the nucleus. Here, we show that the lncRNA APOLO (AUXIN-REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP) recognizes multiple distant independent loci in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. We found that APOLO targets are not spatially associated in the nucleus and that APOLO recognizes its targets by short sequence complementarity and the formation of DNA-RNA duplexes (R-loops). The invasion of APOLO to the target DNA decoys the plant Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 component LHP1, modulating local chromatin 3D conformation. APOLO lncRNA coordinates the expression of distal unrelated auxin-responsive genes during lateral root development in Arabidopsis. Hence, R-loop formation and chromatin protein decoy mediate trans action of lncRNAs on distant loci. VIDEO ABSTRACT."	0
"32661339"	"Persistence of a regeneration-associated, transitional alveolar epithelial cell state in pulmonary fibrosis.Stem cells undergo dynamic changes in response to injury to regenerate lost cells. However, the identity of transitional states and the mechanisms that drive their trajectories remain understudied. Using lung organoids, multiple in vivo repair models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we find that alveolar type-2 epithelial cells undergoing differentiation into type-1 cells acquire pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS) en route to terminal maturation. Transitional cells undergo extensive stretching during differentiation, making them vulnerable to DNA damage. Cells in the PATS show an enrichment of TP53, TGFβ, DNA-damage-response signalling and cellular senescence. Gain and loss of function as well as genomic binding assays revealed a direct transcriptional control of PATS by TP53 signalling. Notably, accumulation of PATS-like cells in human fibrotic lungs was observed, suggesting persistence of the transitional state in fibrosis. Our study thus implicates a transient state associated with senescence in normal epithelial tissue repair and its abnormal persistence in disease conditions."	0
"32017898"	"The Alazami Syndrome-Associated Protein LARP7 Guides U6 Small Nuclear RNA Modification and Contributes to Splicing Robustness.The La-related protein 7 (LARP7) forms a complex with the nuclear 7SK RNA to regulate RNA polymerase II transcription. It has been implicated in cancer and the Alazami syndrome, a severe developmental disorder. Here, we report a so far unknown role of this protein in RNA modification. We show that LARP7 physically connects the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) with a distinct subset of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guiding U6 2'-O-methylation. Consistently, these modifications are severely compromised in the absence of LARP7. Although general splicing remains largely unaffected, transcriptome-wide analysis revealed perturbations in alternative splicing in LARP7-depleted cells. Importantly, we identified defects in 2'-O-methylation of the U6 snRNA in Alazami syndrome siblings carrying a LARP7 mutation. Our data identify LARP7 as a bridging factor for snoRNA-guided modification of the U6 snRNA and suggest that alterations in splicing fidelity contribute to the etiology of the Alazami syndrome."	1
"30709710"	"A Functional Mini-Integrase in a Two-Protein-type V-C CRISPR System.CRISPR-Cas immunity requires integration of short, foreign DNA fragments into the host genome at the CRISPR locus, a site consisting of alternating repeat sequences and foreign-derived spacers. In most CRISPR systems, the proteins Cas1 and Cas2 form the integration complex and are both essential for DNA acquisition. Most type V-C and V-D systems lack the cas2 gene and have unusually short CRISPR repeats and spacers. Here, we show that a mini-integrase comprising the type V-C Cas1 protein alone catalyzes DNA integration with a preference for short (17- to 19-base-pair) DNA fragments. The mini-integrase has weak specificity for the CRISPR array. We present evidence that the Cas1 proteins form a tetramer for integration. Our findings support a model of a minimal integrase with an internal ruler mechanism that favors shorter repeats and spacers. This minimal integrase may represent the function of the ancestral Cas1 prior to Cas2 adoption."	0
"30554948"	"The F-Box Domain-Dependent Activity of EMI1 Regulates PARPi Sensitivity in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers.The BRCA1-BRCA2-RAD51 axis is essential for homologous recombination repair (HRR) and is frequently disrupted in breast cancers. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are used clinically to treat BRCA-mutated breast tumors. Using a genetic screen, we identified EMI1 as a modulator of PARPi sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This function requires the F-box domain of EMI1, through which EMI1 assembles a canonical SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that constitutively targets RAD51 for degradation. In response to genotoxic stress, CHK1-mediated phosphorylation of RAD51 counteracts EMI1-dependent degradation by enhancing RAD51's affinity for BRCA2, leading to RAD51 accumulation. Inhibition of RAD51 degradation restores HRR in BRCA1-depleted cells. Human breast cancer samples display an inverse correlation between EMI1 and RAD51 protein levels. A subset of BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells develop resistance to PARPi by downregulating EMI1 and restoring RAD51-dependent HRR. Notably, reconstitution of EMI1 expression reestablishes PARPi sensitivity both in cellular systems and in an orthotopic mouse model."	1
"32521258"	"Rab7-Mediated Endocytosis Establishes Patterning of Wnt Activity through Inactivation of Dkk Antagonism.Endocytosis has been proposed to modulate cell signaling activities. However, the role of endocytosis in embryogenesis, which requires coordination of multiple signaling inputs, has remained less understood. We previously showed that mouse embryos lacking a small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein Rab7 implicated in endocytic flow are defective in gastrulation. Here, we investigate how subcellular defects associated with Rab7 deficiency are related to the observed developmental defects. Rab7-deficient embryos fail to organize mesodermal tissues due to defects in Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Visceral endoderm (VE)-specific ablation of Rab7 results in patterning defects similar to systemic Rab7 deletion. Rab7 mutants accumulate the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 in the extracellular space and in intracellular compartments throughout the VE epithelium. These data indicate that Rab7-dependent endocytosis regulates the concentration and availability of extracellular Dkk1, thereby relieving the epiblast of antagonism. This intercellular mechanism therefore organizes distinct spatiotemporal patterns of canonical Wnt activity during the peri-gastrulation stages of embryonic development."	0

"32783944"	"Single-Cell Profiling Shows Murine Forebrain Neural Stem Cells Reacquire a Developmental State when Activated for Adult Neurogenesis.The transitions from developing to adult quiescent and activated neural stem cells (NSCs) are not well understood. Here, we use single-cell transcriptional profiling and lineage tracing to characterize these transitions in the murine forebrain. We show that the two forebrain NSC parental populations, embryonic cortex and ganglionic eminence radial precursors (RPs), are highly similar even though they make glutamatergic versus gabaergic neurons. Both RP populations progress linearly to transition from a highly active embryonic to a dormant adult stem cell state that still shares many similarities with embryonic RPs. When adult NSCs of either embryonic origin become reactivated to make gabaergic neurons, they acquire a developing ganglionic eminence RP-like identity. Thus, transitions from embryonic RPs to adult NSCs and back to neuronal progenitors do not involve fundamental changes in cell identity, but rather reflect conversions between activated and dormant NSC states that may be determined by the niche environment."	0
"32268085"	"Loss of Thymine DNA Glycosylase Causes Dysregulation of Bile Acid Homeostasis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that plays an essential role in the maintenance of epigenetic stability in cells. Here, we demonstrate that the conditional deletion of TDG in adult mice results in a male-predominant onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TDG loss leads to a prediabetic state, as well as bile acid (BA) accumulation in the liver and serum of male mice. Consistent with these data, TDG deletion led to dysregulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulatory cascade in the liver. FXR and SHP are tumor suppressors of HCC and play an essential role in BA and glucose homeostasis. These results indicate that TDG functions as a tumor suppressor of HCC by regulating a transcriptional program that protects against the development of glucose intolerance and BA accumulation in the liver."	0
"31564557"	"Targeting Spt5-Pol II by Small-Molecule Inhibitors Uncouples Distinct Activities and Reveals Additional Regulatory Roles.Spt5 is a conserved and essential transcription elongation factor that promotes promoter-proximal pausing, promoter escape, elongation, and mRNA processing. Spt5 plays specific roles in the transcription of inflammation and stress-induced genes and tri-nucleotide expanded-repeat genes involved in inherited neurological pathologies. Here, we report the identification of Spt5-Pol II small-molecule inhibitors (SPIs). SPIs faithfully reproduced Spt5 knockdown effects on promoter-proximal pausing, NF-κB activation, and expanded-repeat huntingtin gene transcription. Using SPIs, we identified Spt5 target genes that responded with profoundly diverse kinetics. SPIs uncovered the regulatory role of Spt5 in metabolism via GDF15, a food intake- and body weight-inhibitory hormone. SPIs further unveiled a role for Spt5 in promoting the 3' end processing of histone genes. While several SPIs affect all Spt5 functions, a few inhibit a single one, implying uncoupling and selective targeting of Spt5 activities. SPIs expand the understanding of Spt5-Pol II functions and are potential drugs against metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases."	0
"32433955"	"Optogenetic Activation of Striatopallidal Neurons Reveals Altered HCN Gating in DYT1 Dystonia.Firing activity of external globus pallidus (GPe) is crucial for motor control and is severely perturbed in dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions. Here, we show that GPe projection neurons exhibit a reduction of firing frequency and an irregular pattern in a DYT1 dystonia model. Optogenetic activation of the striatopallidal pathway fails to reset pacemaking activity of GPe neurons in mutant mice. Abnormal firing is paralleled by alterations in motor learning. We find that loss of dopamine D2 receptor-dependent inhibition causes increased GABA input at striatopallidal synapses, with subsequent downregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. Accordingly, enhancing in vivo HCN channel activity or blocking GABA release restores both the ability of striatopallidal inputs to pause ongoing GPe activity and motor coordination deficits. Our findings demonstrate an impaired striatopallidal connectivity, supporting the central role of GPe in motor control and, more importantly, identifying potential pharmacological targets for dystonia."	0
"32348755"	"A Human Antibody Neutralizes Different Flaviviruses by Using Different Mechanisms.Human antibody SIgN-3C neutralizes dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) differently. DENV:SIgN-3C Fab and ZIKV:SIgN-3C Fab cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) complex structures show Fabs crosslink E protein dimers at extracellular pH 8.0 condition and also when further incubated at acidic endosomal conditions (pH 8.0-6.5). We observe Fab binding to DENV (pH 8.0-5.0) prevents virus fusion, and the number of bound Fabs increase (from 120 to 180). For ZIKV, although there are already 180 copies of Fab at pH 8.0, virus structural changes at pH 5.0 are not inhibited. The immunoglobulin G (IgG):DENV structure at pH 8.0 shows both Fab arms bind to epitopes around the 2-fold vertex. On ZIKV, an additional Fab around the 5-fold vertex at pH 8.0 suggests one IgG arm would engage with an epitope, although the other may bind to other viruses, causing aggregation. For DENV2 at pH 5.0, a similar scenario would occur, suggesting DENV2:IgG complex would aggregate in the endosome. Hence, a single antibody employs different neutralization mechanisms against different flaviviruses."	0
"32209478"	"Phospholipase D1 Ablation Disrupts Mouse Longitudinal Hippocampal Axis Organization and Functioning.Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a signaling lipid involved in the modulation of synaptic structure and functioning. Based on previous work showing a decreasing PA gradient along the longitudinal axis of the rodent hippocampus, we asked whether the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and the ventral hippocampus (VH) are differentially affected by PA modulation. Here, we show that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is a major hippocampal PA source, compared to PLD2, and that PLD1 ablation affects predominantly the lipidome of the DH. Moreover, Pld1 knockout (KO) mice show specific deficits in novel object recognition and social interaction and disruption in the DH-VH dendritic arborization differentiation in CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons. Also, Pld1 KO animals present reduced long-term depression (LTD) induction and reduced GluN2A and SNAP-25 protein levels in the DH. Overall, we observe that PLD1-derived PA reduction leads to differential lipid signatures along the longitudinal hippocampal axis, predominantly affecting DH organization and functioning."	0
"32101744"	"Adaptive Evolution Targets a piRNA Precursor Transcription Network.In Drosophila, transposon-silencing piRNAs are derived from heterochromatic clusters and a subset of euchromatic transposon insertions, which are bound by the Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to Deadlock, which recruits TRF2 to promote non-canonical transcription from both genomic strands. Cuff function is less well understood, but this Rai1 homolog shows hallmarks of adaptive evolution, which can remodel functional interactions within host defense systems. Supporting this hypothesis, Drosophila simulans Cutoff is a dominant-negative allele when expressed in Drosophila melanogaster, in which it traps Deadlock, TRF2, and the conserved transcriptional co-repressor CtBP in stable complexes. Cutoff functions with Rhino and Deadlock to drive non-canonical transcription. In contrast, CtBP suppresses canonical transcription of transposons and promoters flanking the major germline clusters, and canonical transcription interferes with downstream non-canonical transcription and piRNA production. Adaptive evolution thus targets interactions among Cutoff, TRF2, and CtBP that balance canonical and non-canonical piRNA precursor transcription."	0
"32937133"	"Functional Dissection of Basal Ganglia Inhibitory Inputs onto Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons.Substantia nigra (SNc) dopaminergic neurons respond to aversive stimuli with inhibitory pauses in firing followed by transient rebound activation. We tested integration of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto SNc neurons from genetically defined populations in dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and external globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin- and Lhx6-positive), and examined their contribution to pause-rebound firing. Activation of striosome projections, which target ""dendron bouquets"" in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound."	0

Here, we study samples from 46 DENV-naive and 43 DENV-immune patients with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection at early-acute, late-acute, and convalescent time points from our pediatric cohort study in Nicaragua. We analyze the samples via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), CyTOF, and multiplex cytokine/chemokine Luminex to generate a comprehensive, innate immune profile during ZIKV infection. Immunophenotyping and analysis of cytokines/chemokines reveal that CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes play a key role during ZIKV infection. Further, we identify CD169 (Siglec-1) on CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes as a potential biomarker of acute ZIKV infection. Strikingly distinct transcriptomic and immunophenotypic signatures are observed at all three time points. Interestingly, pre-existing dengue immunity has minimal impact on the innate immune response to Zika.

"32868900"	"The primary cilium and lipophagy translate mechanical forces to direct metabolic adaptation of kidney epithelial cells.Organs and cells must adapt to shear stress induced by biological fluids, but how fluid flow contributes to the execution of specific cell programs is poorly understood. Here we show that shear stress favours mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic reprogramming to ensure energy production and cellular adaptation in kidney epithelial cells. Shear stress stimulates lipophagy, contributing to the production of fatty acids that provide mitochondrial substrates to generate ATP through β-oxidation. This flow-induced process is dependent on the primary cilia located on the apical side of epithelial cells. The interplay between fluid flow and lipid metabolism was confirmed in vivo using a unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse model. Finally, primary cilium-dependent lipophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are required to support energy-consuming cellular processes such as glucose reabsorption, gluconeogenesis and cytoskeletal remodelling. Our findings demonstrate how primary cilia and autophagy are involved in the translation of mechanical forces into metabolic adaptation."	0

Here we report the surprising result that visual experience is critical for the alignment of vDSGC dendrites to their preferred direction. Interestingly, vDSGCs in dark-reared mice lose their inhibition-independent dendritic contribution to direction-selective tuning while maintaining asymmetric inhibitory input.

In both structures, UCN1 adopts a single straight helix with its N terminus dipped into the receptor transmembrane bundle. Although the peptide-binding residues in CRF1R and CRF2R are different from other members of class B GPCRs, the residues involved in receptor activation and G protein coupling are conserved. In addition, both structures reveal bound cholesterol molecules to the receptor transmembrane helices.

However, the role of Maidong polysaccharide extract (MPE) in pancreatic β-cell function is unclear. Here, we investigated whether MPE protects β-cell function and studied the underlying mechanisms. We treated <i>db/db</i> and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with 800 or 400 mg/kg MPE or water for 4 weeks, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Pancreas and blood were collected for molecular analyses, and clonal MIN6 β-cells and primary islets from HFD-induced obese mice and normal chow diet-fed mice were used in additional analyses. <i>In vivo</i>, MPE both increased insulin secretion and reduced blood glucose in the <i>db/db</i> mice but increased only insulin secretion in the HFD-induced obese mice. MPE substantially increased the β-cell area in both models (3-fold and 2-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.01, for <i>db/db</i> and HFD mice, respectively). We observed reduced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in islets of MPE-treated db/db mice, coinciding with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). <i>In vitro</i>, MPE potentiated GSIS and decreased interleukin 1β (IL-1β) secretion in MIN6 β-cells. Incubation of MIN6 cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon-γ, and IL-1β amplified IL-1β secretion and inhibited GSIS. These effects were partially reversed with MPE or the IκB kinase β inhibitor PS1145, coinciding with reduced activation of p65 and p-IκB in the NF-κB pathway. We conclude that MPE may have potential for therapeutic development for β-cell protection."	0
"32669362"	"Ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 enhances epidermal growth factor receptor stability and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor resistance.The discovery of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations spurred the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, as the first-line treatment of lung cancers. We previously reported that differential degradation of TKI-sensitive (<i>e.g.</i> L858R) and resistant (T790M) EGFR mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. We also reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> ubiquitination assays, MS, and superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of EGF-bound EGFR, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown increases receptor sorting to lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown decreased EGFR steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive target to overcome TKI resistance."	1

Here we describe a light response pathway in mice that employs encephalopsin (OPN3, a 480 nm, blue-light-responsive opsin) to regulate the function of adipocytes. Germline null and adipocyte-specific conditional null mice show a light- and Opn3-dependent deficit in thermogenesis and become hypothermic upon cold exposure. We show that stimulating mouse adipocytes with blue light enhances the lipolysis response and, in particular, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase. This response is Opn3 dependent. These data establish a key mechanism in which light-dependent, local regulation of the lipolysis response in white adipocytes regulates energy metabolism."	0

Unexpectedly, this complex adopts a dimeric structural architecture, accounting for PRC2 self-association that has long been implicated. The intrinsic PRC2 dimer is formed via domain swapping involving RBBP4 and the unique C2 domain of SUZ12. MTF2 and PHF19 associate with PRC2 at around the dimer interface and stabilize the dimer. Conversely, AEBP2 binding results in a drastic movement of the C2 domain, disrupting the intrinsic PRC2 dimer. PRC2 dimerization enhances CGI DNA binding by PCLs in pairs in vitro, reminiscent of the widespread phenomenon of transcription factor dimerization in active transcription.

Different conditions can be applied in a single device by triggering the merging of new droplets with the spheroid-containing drops. This allows cell-cell interactions to be initiated for building microtissues, studying stem cells' self-organization, or observing antagonistic interactions. It also allows the spheroids' physical or chemical environment to be modulated, as we show by applying a drug over a large range of concentrations in a single parallelized experiment.

Morphological analyses of NvPOU4 mutants crossed to transgenic reporter lines show that the loss of NvPOU4 does not affect the initial specification of neural cells. Transcriptomes derived from the mutants and from different neural cell populations reveal that NvPOU4 is required for the execution of the terminal differentiation program of these neural cells. These findings suggest that POU4 genes have ancient functions as terminal selectors for morphologically and functionally disparate types of neurons and they provide experimental support for the relevance of terminal selectors for understanding the evolution of cell types."	0

Transcriptome analyses of mutant mouse tissues support a role for the cap-specific m<sup>6</sup>Am modification in stabilizing transcripts. In contrast, the Drosophila Pcif1 is catalytically dead, but like its mammalian counterpart, it retains the ability to associate with the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II).

Although many RNA editing sites are known, few trans regulators have been identified. We perform BioID followed by mass spectrometry to identify trans regulators of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in HeLa and M17 neuroblastoma cells. We identify known and novel ADAR-interacting proteins. Using ENCODE data, we validate and characterize a subset of the novel interactors as global or site-specific RNA editing regulators. Our set of novel trans regulators includes all four members of the DZF-domain-containing family of proteins: ILF3, ILF2, STRBP, and ZFR. We show that these proteins interact with each ADAR and modulate RNA editing levels. We find ILF3 is a broadly influential negative regulator of editing. This work demonstrates the broad roles that RNA binding proteins play in regulating editing levels, and establishes DZF-domain-containing proteins as a group of highly influential RNA editing regulators."	1
"32546479"	"Mechanical stretching changes crosslinking and glycation levels in the collagen of mouse tail tendon.Collagen I is a major tendon protein whose polypeptide chains are linked by covalent crosslinks. It is unknown how the crosslinking contributes to the mechanical properties of tendon or whether crosslinking changes in response to stretching or relaxation. Since their discovery, imine bonds within collagen have been recognized as being important in both crosslink formation and collagen structure. They are often described as acidic or thermally labile, but no evidence is available from direct measurements of crosslink levels whether these bonds contribute to the mechanical properties of collagen. Here, we used MS to analyze these imine bonds after reduction with sodium borohydride while under tension and found that their levels are altered in stretched tendon. We studied the changes in crosslink bonding in tail tendon from 11-week-old C57Bl/6 mice at 4% physical strain, at 10% strain, and at breaking point. The crosslinks hydroxy-lysino-norleucine (HLNL), dihydroxy-lysino-norleucine (DHLNL), and lysino-norleucine (LNL) in-creased or decreased depending on the specific crosslink and amount of mechanical strain. We also noted a decrease in glycated lysine residues in collagen, indicating that the imine formed between circulating glucose and lysine is also stress labile. We also carried out mechanical testing, including cyclic testing at 4% strain, stress relaxation tests, and stress-strain profiles taken at breaking point, both with and without sodium borohydride reduction. The results from both the MS studies and mechanical testing provide insights into the chemical changes during tendon stretching and directly link these chemical changes to functional collagen properties."	0

Using genetically engineered mouse models and primary macrophage cultures, we show that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induces the expression of the transcription factor Spic selectively in patrolling monocytes and tissue macrophages by a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent mechanism. Functionally, Spic downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes iron efflux by regulating ferroportin expression in activated macrophages. Notably, interferon-gamma blocks Spic expression in a STAT1-dependent manner. High levels of interferon-gamma are indicative of ongoing infection, and in its absence, activated macrophages appear to engage a ""default"" Spic-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway. We also provide evidence for the engagement of this pathway in sterile inflammation. Taken together, our findings uncover a pathway wherein counter-regulation of Spic by NF-κB and STATs attune inflammatory responses and iron metabolism in macrophages."	1

Recently, we have designed synthetic cytokine receptors (SyCyRs) consisting of GFP and mCherry nanobodies fused to transmembrane and intracellular domains of cytokine receptors that phenocopy cytokine signaling induced by nonphysiological homo- and heterodimeric GFP-mCherry ligands. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) signals via both IL-22 receptor α1 (IL-22Rα1) and the common IL-10R2, belongs to the IL-10 cytokine family, and is critically involved in tissue regeneration. Here, IL-22 SyCyRs phenocopied native IL-22 signal transduction, indicated by induction of cytokine-dependent cellular proliferation, signal transduction, and transcriptome analysis. Whereas homodimeric IL-22Rα1 SyCyRs failed to activate signaling, homodimerization of the second IL-22 signaling chain, SyCyR(IL-10R2), which previously was considered not to induce signal transduction, led to induction of signal transduction. Interestingly, the SyCyR(IL-10R2) and SyCyR(IL-22Rα1) constructs could form functional heterodimeric receptor signaling complexes with the synthetic IL-6 receptor chain SyCyR(gp130). In summary, we have demonstrated that IL-22 signaling can be phenocopied by synthetic cytokine receptors, identified a functional IL-10R2 homodimeric receptor complex, and uncovered broad receptor cross-talk of IL-22Rα1 and IL-20R2 with gp130."	0

During this process, the two-component carnitine monooxygenase (CntAB) catalyzes the oxygen-dependent cleavage of carnitine to TMA and malic semialdehyde. Individual redox states of the reductase CntB and the catalytic component CntA were investigated based on mutagenesis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic approaches. Protein ligands of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and the plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntB and also of the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and the mononuclear [Fe] center of CntA were identified. EPR spectroscopy of variant CntA proteins suggested a hierarchical metallocenter maturation, Rieske [2Fe-2S] followed by the mononuclear [Fe] center. NADH-dependent electron transfer <i>via</i> the redox components of CntB and within the trimeric CntA complex for the activation of molecular oxygen was investigated. EPR experiments indicated that the two electrons from NADH were allocated to the plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and to FMN in the form of a flavin semiquinone radical. Single-turnover experiments of this reduced CntB species indicated the translocation of the first electron onto the [Fe] center and the second electron onto the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntA to finally allow for oxygen activation as a basis for carnitine cleavage. EPR spectroscopic investigation of CntA variants indicated an unusual intermolecular electron transfer between the subunits of the CntA trimer <i>via</i> the ""bridging"" residue Glu-205. On the basis of these data, a redox catalytic cycle for carnitine monooxygenase was proposed."	0

Here, we have developed a cellular model that allows the study of human AD-derived Tau propagation from neuron to neuron using microfluidic devices. We show by using high-content imaging techniques and an in-house developed interactive computer program that human AD-derived Tau seeds rodent Tau that propagates trans-neuronally in a quantifiable manner in a microfluidic culture model. Moreover, we were able to convert this model to a medium-throughput format allowing the user to handle 16 two-chamber devices simultaneously in the footprint of a standard 96-well plate. Furthermore, we show that a small molecule inhibitor of aggregation can block the trans-neuronal transfer of Tau aggregates, suggesting that the system can be used to evaluate mechanisms of Tau transfer and find therapeutic interventions."	0

These recurrent oncohistones induce a global loss of repressive H3K27me3 residues and broad epigenetic dysregulation. In order to identify therapeutically targetable dependencies within this disease context, we performed an RNAi screen targeting epigenetic/chromatin-associated genes in patient-derived DMG cultures. This identified AFF4, the scaffold protein of the super elongation complex (SEC), as a molecular dependency in DMG. Interrogation of SEC function demonstrates a key role for maintaining clonogenic potential while promoting self-renewal of tumor stem cells. Small-molecule inhibition of SEC using clinically relevant CDK9 inhibitors restores regulatory RNA polymerase II pausing, promotes cellular differentiation, and leads to potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. These studies present a rationale for further exploration of SEC inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach to this intractable disease."	0
"32640217"	"Extracellular Granzyme A Promotes Colorectal Cancer Development by Enhancing Gut Inflammation.If not properly regulated, the inflammatory immune response can promote carcinogenesis, as evident in colorectal cancer (CRC). Aiming to gain mechanistic insight into the link between inflammation and CRC, we perform transcriptomics analysis of human CRC, identifying a strong correlation between expression of the serine protease granzyme A (GzmA) and inflammation. In a dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) mouse model, deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of extracellular GzmA both attenuate gut inflammation and prevent CRC development, including the initial steps of cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, extracellular GzmA induces NF-κB-dependent IL-6 production in macrophages, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation in cultured CRC cells. Accordingly, colon tissues from DSS/AOM-treated, GzmA-deficient animals present reduced levels of pSTAT3. By identifying GzmA as a proinflammatory protease that promotes CRC development, these findings provide information on mechanisms that link immune cell infiltration to cancer progression and present GzmA as a therapeutic target for CRC."	1

Although di-BRCT recognition of phospho-proteins is well known to support the genotoxic response, whether multi-BRCT domains can acquire distinct structures and functions is unclear. Here we present the tetra-BRCT structures from the conserved yeast protein Rtt107 in free and ligand-bound forms. The four BRCT repeats fold into a tetrahedral structure that recognizes unmodified ligands using a bi-partite mechanism, suggesting repeat origami enabling function acquisition. Functional studies show that Rtt107 binding of partner proteins of diverse activities promotes genome replication and stability in both distinct and concerted manners. A unified theme is that tetra- and di-BRCT domains of Rtt107 collaborate to recruit partner proteins to chromatin. Our work thus illustrates how a master regulator uses two types of BRCT domains to recognize distinct genome factors and direct them to chromatin for constitutive genome protection."	0

"30852061"	"The Ribosome Cooperates with a Chaperone to Guide Multi-domain Protein Folding.Multi-domain proteins, containing several structural units within a single polypeptide, constitute a large fraction of all proteomes. Co-translational folding is assumed to simplify the conformational search problem for large proteins, but the events leading to correctly folded, functional structures remain poorly characterized. Similarly, how the ribosome and molecular chaperones promote efficient folding remains obscure. Using optical tweezers, we have dissected early folding events of nascent elongation factor G, a multi-domain protein that requires chaperones for folding. The ribosome and the chaperone trigger factor reduce inter-domain misfolding, permitting folding of the N-terminal G-domain. Successful completion of this step is a crucial prerequisite for folding of the next domain. Unexpectedly, co-translational folding does not proceed unidirectionally; emerging unfolded polypeptide can denature an already-folded domain. Trigger factor, but not the ribosome, protects against denaturation. The chaperone thus serves a previously unappreciated function, helping multi-domain proteins overcome inherent challenges during co-translational folding."	0

Despite being extensively studied, how the Polycomb system selects its target genes is poorly understood, and whether its histone-modifying activities are required for transcriptional repression remains controversial. Here, we directly test the requirement for PRC1 catalytic activity in Polycomb system function. To achieve this, we develop a conditional mutation system in embryonic stem cells that completely removes PRC1 catalytic activity. Using this system, we demonstrate that catalysis by PRC1 drives Polycomb chromatin domain formation and long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show that variant PRC1 complexes with DNA-binding activities occupy target sites independently of PRC1 catalytic activity, providing a putative mechanism for Polycomb target site selection. Finally, we discover that Polycomb-mediated gene repression requires PRC1 catalytic activity. Together these discoveries provide compelling evidence that PRC1 catalysis is central to Polycomb system function and gene regulation."	0

Integrative analysis of genome-wide high-resolution chromatin interactions, MYOD and CTCF DNA-binding profile, and gene expression, revealed that MYOD directs extensive re-wiring of interactions involving cis-regulatory and structural genomic elements, including promoters, enhancers, and insulated neighborhoods (INs). Re-configured INs were hot-spots of differential interactions, whereby MYOD binding to highly constrained sequences at IN boundaries and/or inside INs led to alterations of promoter-enhancer interactions to repress cell-of-origin genes and to activate muscle-specific genes. Functional evidence shows that MYOD-directed re-configuration of chromatin interactions temporally preceded the effect on gene expression and was mediated by direct MYOD-DNA binding. These data illustrate a model whereby a single TF alters multi-loop hubs to drive somatic cell trans-differentiation."	0
"31492635"	"PTEN Suppresses Glycolysis by Dephosphorylating and Inhibiting Autophosphorylated PGK1.The PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently mutated or deleted in cancer and regulates glucose metabolism through the PI3K-AKT pathway. However, whether PTEN directly regulates glycolysis in tumor cells is unclear. We demonstrate here that PTEN directly interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1). PGK1 functions not only as a glycolytic enzyme but also as a protein kinase intermolecularly autophosphorylating itself at Y324 for activation. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN dephosphorylates and inhibits autophosphorylated PGK1, thereby inhibiting glycolysis, ATP production, and brain tumor cell proliferation. In addition, knockin expression of a PGK1 Y324F mutant inhibits brain tumor formation. Analyses of human glioblastoma specimens reveals that PGK1 Y324 phosphorylation levels inversely correlate with PTEN expression status and are positively associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. This work highlights the instrumental role of PGK1 autophosphorylation in its activation and PTEN protein phosphatase activity in governing glycolysis and tumorigenesis."	1
"32130890"	"Regulated Proteolysis of MutSγ Controls Meiotic Crossing Over.Crossover recombination is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. The MutSγ complex, Msh4-Msh5, facilitates crossing over by binding and stabilizing nascent recombination intermediates. We show that these activities are governed by regulated proteolysis. MutSγ is initially inactive for crossing over due to an N-terminal degron on Msh4 that renders it unstable by directly targeting proteasomal degradation. Activation of MutSγ requires the Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 (DDK), which directly phosphorylates and thereby neutralizes the Msh4 degron. Genetic requirements for Msh4 phosphorylation indicate that DDK targets MutSγ only after it has bound to nascent joint molecules (JMs) in the context of synapsing chromosomes. Overexpression studies confirm that the steady-state level of Msh4, not phosphorylation per se, is the critical determinant for crossing over. At the DNA level, Msh4 phosphorylation enables the formation and crossover-biased resolution of double-Holliday Junction intermediates. Our study establishes regulated protein degradation as a fundamental mechanism underlying meiotic crossing over."	1

Caspase-1 processes interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 to their mature forms and triggers pyroptosis. These caspase-1 functions are linked to its enzymatic activity. However, loss-of-function missense mutations in CASP1 do not prevent autoinflammation in patients, despite decreased IL-1β production. In vitro data suggest that enzymatically inactive caspase-1 drives inflammation via enhanced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation, independent of IL-1β processing.

"32884147"	"Synthetic immunomodulation with a CRISPR super-repressor in vivo.Transient modulation of the genes involved in immunity, without exerting a permanent change in the DNA code, can be an effective strategy to modulate the course of many inflammatory conditions. CRISPR-Cas9 technology represents a promising platform for achieving this goal. Truncation of guide RNA (gRNA) from the 5' end enables the application of a nuclease competent Cas9 protein for transcriptional modulation of genes, allowing multifunctionality of CRISPR. Here, we introduce an enhanced CRISPR-based transcriptional repressor to reprogram immune homeostasis in vivo. In this repressor system, two transcriptional repressors-heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) and Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-are fused to the MS2 coat protein and subsequently recruited by gRNA aptamer binding to a nuclease competent CRISPR complex containing truncated gRNAs. With the enhanced repressor, we demonstrate transcriptional repression of the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88) gene in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that this strategy can efficiently downregulate Myd88 expression in lung, blood and bone marrow of Cas9 transgenic mice that receive systemic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)2/1-carrying truncated gRNAs targeting Myd88 and the MS2-HP1a-KRAB cassette. This downregulation is accompanied by changes in downstream signalling elements such as TNF-α and ICAM-1. Myd88 repression leads to a decrease in immunoglobulin G (IgG) production against AAV2/1 and AAV2/9 and this strategy modulates the IgG response against AAV cargos. It improves the efficiency of a subsequent AAV9/CRISPR treatment for repression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a gene that, when repressed, can lower blood cholesterol levels. We also demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated Myd88 repression can act as a prophylactic measure against septicaemia in both Cas9 transgenic and C57BL/6J mice. When delivered by nanoparticles, this repressor can serve as a therapeutic modality to influence the course of septicaemia. Collectively, we report that CRISPR-mediated repression of endogenous Myd88 can effectively modulate the host immune response against AAV-mediated gene therapy and influence the course of septicaemia. The ability to control Myd88 transcript levels using a CRISPR-based synthetic repressor can be an effective strategy for AAV-based CRISPR therapies, as this pathway serves as a key node in the induction of humoral immunity against AAV serotypes."	0

We report that PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase is a negative regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation rate. The PNUTS W401A mutation, which disrupts PP1 binding, causes genome-wide acceleration of transcription associated with hyper-phosphorylation of the Spt5 elongation factor. Immediately downstream of poly(A) sites, Pol II decelerates from >2 kb/min to <1 kb/min, which correlates with Spt5 dephosphorylation. Pol II deceleration and Spt5 dephosphorylation require poly(A) site recognition and the PNUTS-PP1 complex, which is in turn necessary for transcription termination. These results lead to a model for termination, the ""sitting duck torpedo"" mechanism, where poly(A) site-dependent deceleration caused by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 dephosphorylation is required to convert Pol II into a viable target for the Xrn2 terminator exonuclease.

Using muscle-specific emerin Dam-ID in worms, we monitored the effects of the mutation on endogenous chromatin. An increased contact with the nuclear periphery along chromosome arms, and an enhanced release of chromosomal centers, coincided with the disease phenotypes of reduced locomotion and compromised sarcomere integrity. The coupling of the LMN-Y59C mutation with the ablation of CEC-4, a chromodomain protein that anchors H3K9-methylated chromatin at the nuclear envelope (NE), suppressed the muscle-associated disease phenotypes. Deletion of <i>cec-4</i> also rescued LMN-Y59C-linked alterations in chromatin organization and some changes in transcription. Sequences that changed position in the LMN-Y59C mutant, are enriched for E2F (EFL-2)-binding sites, consistent with previous studies suggesting that altered Rb-E2F interaction with lamin A may contribute to muscle dysfunction. In summary, we were able to counteract the dominant muscle-specific defects provoked by LMNA mutation by the ablation of a lamin-associated H3K9me anchor, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for EDMD."	0

"32433958"	"Retinoid X Receptor α Regulates DHA-Dependent Spinogenesis and Functional Synapse Formation In Vivo.Coordinated intracellular and extracellular signaling is critical to synapse development and functional neural circuit wiring. Here, we report that unesterified docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) regulates functional synapse formation in vivo via retinoid X receptor α (Rxra) signaling. Using Rxra conditional knockout (cKO) mice and virus-mediated transient gene expression, we show that endogenous Rxra plays important roles in regulating spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical pyramidal neurons. We further show that the effects of RXRA are mediated through its DNA-binding domain in a cell-autonomous and reversible manner. Moreover, unesterified DHA increases spine formation and excitatory synaptic transmission in vivo in an Rxra-dependent fashion. Rxra cKO mice generally behave normally but show deficits in behavior tasks associated with social memory. Together, these results demonstrate that unesterified DHA signals through RXRA to regulate spinogenesis and functional synapse formation, providing insight into the mechanism through which DHA promotes brain development and cognitive function."	0
"32049019"	"Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation Regulates the Fate Decision between Pathogenic Th17 and Regulatory T Cells.Understanding metabolic pathways that regulate Th17 development is important to broaden therapeutic options for Th17-mediated autoimmunity. Here, we report a pivotal role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for lineage specification toward pathogenic Th17 differentiation. Th17 cells rapidly increase mitochondrial respiration during development, and this is necessary for metabolic reprogramming following T cell activation. Surprisingly, specific inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase ablates Th17 pathogenicity in a mouse model of autoimmunity by preventing Th17 pathogenic signature gene expression. Notably, cells activated under OXPHOS-inhibited Th17 conditions preferentially express Foxp3, rather than Th17 genes, and become suppressive Treg cells. Mechanistically, OXPHOS promotes the Th17 pioneer transcription factor, BATF, and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) and mTOR signaling. Correspondingly, overexpression of BATF rescues Th17 development when ATP synthase activity is restricted. Together, our data reveal a regulatory role of mitochondrial OXPHOS in dictating the fate decision between Th17 and Treg cells by supporting early molecular events necessary for Th17 commitment."	0
"32402271"	"The Histone Methyltransferase G9a Controls Axon Growth by Targeting the RhoA Signaling Pathway.The generation of axonal and dendritic domains is critical for brain circuitry assembly and physiology. Negative players, such as the RhoA-Rho coiled-coil-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway, restrain axon development and polarization. Surprisingly, the genetic control of neuronal polarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report that, in primary cultured neurons, expression of the histone methyltransferase G9a and nuclear translocation of its major splicing isoform (G9a/E10+) peak at the time of axon formation. RNAi suppression of G9a/E10+ or pharmacological blockade of G9a constrains neuronal migration, axon initiation, and the establishment of neuronal polarity in situ and in vitro. Inhibition of G9a function upregulates RhoA-ROCK activity by increasing the expression of Lfc, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA. Together, these results identify G9a as a player in neuronal polarization."	1
"32579928"	"Fibroblast-Derived STC-1 Modulates Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Lung Adenocarcinoma Development.The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of different cell types, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). How these cells interact and contribute to lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. Using <sup>G12D</sup>KRAS- and <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF-driven mouse lung models, we identify the pleiotropic glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a regulator of TAM-TAF interactions. STC1 is secreted by TAFs and suppresses TAM differentiation, at least in part, by sequestering the binding of GRP94, an autocrine macrophage-differentiation-inducing factor, to its cognate scavenger receptors. The accumulation of mature TAMs in the Stc1-deficient lung leads to enhanced secretion of TGF-β1 and, thus, TAF accumulation in the TME. Consistent with the mouse data, in human lung adenocarcinoma, STC1 expression is restricted to myofibroblasts, and a significant increase of naive macrophages is detected in STC1-high compared with STC1-low cases. This work increases our understanding of lung adenocarcinoma development and suggests new approaches for therapeutic targeting of the TME."	1
"32521263"	"Rapid and Efficient Invasion Assay of Glioblastoma in Human Brain Organoids.Glioblastoma (GBM) possesses glioma stem cells (GSCs) that exhibit aggressive invasion behavior in the brain. Current preclinical GBM invasion assays using mouse brain xenografts are time consuming and less efficient. Here, we demonstrate an array of methods that allow rapid and efficient assaying of GSCs invasion in human brain organoids. The assays are versatile to characterize various aspects of GSCs, such as invasion, integration, and interaction with mature neurons of brain organoids. Tissue clearing and quantitative 3D imaging of GSCs in host organoids reveal that invasiveness is inversely correlated with the organoids' age. Importantly, the described invasion assays can distinguish the invasive behaviors of primary and recurrent GSCs. The assays are also amenable to test pharmacological agents. As an example, we show that GI254023X, an inhibitor of ADAM10, could prevent the integration of GSCs into the organoids."	0
"32320669"	"Beta-Catenin Causes Adrenal Hyperplasia by Blocking Zonal Transdifferentiation.Activating mutations in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway are key drivers of hyperplasia, the gateway for tumor development. In a wide range of tissues, this occurs primarily through enhanced effects on cellular proliferation. Whether additional mechanisms contribute to β-catenin-driven hyperplasia remains unknown. The adrenal cortex is an ideal system in which to explore this question, as it undergoes hyperplasia following somatic β-catenin gain-of-function (βcat-GOF) mutations. Targeting βcat-GOF to zona Glomerulosa (zG) cells leads to a progressive hyperplastic expansion in the absence of increased proliferation. Instead, we find that hyperplasia results from a functional block in the ability of zG cells to transdifferentiate into zona Fasciculata (zF) cells. Mechanistically, zG cells demonstrate an upregulation of Pde2a, an inhibitor of zF-specific cAMP/PKA signaling. Hyperplasia is further exacerbated by trophic factor stimulation leading to organomegaly. Together, these data indicate that β-catenin drives adrenal hyperplasia through both proliferation-dependent and -independent mechanisms."	0
"31473101"	"Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 2 Recruits Replication Protein A to Sites of LINE-1 Integration to Facilitate Retrotransposition.Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a threat to genome integrity, and cells have evolved mechanisms to restrict retrotransposition. However, how cellular proteins facilitate L1 retrotransposition requires elucidation. Here, we demonstrate that single-strand DNA breaks induced by the L1 endonuclease trigger the recruitment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP2) to L1 integration sites and that PARP2 activation leads to the subsequent recruitment of the replication protein A (RPA) complex to facilitate retrotransposition. We further demonstrate that RPA directly binds activated PARP2 through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and can protect single-strand L1 integration intermediates from APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination in vitro. Paradoxically, we provide evidence that RPA can guide APOBEC3A, and perhaps other APOBEC3 proteins, to sites of L1 integration. Thus, the interplay of L1-encoded and evolutionarily conserved cellular proteins is required for efficient retrotransposition; however, these interactions also may be exploited to restrict L1 retrotransposition in the human genome."	0
"31324450"	"Multidomain Convergence of Argonaute during RISC Assembly Correlates with the Formation of Internal Water Clusters.Despite the relevance of Argonaute proteins in RNA silencing, little is known about the structural steps of small RNA loading to form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). We report the 1.9 Å crystal structure of human Argonaute4 with guide RNA. Comparison with the previously determined apo structure of Neurospora crassa QDE2 revealed that the PIWI domain has two subdomains. Binding of guide RNA fastens the subdomains, thereby rearranging the active-site residues and increasing the affinity for TNRC6 proteins. We also identified two water pockets beneath the nucleic acid-binding channel that appeared to stabilize the mature RISC. Indeed, mutating the water-pocket residues of Argonaute2 and Argonaute4 compromised RISC assembly. Simulations predict that internal water molecules are exchangeable with the bulk solvent but always occupy specific positions at the domain interfaces. These results suggest that after guide RNA-driven conformational changes, water-mediated hydrogen-bonding networks tie together the converged domains to complete the functional RISC structure."	0
"32521255"	"Mature Retina Compensates Functionally for Partial Loss of Rod Photoreceptors.Loss of primary neuronal inputs inevitably strikes every neural circuit. The deafferented circuit could propagate, amplify, or mitigate input loss, thus affecting the circuit's output. How the deafferented circuit contributes to the effect on the output is poorly understood because of lack of control over loss of and access to circuit elements. Here, we control the timing and degree of rod photoreceptor ablation in mature mouse retina and uncover compensation. Following loss of half of the rods, rod bipolar cells mitigate the loss by preserving voltage output. Such mitigation allows partial recovery of ganglion cell responses. We conclude that rod death is compensated for in the circuit because ganglion cell responses to stimulation of half of the rods in an unperturbed circuit are weaker than responses after death of half of the rods. The dominant mechanism of such compensation includes homeostatic regulation of inhibition to balance the loss of excitation."	0
"31914384"	"Distinct Pathogenic Genes Causing Intellectual Disability and Autism Exhibit a Common Neuronal Network Hyperactivity Phenotype.Pathogenic mutations in either one of the epigenetic modifiers EHMT1, MBD5, MLL3, or SMARCB1 have been identified to be causative for Kleefstra syndrome spectrum (KSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical features of both intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To understand how these variants lead to the phenotypic convergence in KSS, we employ a loss-of-function approach to assess neuronal network development at the molecular, single-cell, and network activity level. KSS-gene-deficient neuronal networks all develop into hyperactive networks with altered network organization and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Interestingly, even though transcriptional data reveal distinct regulatory mechanisms, KSS target genes share similar functions in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function, several of which are associated with ID and ASD. Our results show that KSS genes mainly converge at the level of neuronal network communication, providing insights into the pathophysiology of KSS and phenotypically congruent disorders."	0
"31805521"	"Set1/COMPASS repels heterochromatin invasion at euchromatic sites by disrupting Suv39/Clr4 activity and nucleosome stability.Protection of euchromatin from invasion by gene-repressive heterochromatin is critical for cellular health and viability. In addition to constitutive loci such as pericentromeres and subtelomeres, heterochromatin can be found interspersed in gene-rich euchromatin, where it regulates gene expression pertinent to cell fate. While heterochromatin and euchromatin are globally poised for mutual antagonism, the mechanisms underlying precise spatial encoding of heterochromatin containment within euchromatic sites remain opaque. We investigated ectopic heterochromatin invasion by manipulating the fission yeast mating type locus boundary using a single-cell spreading reporter system. We found that heterochromatin repulsion is locally encoded by Set1/COMPASS on certain actively transcribed genes and that this protective role is most prominent at heterochromatin islands, small domains interspersed in euchromatin that regulate cell fate specifiers. Sensitivity to invasion by heterochromatin, surprisingly, is not dependent on Set1 altering overall gene expression levels. Rather, the gene-protective effect is strictly dependent on Set1's catalytic activity. H3K4 methylation, the Set1 product, antagonizes spreading in two ways: directly inhibiting catalysis by Suv39/Clr4 and locally disrupting nucleosome stability. Taken together, these results describe a mechanism for spatial encoding of euchromatic signals that repel heterochromatin invasion."	0
"32320653"	"The Autophagy-Initiating Kinase ULK1 Controls RIPK1-Mediated Cell Death.Autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis are stress responses governing the ultimate fate of a cell. However, the crosstalk between these cellular stress responses is not entirely understood. Especially, it is not clear whether the autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 and the cell-death-regulating kinase RIPK1 are involved in this potential crosstalk. Here, we identify RIPK1 as a substrate of ULK1. ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of RIPK1 reduces complex IIb/necrosome assembly and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death, whereas deprivation of ULK1 enhances TNF-induced cell death. We observe that ULK1 phosphorylates multiple sites of RIPK1, but it appears that especially phosphorylation of S357 within the intermediate domain of RIPK1 mediates this cell-death-inhibiting effect. We propose that ULK1 is a regulator of RIPK1-mediated cell death."	1
"32877684"	"Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cooperate to Suppress DNA- and RNA-Associated Molecular Pattern Recognition and Anti-Tumor Immune Responses.The DNA-dependent pattern recognition receptor, cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), mediates communication between the DNA damage and the immune responses. Mitotic chromosome missegregation stimulates cGAS activity; however, it is unclear whether progression through mitosis is required for cancercell-intrinsic activation of anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, it is unknown whether cell cycle checkpoint disruption can restore responses in cancer cells that are recalcitrant to DNAdamage-induced inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that prolonged cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>-mitosis boundary from either excessive DNA damage or CDK1 inhibition prevents inflammatory-stimulated gene expression and immune-mediated destruction of distal tumors. Remarkably, DNAdamage-induced inflammatory signaling is restored in a RIG-I-dependent manner upon concomitant disruption of p53 and the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint. These findings link aberrant cell progression and p53 loss to an expanded spectrum of damage-associated molecular pattern recognition and have implications for the design of rational approaches to augment anti-tumor immune responses."	0

Here, we observe a positive correlation between the percentages of CD32<sup>+</sup> cells among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of aviremic cART-treated, HIV-infected individuals and their HIV DNA loads in peripheral blood. Moreover, optimization of the CD32<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell purification protocol reveals prominent enrichment for HIV DNA (mean, 292-fold) in these cells.

"32049008"	"Prebiotic-Induced Anti-tumor Immunity Attenuates Tumor Growth.Growing evidence supports the importance of gut microbiota in the control of tumor growth and response to therapy. Here, we select prebiotics that can enrich bacterial taxa that promote anti-tumor immunity. Addition of the prebiotics inulin or mucin to the diet of C57BL/6 mice induces anti-tumor immune responses and inhibition of BRAF mutant melanoma growth in a subcutaneously implanted syngeneic mouse model. Mucin fails to inhibit tumor growth in germ-free mice, indicating that the gut microbiota is required for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response. Inulin and mucin drive distinct changes in the microbiota, as inulin, but not mucin, limits tumor growth in syngeneic mouse models of colon cancer and NRAS mutant melanoma and enhances the efficacy of a MEK inhibitor against melanoma while delaying the emergence of drug resistance. We highlight the importance of gut microbiota in anti-tumor immunity and the potential therapeutic role for prebiotics in this process."	0
"32768407"	"The 3D Topography of Mitotic Chromosomes.A long-standing conundrum is how mitotic chromosomes can compact, as required for clean separation to daughter cells, while maintaining close parallel alignment of sister chromatids. Pursuit of this question, by high resolution 3D fluorescence imaging of living and fixed mammalian cells, has led to three discoveries. First, we show that the structural axes of separated sister chromatids are linked by evenly spaced ""mini-axis"" bridges. Second, when chromosomes first emerge as discrete units, at prophase, they are organized as co-oriented sister linear loop arrays emanating from a conjoined axis. We show that this same basic organization persists throughout mitosis, without helical coiling. Third, from prophase onward, chromosomes are deformed into sequential arrays of half-helical segments of alternating handedness (perversions), accompanied by correlated kinks. These arrays fluctuate dynamically over <15 s timescales. Together these discoveries redefine the foundation for thinking about the evolution of mitotic chromosomes as they prepare for anaphase segregation."	0
"32527723"	"Structure and function of a flavin-dependent S-monooxygenase from garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>).Allicin is a component of the characteristic smell and flavor of garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>). A flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) produced by <i>A. sativum</i> (AsFMO) was previously proposed to oxidize <i>S</i>-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC) to alliin, an allicin precursor. Here, we present a kinetic and structural characterization of AsFMO that suggests a possible contradiction to this proposal. Results of steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that AsFMO exhibited negligible activity with SAC; however, the enzyme was highly active with l-cysteine, <i>N</i>-acetyl-l-cysteine, and allyl mercaptan. We found that allyl mercaptan with NADPH was the preferred substrate-cofactor combination. Rapid-reaction kinetic analyses showed that NADPH binds tightly (<i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of ∼2 μm) to AsFMO and that the hydride transfer occurs with pro-<i>R</i> stereospecificity. We detected the formation of a long-wavelength band when AsFMO was reduced by NADPH, probably representing the formation of a charge-transfer complex. In the absence of substrate, the reduced enzyme, in complex with NADP<sup>+</sup>, reacted with oxygen and formed an intermediate with a spectrum characteristic of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, which decays several orders of magnitude more slowly than the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> The presence of substrate enhanced C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formation and, upon hydroxylation, oxidation occurred with a rate constant similar to the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> The structure of AsFMO complexed with FAD at 2.08-Å resolution features two domains for binding of FAD and NADPH, representative of class B flavin monooxygenases. These biochemical and structural results are consistent with AsFMO being an S-monooxygenase involved in allicin biosynthesis through direct formation of sulfenic acid and not SAC oxidation."	0
"32579927"	"Drug GRADE: An Integrated Analysis of Population Growth and Cell Death Reveals Drug-Specific and Cancer Subtype-Specific Response Profiles.When evaluating anti-cancer drugs, two different measurements are used: relative viability, which scores an amalgam of proliferative arrest and cell death, and fractional viability, which specifically scores the degree of cell killing. We quantify relationships between drug-induced growth inhibition and cell death by counting live and dead cells using quantitative microscopy. We find that most drugs affect both proliferation and death, but in different proportions and with different relative timing. This causes a non-uniform relationship between relative and fractional response measurements. To unify these measurements, we created a data visualization and analysis platform called drug GRADE, which characterizes the degree to which death contributes to an observed drug response. GRADE captures drug- and genotype-specific responses, which are not captured using traditional pharmacometrics. This study highlights the idiosyncratic nature of drug-induced proliferative arrest and cell death. Furthermore, we provide a metric for quantitatively evaluating the relationship between these behaviors."	0
"32492422"	"Anandamide Metabolites Protect against Seizures through the TRP Channel Water Witch in Drosophila melanogaster.Endocannabinoids protect against seizures, but their mechanism of action is still unclear, as they can have effects independent of known cannabinoid receptors. Using Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks canonical cannabinoid receptors, we report that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol protect against seizures in multiple fly seizure models. Surprisingly, inhibition of anandamide catabolism renders flies insensitive to protection by anandamide, indicating that anandamide metabolites are responsible for seizure protection. Consistent with this finding, arachidonic acid, a direct metabolite of anandamide, protects against seizures. To identify downstream effectors, we test for a role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and find that the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine blocks the protective effect of anandamide. Also, a targeted genetic screen of TRP channels identifies water witch as a mediator of protection by anandamide. Using a Drosophila model, we reveal the role of arachidonic acid in seizure protection and identify a cannabinoid-receptor-1/2-independent mechanism of endocannabinoid seizure protection."	0

However, the molecular identity of the PLA<sub>2</sub> subtype(s) that supplies endogenous PUFAs for metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. Here we show that PLA2G2D, a secreted PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform, is constitutively expressed in M2-type macrophages in white adipose tissue (WAT) and shows a reciprocal correlation with obesity. Studies using global and macrophage-specific Pla2g2d-deficient mice reveal that PLA2G2D increases energy expenditure and thermogenesis by facilitating adipocyte browning, thereby ameliorating diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and WAT inflammation. Mechanistically, PLA2G2D constitutively supplies a pool of PUFAs, ω3 in particular, in WAT. Thus, our present findings underscore the contribution of the macrophage-driven PLA2G2D-ω3 PUFA axis to metabolic health."	0

Here, we investigate BIN1 function in the brain using conditional knockout (cKO) models. Loss of neuronal Bin1 expression results in the select impairment of spatial learning and memory. Examination of hippocampal CA1 excitatory synapses reveals a deficit in presynaptic release probability and slower depletion of neurotransmitters during repetitive stimulation, suggesting altered vesicle dynamics in Bin1 cKO mice. Super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy localizes BIN1 to presynaptic sites in excitatory synapses. Bin1 cKO significantly reduces synapse density and alters presynaptic active zone protein cluster formation. Finally, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction analysis uncovers a significant increase in docked and reserve pools of synaptic vesicles at hippocampal synapses in Bin1 cKO mice. Our results demonstrate a non-redundant role for BIN1 in presynaptic regulation, thus providing significant insights into the fundamental function of BIN1 in synaptic physiology relevant to Alzheimer disease."	0

Cardiolipin is a phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for the function of numerous mitochondrial proteins and processes. However, it is unclear how tafazzin deficiency impacts cardiac mitochondrial metabolism. To address this question while avoiding confounding effects of cardiomyopathy on mitochondrial phenotype, we utilized <i>Taz</i>-shRNA knockdown (<i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> ) mice, which exhibit defective cardiolipin remodeling and respiratory supercomplex instability characteristic of human Barth syndrome but normal cardiac function into adulthood. Consistent with previous reports from other models, mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission and oxidative damage were greater in <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> than in wild-type (WT) hearts, but there were no differences in oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency or membrane potential. Fatty acid and pyruvate oxidation capacities were 40-60% lower in <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> mitochondria, but an up-regulation of glutamate oxidation supported respiration rates approximating those with pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine in WT. Deficiencies in mitochondrial CoA and shifts in the cardiac acyl-CoA profile paralleled changes in fatty acid oxidation enzymes and acyl-CoA thioesterases, suggesting limitations of CoA availability or ""trapping"" in <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> mitochondrial metabolism. Incubation of <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> mitochondria with exogenous CoA partially rescued pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine oxidation capacities, implicating dysregulation of CoA-dependent intermediary metabolism rather than respiratory chain defects in the bioenergetic impacts of tafazzin deficiency. These findings support links among cardiolipin abnormalities, respiratory supercomplex instability, and mitochondrial oxidant production and shed new light on the distinct metabolic consequences of tafazzin deficiency in the mammalian heart."	0

Theoretical calculations suggest that the heat produced by RF fields is likely orders of magnitude weaker than needed for channel activation. Using the FeRIC (Ferritin iron Redistribution to Ion Channels) system, we have uncovered a mechanism of activation of ferritin-tagged channels via a biochemical pathway initiated by RF disturbance of ferritin and mediated by ferritin-associated iron. We show that, in cells expressing TRPV<sup>FeRIC</sup> channels, RF increases the levels of the labile iron pool in a ferritin-dependent manner. Free iron participates in chemical reactions, producing reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids that ultimately activate the TRPV<sup>FeRIC</sup> channels.

It is still unclear whether ANP controls cold-induced thermogenesis in vivo. Here, we show that acute cold exposure induces cardiac ANP secretion in mice and humans. Genetic inactivation of ANP promotes cold intolerance and suppresses half of cold-induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation in mice. While white adipocytes are resistant to ANP-mediated lipolysis at thermoneutral temperature in mice, cold exposure renders white adipocytes fully responsive to ANP to activate lipolysis and a thermogenic program, a physiological response that is dramatically suppressed in ANP null mice. ANP deficiency also blunts liver triglycerides and glycogen metabolism, thus impairing fuel availability for BAT thermogenesis. ANP directly increases mitochondrial uncoupling and thermogenic gene expression in human white and brown adipocytes. Together, these results indicate that ANP is a major physiological trigger of BAT thermogenesis upon cold exposure in mammals."	0

We found CTSS mutations at Y132 in 6% of FL (19/305). Another 13% (37/286) had CTSS amplification, which was associated with higher CTSS expression. CTSS Y132 mutations lead to accelerated autocatalytic conversion from an enzymatically inactive profrom to active CTSS and increased substrate cleavage, including CD74, which regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II)-restricted antigen presentation. Lymphoma cells with hyperactive CTSS more efficiently activated antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro.

Activated dynein complexes consist of one or two dynein dimers, the dynactin complex and an 'activating adaptor', and they show faster velocity when two dynein dimers are present<sup>3-6</sup>. Little is known about the assembly process of this massive ~4 MDa complex. Here, using purified recombinant human proteins, we uncover a role for the dynein-binding protein LIS1 in promoting the formation of activated dynein-dynactin complexes that contain two dynein dimers. Complexes activated by proteins representing three families of activating adaptors-BicD2, Hook3 and Ninl-all show enhanced motile properties in the presence of LIS1. Activated dynein complexes do not require sustained LIS1 binding for fast velocity. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that human LIS1 binds to dynein at two sites on the motor domain of dynein. Our research suggests that LIS1 binding at these sites functions in multiple stages of assembling the motile dynein-dynactin-activating adaptor complex."	0

DNase-seq footprinting enables the prediction of genome-wide binding sites for hundreds of TFs simultaneously. Despite the public availability of high-quality DNase-seq data from hundreds of samples, a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for the locations of genomic footprints is lacking. Here, we develop a scalable footprinting workflow using two state-of-the-art algorithms: Wellington and HINT. We apply our workflow to detect footprints in 192 ENCODE DNase-seq experiments and predict the genomic occupancy of 1,515 human TFs in 27 human tissues. We validate that these footprints overlap true-positive TF binding sites from ChIP-seq. We demonstrate that the locations, depth, and tissue specificity of footprints predict effects of genetic variants on gene expression and capture a substantial proportion of genetic risk for complex traits."	0
"32605922"	"<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> induces cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory NKG2D ligands on human monocytes.<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is among the leading causes of bacterial infections worldwide. The pathogenicity and establishment of <i>S. aureus</i> infections are tightly linked to its ability to modulate host immunity. Persistent infections are often associated with mutant staphylococcal strains that have decreased susceptibility to antibiotics; however, little is known about how these mutations influence bacterial interaction with the host immune system. Here, we discovered that clinical <i>S. aureus</i> isolates activate human monocytes, leading to cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands on the monocytes. We found that expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 (UL16-binding protein 2) is associated with bacterial degradability and phagolysosomal activity. Moreover, <i>S. aureus</i>-induced ULBP2 expression was linked to altered host cell metabolism, including increased cytoplasmic (iso)citrate levels, reduced glycolytic flux, and functional mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that the ability of <i>S. aureus</i> to induce ULBP2 and proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes depends on a functional ClpP protease in <i>S. aureus</i> These findings indicate that <i>S. aureus</i> activates ULBP2 in human monocytes through immunometabolic mechanisms and reveal that <i>clpP</i> inactivation may function as a potential immune evasion mechanism. Our results provide critical insight into the interplay between the host immune system and <i>S. aureus</i> that has evolved under the dual selective pressure of host immune responses and antibiotic treatment. Our discovery of an immune stimulatory pathway consisting of human monocyte-based defense against <i>S. aureus</i> suggests that targeting the NKG2D pathway holds potential for managing persistent staphylococcal infections."	0
"32905779"	"A Brainstem Locomotor Circuit Drives the Activity of Speed Cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex.Locomotion activates an array of sensory inputs that may help build the self-position map of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). In this map, speed-coding neurons are thought to dynamically update representations of the animal's position. A possible origin for the entorhinal speed signal is the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is critically involved in the activation of locomotor programs. Here, we describe, in rats, a circuit connecting the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) of the MLR to the MEC via the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB). At each level of this pathway, locomotion speed is linearly encoded in neuronal firing rates. Optogenetic activation of PPN cells drives locomotion and modulates activity of speed-modulated neurons in HDB and MEC. Our results provide evidence for a pathway by which brainstem speed signals can reach cortical structures implicated in navigation and higher-order dynamic representations of space."	0
"32610138"	"Structure of Human ATG9A, the Only Transmembrane Protein of the Core Autophagy Machinery.Autophagy is a catabolic process involving capture of cytoplasmic materials into double-membraned autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation of the materials by lysosomal hydrolases. One of the least understood components of the autophagy machinery is the transmembrane protein ATG9. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the function of ATG9A. In addition, structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes."	0

Here we apply this approach to the brain and successfully repair a guanosine-to-adenosine mutation in methyl CpG binding protein 2 RNA that causes the neurodevelopmental disease Rett syndrome. Repair is mediated by hippocampal injections of juvenile Mecp2<sup>317G>A</sup> mice with an adeno-associated virus expressing the hyperactive catalytic domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 and Mecp2 guide. After 1 month, 50% of Mecp2 RNA is recoded in three different hippocampal neuronal populations. MeCP2 protein localization to heterochromatin is restored in neurons to 50% of wild-type levels. Whole-transcriptome RNA analysis of one neuronal population indicates that the majority of off-target editing sites exhibit rates of 30% or less. This study demonstrates that programmable RNA editing can be utilized to repair mutations in mouse models of neurological disease."	0

"32001512"	"Recurrent SRSF2 mutations in MDS affect both splicing and NMD.Oncogenic mutations in the RNA splicing factors SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 are the most frequent class of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and are also common in clonal hematopoiesis, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a variety of solid tumors. They cause genome-wide splicing alterations that affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and NMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2 mutants enhance the deposition of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated molecular interactions. This architecture then favors the association of key NMD factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of EJC deposition by antisense oligonucleotides circumvents aberrant NMD promoted by mutant SRSF2, restoring the expression of PTC-containing transcript. Our study uncovered critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies, reflecting the regulation at multiple levels of RNA metabolism, from splicing to decay."	0
"31561952"	"Heat Shock Factor 1 Is a Direct Antagonist of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase.Through transcriptional control of the evolutionarily conserved heat shock, or proteotoxic stress, response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) preserves proteomic stability. Here, we show that HSF1, a physiological substrate for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), constitutively suppresses this central metabolic sensor. By physically evoking conformational switching of AMPK, HSF1 impairs AMP binding to the γ subunits and enhances the PP2A-mediated de-phosphorylation, but it impedes the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr172, and retards ATP binding to the catalytic α subunits. These immediate and manifold regulations empower HSF1 to both repress AMPK under basal conditions and restrain its activation by diverse stimuli, thereby promoting lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and protein cholesteroylation. In vivo, HSF1 antagonizes AMPK to control body fat mass and drive the lipogenic phenotype and growth of melanomas independently of its intrinsic transcriptional action. Thus, the physical AMPK-HSF1 interaction epitomizes a reciprocal kinase-substrate regulation whereby lipid metabolism and proteomic stability intertwine."	1
"31353208"	"Systematic Detection of Amino Acid Substitutions in Proteomes Reveals Mechanistic Basis of Ribosome Errors and Selection for Translation Fidelity.The translation machinery and the genes it decodes co-evolved to achieve production throughput and accuracy. Nonetheless, translation errors are frequent, and they affect physiology and protein evolution. Mapping translation errors in proteomes and understanding their causes is hindered by lack of a proteome-wide experimental methodology. We present the first methodology for systematic detection and quantification of errors in entire proteomes. Following proteome mass spectrometry, we identify, in E. coli and yeast, peptides whose mass indicates specific amino acid substitutions. Most substitutions result from codon-anticodon mispairing. Errors occur at sites that evolve rapidly and that minimally affect energetic stability, indicating selection for high translation fidelity. Ribosome density data show that errors occur at sites where ribosome velocity is higher, demonstrating a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Treating bacteria with an aminoglycoside antibiotic or deprivation of specific amino acids resulted in particular patterns of errors. These results reveal a mechanistic and evolutionary basis for translation fidelity."	0
"31995751"	"Vibrio cholerae-Symbiont Interactions Inhibit Intestinal Repair in Drosophila.Pathogen-mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium activates compensatory growth and differentiation repair programs in progenitor cells. Accelerated progenitor growth replenishes damaged tissue and maintains barrier integrity. Despite the importance of epithelial renewal to intestinal homeostasis, we know little about the effects of pathogen-commensal interactions on progenitor growth. We find that the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae blocks critical growth and differentiation pathways in Drosophila progenitors, despite extensive damage to epithelial tissue. We show that the inhibition of epithelial repair requires interactions between the Vibrio cholerae type six secretion system and a community of common symbiotic bacteria, as elimination of the gut microbiome is sufficient to restore homeostatic growth in infected intestines. This work highlights the importance of pathogen-symbiont interactions for intestinal immune responses and outlines the impact of the type six secretion system on pathogenesis."	0

"32049029"	"Blunted Vagal Cocaine- and Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript Promotes Hyperphagia and Weight Gain.The vagus nerve conveys gastrointestinal cues to the brain to control eating behavior. In obesity, vagally mediated gut-brain signaling is disrupted. Here, we show that the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a neuropeptide synthesized proportional to the food consumed in vagal afferent neurons (VANs) of chow-fed rats. CART injection into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), the site of vagal afferent central termination, reduces food intake. Conversely, blocking endogenous CART action in the NTS increases food intake in chow-fed rats, and this requires intact VANs. Viral-mediated Cartpt knockdown in VANs increases weight gain and daily food intake via larger meals and faster ingestion rate. In obese rats fed a high-fat, high-sugar diet, meal-induced CART synthesis in VANs is blunted and CART antibody fails to increase food intake. However, CART injection into the NTS retains its anorexigenic effect in obese rats. Restoring disrupted VAN CART signaling in obesity could be a promising therapeutic approach."	0
"32668253"	"Social Behavior Is Modulated by Valence-Encoding mPFC-Amygdala Sub-circuitry.The prefrontal cortex and amygdala are anatomical substrates linked to both social information and emotional valence processing, but it is not known whether sub-circuits in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that project to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are recruited and functionally contribute to social approach-avoidance behavior. Using retrograde labeling of mPFC projections to the BLA, we find that BLA-projecting neurons in the infralimbic cortex (IL) are preferentially activated in response to a social cue as compared with BLA-projecting neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL). Chemogenetic interrogation of these sub-circuits shows that activation of PL-BLA or inhibition of IL-BLA circuits impairs social behavior. Sustained closed-loop optogenetic activation of PL-BLA circuitry induces social impairment, corresponding to a negative emotional state as revealed by real-time place preference behavioral avoidance. Reactivation of foot shock-responsive PL-BLA circuitry impairs social behavior. Altogether, these data suggest a circuit-level mechanism by which valence-encoding mPFC-BLA sub-circuits shape social approach-avoidance behavior."	0

The stability of p53 depends on the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 but also on Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones that interact with its DNA binding domain (DBD). Using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry and biochemical methods, we analyzed conformational states of wild-type p53-DBD at physiological temperatures and conformational perturbations in three frequent p53 cancer mutants. We demonstrate that the Hsp70/Hdj1 system shifts the conformational equilibrium of p53 toward a flexible, more mutant-like, DNA binding inactive state by binding to the DNA binding loop. The analyzed cancer mutants are likewise destabilized by interaction with the Hsp70/Hdj1 system. In contrast, Hsp90 protects the DBD of p53 wild-type and mutant proteins from unfolding. We propose that the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone systems assume complementary functions to optimally balance conformational plasticity with conformational stability."	0
"31757757"	"Dynamic Imaging of RNA in Living Cells by CRISPR-Cas13 Systems.Visualizing the location and dynamics of RNAs in live cells is key to understanding their function.

Compared to the aptamer-based MS2-MCP strategy, an optimized dCas13 system is user friendly, does not require genetic manipulation, and achieves comparable RNA-labeling efficiency. We demonstrate that the dCas13 system is capable of labeling NEAT1, SatIII, MUC4, and GCN4 RNAs and allows the study of paraspeckle-associated NEAT1 dynamics. Applying orthogonal dCas13 proteins or combining dCas13 and MS2-MCP allows dual-color imaging of RNAs in single cells.

"31759823"	"A Conserved Noncoding Locus Regulates Random Monoallelic Xist Expression across a Topological Boundary.cis-Regulatory communication is crucial in mammalian development and is thought to be restricted by the spatial partitioning of the genome in topologically associating domains (TADs). Here, we discovered that the Xist locus is regulated by sequences in the neighboring TAD. In particular, the promoter of the noncoding RNA Linx (LinxP) acts as a long-range silencer and influences the choice of X chromosome to be inactivated. This is independent of Linx transcription and independent of any effect on Tsix, the antisense regulator of Xist that shares the same TAD as Linx. Unlike Tsix, LinxP is well conserved across mammals, suggesting an ancestral mechanism for random monoallelic Xist regulation. When introduced in the same TAD as Xist, LinxP switches from a silencer to an enhancer. Our study uncovers an unsuspected regulatory axis for X chromosome inactivation and a class of cis-regulatory effects that may exploit TAD partitioning to modulate developmental decisions."	0
"32616652"	"Garcinoic acid prevents β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in the mouse brain.Garcinoic acid (GA or δ-T3-13'COOH), is a natural vitamin E metabolite that has preliminarily been identified as a modulator of nuclear receptors involved in β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated GA's effects on Aβ oligomer formation and deposition. Specifically, we compared them with those of other vitamin E analogs and the soy isoflavone genistein, a natural agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) that has therapeutic potential for managing AD. GA significantly reduced Aβ aggregation and accumulation in mouse cortical astrocytes. Similarly to genistein, GA up-regulated PPARγ expression and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) efflux in these cells with an efficacy that was comparable with that of its metabolic precursor δ-tocotrienol and higher than those of α-tocopherol metabolites. Unlike for genistein and the other vitamin E compounds, the GA-induced restoration of ApoE efflux was not affected by pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ activity, and specific activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) was observed together with ApoE and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) membrane transporter up-regulation in both the mouse astrocytes and brain tissue. These effects of GA were associated with reduced Aβ deposition in the brain of TgCRND8 mice, a transgenic AD model. In conclusion, GA holds potential for preventing Aβ oligomerization and deposition in the brain. The mechanistic aspects of GA's properties appear to be distinct from those of other vitamin E metabolites and of genistein."	0
"31896687"	"Top1 and Top2 promote replication fork arrest at a programmed pause site.Programmed fork pausing is a complex process allowing cells to arrest replication forks at specific loci in a polar manner. Studies in budding yeast and other model organisms indicate that such replication fork barriers do not act as roadblocks passively impeding fork progression but rather elicit complex interactions between fork and barrier components. In this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Shyian and colleagues (pp. 87-98) show that in budding yeast, the fork protection complex Tof1-Csm3 interacts physically with DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) at replication forks through the C-terminal domain of Tof1. Fork pausing at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) replication fork barrier (RFB) is impaired in the absence of Top1 or in a <i>tof1</i> mutant that does not bind Top1, but the function of Top1 can be partially compensated for by Top2. Together, these data indicate that topoisomerases play an unexpected role in the regulation of programmed fork pausing in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>."	0

Here, we show that mice with an equivalent genetic mutation (16p11.2 duplication mice) exhibit impaired hippocampal-orbitofrontal and hippocampal-amygdala functional connectivity. Expression of schizophrenia-relevant GABAergic cell markers (parvalbumin and calbindin) is selectively decreased in orbitofrontal cortex, while somatostatin expression is decreased in lateral amygdala. When 16p11.2 duplication mice are tested in cognitive tasks dependent on hippocampal-orbitofrontal connectivity, performance is impaired in an 8-arm maze ""N-back"" working memory task and in a touchscreen continuous performance task. Consistent with hippocampal-amygdala dysconnectivity, deficits in ethologically relevant social behaviors are also observed. Overall, the cellular/molecular, brain network, and behavioral alterations markedly mirror those observed in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, the data suggest that 16p11.2 duplications selectively impact hippocampal-amygdaloid-orbitofrontal circuitry, supporting emerging ideas that dysfunction in this network is a core element of schizophrenia and defining a neural circuit endophenotype for the disease."	0

However, the intra- and extrahippocampal pathways that route contextual information to cortical and subcortical circuits to guide adaptive behavioral responses are poorly understood. Using terminal-specific optogenetic silencing in a contextual fear discrimination learning paradigm, we identify opposing roles for dorsal CA3-CA1 (dCA3-dCA1) projections and dorsal CA3-dorsolateral septum (dCA3-DLS) projections in calibrating fear responses to certain and ambiguous contextual threats, respectively. Ventral CA3-DLS (vCA3-DLS) projections suppress fear responses in both certain and ambiguous contexts, whereas ventral CA3-CA1 (vCA3-vCA1) projections promote fear responses in both these contexts. Lastly, using retrograde monosynaptic tracing, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, and optogenetics, we identify a sparse population of DLS parvalbumin (PV) neurons as putative relays of dCA3-DLS projections to diverse subcortical circuits.

"32521226"	"The Nuclear SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Quality Control Network Regulates the Dynamics of Cytoplasmic Stress Granules.Exposure of cells to heat or oxidative stress causes misfolding of proteins. To avoid toxic protein aggregation, cells have evolved nuclear and cytosolic protein quality control (PQC) systems. In response to proteotoxic stress, cells also limit protein synthesis by triggering transient storage of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cytosolic stress granules (SGs). We demonstrate that the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (StUbL) pathway, which is part of the nuclear proteostasis network, regulates SG dynamics. We provide evidence that inactivation of SUMO deconjugases under proteotoxic stress initiates SUMO-primed, RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation of RBPs that typically condense into SGs. Impairment of SUMO-primed ubiquitylation drastically delays SG resolution upon stress release. Importantly, the StUbL system regulates compartmentalization of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated FUS mutant in SGs. We propose that the StUbL system functions as surveillance pathway for aggregation-prone RBPs in the nucleus, thereby linking the nuclear and cytosolic axis of proteotoxic stress response."	0

"32755579"	"The Ubiquitin Ligase TRIP12 Limits PARP1 Trapping and Constrains PARP Inhibitor Efficiency.PARP inhibitors (PARPi) cause synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance."	0

Telomerase RNA and related noncoding RNAs require 3' end-processing steps, including oligoadenylation. Germline mutations in poly(A)ribonuclease (PARN) cause accumulation of extended human telomerase RNA (hTR) species and precipitate dyskeratosis congenita and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we develop nascent RNAend-seq to measure processing rates of RNA precursors. We find that mature hTR derives from extended precursors but that in PARN-mutant cells hTR maturation kinetically stalls and unprocessed precursors are degraded. Loss of poly(A)polymerase PAPD5 in PARN-mutant cells accelerates hTR maturation and restores hTR processing, indicating that oligoadenylation and deadenylation set rates of hTR maturation. The H/ACA domain mediates hTR maturation by precisely defining the 3' end, recruiting poly(A)polymerase activity, and conferring sensitivity to PARN regulation. These data reveal a feedforward circuit in which post-transcriptional oligoadenylation controls RNA maturation kinetics. Similar alterations in RNA processing rates may contribute to mechanisms of RNA-based human disease."	0

Surprisingly, intron-targeted ASOs reduce the level of pre-mRNA associated with chromatin to a greater extent than exon-targeted ASOs. This indicates that exon-targeted ASOs achieve full activity after the pre-mRNA has undergone splicing, but before the mRNA is released from chromatin. Even though RNase H ASOs can reduce the level of RNA associated with chromatin, the effect of ASO-directed RNA degradation on transcription has never been documented. Here we show that intron-targeted ASOs and, to a lesser extent, exon-targeted ASOs cause RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination in cultured cells and mice.

We find that the deletion of Ebf2 in adipocytes of mice ablates BAT character and function, resulting in cold intolerance. Unexpectedly, prolonged exposure to cold restores the thermogenic profile and function of Ebf2 mutant BAT. Enhancer profiling and genetic assays identified EBF1 as a candidate regulator of the cold response in BAT. Adipocyte-specific deletion of both Ebf1 and Ebf2 abolishes BAT recruitment during chronic cold exposure. Mechanistically, EBF1 and EBF2 promote thermogenic gene transcription through increasing the expression and activity of ERRα and PGC1α. Together, these studies demonstrate that EBF proteins specify the developmental fate and control the adaptive cold response of brown adipocytes."	0
"30661982"	"Light Regulates Plant Alternative Splicing through the Control of Transcriptional Elongation.Light makes carbon fixation possible, allowing plant and animal life on Earth. We have previously shown that light regulates alternative splicing in plants. Light initiates a chloroplast retrograde signaling that regulates nuclear alternative splicing of a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana transcripts. Here, we show that light promotes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation in the affected genes, whereas in darkness, elongation is lower. These changes in transcription are consistent with elongation causing the observed changes in alternative splicing, as revealed by different drug treatments and genetic evidence. The light control of splicing and elongation is abolished in an Arabidopsis mutant defective in the transcription factor IIS (TFIIS). We report that the chloroplast control of nuclear alternative splicing in plants responds to the kinetic coupling mechanism found in mammalian cells, providing unique evidence that coupling is important for a whole organism to respond to environmental cues."	0
"32783931"	"Differential Histone Distribution Patterns in Induced Asymmetrically Dividing Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.Wnt3a-coated beads can induce asymmetric divisions of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), resulting in one self-renewed mESC and one differentiating epiblast stem cell. This provides an opportunity for studying histone inheritance pattern at a single-cell resolution in cell culture. Here, we report that mESCs with Wnt3a-bead induction display nonoverlapping preexisting (old) versus newly synthesized (new) histone H3 patterns, but mESCs without Wnt3a beads have largely overlapping patterns. Furthermore, H4K20me2/3, an old histone-enriched modification, displays a higher instance of asymmetric distribution on chromatin fibers from Wnt3a-induced mESCs than those from non-induced mESCs. These locally distinct distributions between old and new histones have both cellular specificity in Wnt3a-induced mESCs and molecular specificity for histones H3 and H4. Given that post-translational modifications at H3 and H4 carry the major histone modifications, our findings provide a mammalian cell culture system to study histone inheritance for maintaining stem cell fate and for resetting it during differentiation."	0

Epa family members are lectins with binding pockets containing several conserved and variable structural hot spots, which were implicated in mediating functional diversity. In this study, we have performed an elaborate structure-based mutational analysis of numerous Epa paralogs to generally determine the role of diverse structural hot spots in conferring host cell binding and ligand binding specificity. Our study reveals that several conserved structural motifs contribute to efficient host cell binding. Moreover, our directed motif exchange experiments reveal that the variable loop CBL2 is key for programming ligand binding specificity, albeit with limited predictability. In contrast, we find that the variable loop L1 affects host cell binding without significantly influencing the specificity of ligand binding. Our data strongly suggest that variation of numerous structural hot spots in the ligand binding pocket of Epa proteins is a main driver of their functional diversification and evolution."	0
"32665399"	"Glycan analysis of human neutrophil granules implicates a maturation-dependent glycosylation machinery.Protein glycosylation is essential to trafficking and immune functions of human neutrophils. During granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, distinct neutrophil granules are successively formed. Distinct receptors and effector proteins, many of which are glycosylated, are targeted to each type of granule according to their time of expression, a process called ""targeting by timing."" Therefore, these granules are time capsules reflecting different times of maturation that can be used to understand the glycosylation process during granulopoiesis. Herein, neutrophil subcellular granules were fractionated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and <i>N</i>- and <i>O</i>-glycans present in each compartment were analyzed by LC-MS. We found abundant paucimannosidic <i>N</i>-glycans and lack of <i>O</i>-glycans in the early-formed azurophil granules, whereas the later-formed specific and gelatinase granules and secretory vesicles contained complex <i>N-</i> and <i>O-</i>glycans with remarkably elongated <i>N</i>-acetyllactosamine repeats with Lewis epitopes. Immunoblotting and histochemical analysis confirmed the expression of Lewis X and sialyl-Lewis X in the intracellular granules and on the cell surface, respectively. Many glycans identified are unique to neutrophils, and their complexity increased progressively from azurophil granules to specific granules and then to gelatinase granules, suggesting temporal changes in the glycosylation machinery indicative of ""glycosylation by timing"" during granulopoiesis. In summary, this comprehensive neutrophil granule glycome map, the first of its kind, highlights novel granule-specific glycosylation features and is a crucial first step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating protein glycosylation during neutrophil granulopoiesis and a more detailed understanding of neutrophil biology and function."	0

NuA4/TIP60 inhibits 53BP1 binding to chromatin through recognition of the H4K20me mark by MBTD1 and acetylation of H2AK15, blocking the ubiquitination mark required for 53BP1 localization at DNA breaks. The NuA4/TIP60 non-catalytic subunit EPC1 enlists MBTD1 into the complex, but the detailed molecular mechanism remains incompletely explored. Here, we present the crystal structure of the MBTD1-EPC1 complex, revealing a hydrophobic C-terminal fragment of EPC1 engaging the MBT repeats of MBTD1 in a site distinct from the H4K20me binding site. Different cellular assays validate the physiological significance of the key residues involved in the MBTD1-EPC1 interaction. Our study provides a structural framework for understanding the mechanism by which MBTD1 recruits the NuA4/TIP60 acetyltransferase complex to influence transcription and DNA repair pathway choice."	0

A remarkably similar intronic TG<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeat expansion is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36). Both expansions are widely expressed, form RNA foci, and can undergo repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation to form similar dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Yet, these diseases result in the degeneration of distinct subsets of neurons. We show that the expression of these repeat expansions in mice is sufficient to recapitulate the unique features of each disease, including this selective neuronal vulnerability. Furthermore, only the G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeat induces the formation of aberrant stress granules and pTDP-43 inclusions. Overall, our results demonstrate that the pathomechanisms responsible for each disease are intrinsic to the individual repeat sequence, highlighting the importance of sequence-specific RNA-mediated toxicity in each disorder."	0
"30449725"	"A B-Cell-Specific Enhancer Orchestrates Nuclear Architecture to Generate a Diverse Antigen Receptor Repertoire.The genome is organized into topologically associated domains (TADs) that enclose smaller subTADs. Here, we identify and characterize an enhancer that is located in the middle of the V gene region of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain (Igκ) locus that becomes active preceding the stage at which this locus undergoes V(D)J recombination. This enhancer is a hub of long-range chromatin interactions connecting subTADs in the V gene region with the recombination center at the J genes. Deletion of this element results in a highly altered long-range chromatin interaction pattern across the locus and, importantly, affects individual V gene utilization locus-wide. These results indicate the existence of an enhancer-dependent framework in the Igκ locus and further suggest that the composition of the diverse antibody repertoire is regulated in a subTAD-specific manner. This enhancer thus plays a structural role in orchestrating the proper folding of the Igκ locus in preparation for V(D)J recombination."	0

Although developmental transcription factors such as active forms of Notch can directly stimulate transcription by activating enhancers, the effect of their oncogenic subversion on the 3D organization of cancer genomes is largely undetermined. By mapping chromatin looping genome-wide in Notch-dependent triple-negative breast cancer and B cell lymphoma, we show that beyond the well-characterized role of Notch as an activator of distal enhancers, Notch regulates its direct target genes by instructing enhancer repositioning. Moreover, a large fraction of Notch-instructed regulatory loops form highly interacting enhancer and promoter spatial clusters termed ""3D cliques."" Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that Notch preferentially targets hyperconnected 3D cliques that regulate the expression of crucial proto-oncogenes. Our observations suggest that oncogenic hijacking of developmental transcription factors can dysregulate transcription through widespread effects on the spatial organization of cancer genomes."	0
"32348762"	"Ensemble-Level Organization of Human Kinetochores and Evidence for Distinct Tension and Attachment Sensors.Kinetochores are multi-protein machines that form dynamic attachments to microtubules and control chromosome segregation. High fidelity is ensured because kinetochores can monitor attachment status and tension, using this information to activate checkpoints and error-correction mechanisms. To explore how kinetochores achieve this, we used two- and three-color subpixel fluorescence localization to define how proteins from six major complexes (CCAN, MIS12, NDC80, KNL1, RZZ, and SKA) and the checkpoint proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad2 are organized in the human kinetochore. This reveals how the outer kinetochore has a high nematic order and is largely invariant to the loss of attachment or tension, except for two mechanical sensors. First, Knl1 unravels to relay tension, and second, NDC80 undergoes jackknifing and loss of nematic order under microtubule detachment, with only the latter wired up to the checkpoint signaling system. This provides insight into how kinetochores integrate mechanical signals to promote error-free chromosome segregation."	0
"32516598"	"Endogenous DNA 3' Blocks Are Vulnerabilities for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Deficiency and Are Reversed by the APE2 Nuclease.The APEX2 gene encodes APE2, a nuclease related to APE1, the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease acting in base excision repair. Loss of APE2 is lethal in cells with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, making APE2 a prime target for homologous recombination-defective cancers. However, because the function of APE2 in DNA repair is poorly understood, it is unclear why BRCA-deficient cells require APE2 for viability. Here we present the genetic interaction profiles of APE2, APE1, and TDP1 deficiency coupled to biochemical and structural dissection of APE2. We conclude that the main role of APE2 is to reverse blocked 3' DNA ends, problematic lesions that preclude DNA synthesis. Our work also suggests that TOP1 processing of genomic ribonucleotides is the main source of 3'-blocking lesions relevant to APEX2-BRCA1/2 synthetic lethality. The exquisite sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to 3' blocks indicates that they represent a tractable vulnerability in homologous recombination-deficient tumor cells."	0
"30770239"	"The RNase PARN Controls the Levels of Specific miRNAs that Contribute to p53 Regulation.PARN loss-of-function mutations cause a severe form of the hereditary disease dyskeratosis congenita (DC). PARN deficiency affects the stability of non-coding RNAs such as human telomerase RNA (hTR), but these effects do not explain the severe disease in patients. We demonstrate that PARN deficiency affects the levels of numerous miRNAs in human cells. PARN regulates miRNA levels by stabilizing either mature or precursor miRNAs by removing oligo(A) tails added by the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5, which if remaining recruit the exonuclease DIS3L or DIS3L2 to degrade the miRNA. PARN knockdown destabilizes multiple miRNAs that repress p53 translation, which leads to an increase in p53 accumulation in a Dicer-dependent manner, thus explaining why PARN-defective patients show p53 accumulation. This work also reveals that DIS3L and DIS3L2 are critical 3' to 5' exonucleases that regulate miRNA stability, with the addition and removal of 3' end extensions controlling miRNA levels in the cell."	0

"32636300"	"Cardiolipin-deficient cells have decreased levels of the iron-sulfur biogenesis protein frataxin.Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, where it is synthesized locally and plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Previous studies in the yeast model have indicated that CL is required for optimal iron homeostasis, which is disrupted by a mechanism not yet determined in the yeast CL mutant, <i>crd1</i>Δ. This finding has implications for the severe genetic disorder, Barth syndrome (BTHS), in which CL metabolism is perturbed because of mutations in the CL-remodeling enzyme, tafazzin. Here, we investigate the effects of tafazzin deficiency on iron homeostasis in the mouse myoblast model of BTHS tafazzin knockout (TAZ-KO) cells. Similarly to CL-deficient yeast cells, TAZ-KO cells exhibited elevated sensitivity to iron, as well as to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which was alleviated by the iron chelator deferoxamine. TAZ-KO cells exhibited increased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin and decreased expression of the iron importer transferrin receptor, likely reflecting a regulatory response to elevated mitochondrial iron. Reduced activities of mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster enzymes suggested that the mechanism underlying perturbation of iron homeostasis was defective iron-sulfur biogenesis. We observed decreased levels of Yfh1/frataxin, an essential component of the iron-sulfur biogenesis machinery, in mitochondria from TAZ-KO mouse cells and in CL-deleted yeast <i>crd1</i>Δ cells, indicating that the role of CL in iron-sulfur biogenesis is highly conserved. Yeast <i>crd1</i>Δ cells exhibited decreased processing of the Yfh1 precursor upon import, which likely contributes to the iron homeostasis defects. Implications for understanding the pathogenesis of BTHS are discussed."	0
"32553192"	"Intrinsically Disordered Regions Direct Transcription Factor In Vivo Binding Specificity.Transcription factors (TFs) that bind common DNA motifs in vitro occupy distinct sets of promoters in vivo, raising the question of how binding specificity is achieved. TFs are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions commonly form promiscuous interactions, yet their unique properties might also benefit specific binding-site selection. We examine this using Msn2 and Yap1, TFs of distinct families that contain long IDRs outside their DNA-binding domains. We find that these IDRs are both necessary and sufficient for localizing to the majority of target promoters. This IDR-directed binding does not depend on any localized domain but results from a multitude of weak determinants distributed throughout the entire IDR sequence. Furthermore, IDR specificity is conserved between distant orthologs, suggesting direct interaction with multiple promoters. We propose that distribution of sensing determinants along extended IDRs accelerates binding-site detection by rapidly localizing TFs to broad DNA regions surrounding these sites."	0

Here, we show that the Foxa protein family members and Hnf4α sequentially and cooperatively bind to chromatin to activate liver-specific gene expression. Although all Foxa proteins bind to and open regions of closed chromatin as pioneer factors, Foxa3 has the unique potential of transferring from the distal to proximal regions of the transcription start site of target genes, binding RNA polymerase II, and co-traversing target genes. These distinctive characteristics of Foxa3 are essential for inducing the hepatic fate in fibroblasts. Similar functional coupling of transcription factors to RNA polymerase II may occur in other contexts whereby transcriptional activation can induce cell differentiation."	0

However, the functional similarities and differences among these proteins are largely unknown. In the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, UNC-87 is a calponin-related protein with seven calponin-like (CLIK) motifs and is required for maintenance of contractile apparatuses in muscle cells. Here, we report that CLIK-1, another calponin-related protein that also contains seven CLIK motifs, functionally overlaps with UNC-87 in maintaining actin cytoskeletal integrity <i>in vivo</i> and has both common and different actin-regulatory activities <i>in vitro</i> We found that CLIK-1 is predominantly expressed in the body wall muscle and somatic gonad in which UNC-87 is also expressed. <i>unc-87</i> mutation caused cytoskeletal defects in the body wall muscle and somatic gonad, whereas <i>clik-1</i> depletion alone caused no detectable phenotypes. However, simultaneous <i>clik-1</i> and <i>unc-87</i> depletion caused sterility because of ovulation failure by severely affecting the contractile actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath of the somatic gonad. <i>In vitro</i>, UNC-87 bundled actin filaments, whereas CLIK-1 bound to actin filaments without bundling them and antagonized UNC-87-mediated filament bundling. We noticed that UNC-87 and CLIK-1 share common functions that inhibit cofilin binding and allow tropomyosin binding to actin filaments, suggesting that both proteins stabilize actin filaments. In conclusion, partially redundant functions of UNC-87 and CLIK-1 in ovulation are likely mediated by their common actin-regulatory activities, but their distinct actin-bundling activities suggest that they also have different biological functions."	0
"31047794"	"Cross-Regulation between TDP-43 and Paraspeckles Promotes Pluripotency-Differentiation Transition.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression, but their joint functions in coordinating cell fate decisions are poorly understood. Here we show that the expression and activity of the RBP TDP-43 and the long isoform of the lncRNA Neat1, the scaffold of the nuclear compartment ""paraspeckles,"" are reciprocal in pluripotent and differentiated cells because of their cross-regulation. In pluripotent cells, TDP-43 represses the formation of paraspeckles by enhancing the polyadenylated short isoform of Neat1. TDP-43 also promotes pluripotency by regulating alternative polyadenylation of transcripts encoding pluripotency factors, including Sox2, which partially protects its 3' UTR from miR-21-mediated degradation. Conversely, paraspeckles sequester TDP-43 and other RBPs from mRNAs and promote exit from pluripotency and embryonic patterning in the mouse. We demonstrate that cross-regulation between TDP-43 and Neat1 is essential for their efficient regulation of a broad network of genes and, therefore, of pluripotency and differentiation."	0

"30819645"	"The mRNA Export Receptor NXF1 Coordinates Transcriptional Dynamics, Alternative Polyadenylation, and mRNA Export.Alternative polyadenylation (APA) produces mRNA isoforms with different 3' UTR lengths. Previous studies indicated that 3' end processing and mRNA export are intertwined in gene regulation. Here, we show that mRNA export factors generally facilitate usage of distal cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs), leading to long 3' UTR isoform expression. By focusing on the export receptor NXF1, which exhibits the most potent effect on APA in this study, we reveal several gene features that impact NXF1-dependent APA, including 3' UTR size, gene size, and AT content. Surprisingly, NXF1 downregulation results in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) accumulation at the 3' end of genes, correlating with its role in APA regulation. Moreover, NXF1 cooperates with CFI-68 to facilitate nuclear export of long 3' UTR isoform with UGUA motifs. Together, our work reveals important roles of NXF1 in coordinating transcriptional dynamics, 3' end processing, and nuclear export of long 3' UTR transcripts, implicating NXF1 as a nexus of gene regulation."	0
"30772176"	"Demethylation of the Protein Phosphatase PP2A Promotes Demethylation of Histones to Enable Their Function as a Methyl Group Sink.Dysregulation of chromatin methylation is associated with defects in cellular differentiation as well as a variety of cancers. How cells regulate the opposing activities of histone methyltransferase and demethylase enzymes to set the methylation status of the epigenome for proper control of gene expression and metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of methylation of the major phosphatase PP2A in response to methionine starvation activates the demethylation of histones through hyperphosphorylation of specific demethylase enzymes. In parallel, this regulatory mechanism enables cells to preserve SAM by increasing SAH to limit SAM consumption by methyltransferase enzymes. Mutants lacking the PP2A methyltransferase or the effector H3K36 demethylase Rph1 exhibit elevated SAM levels and are dependent on cysteine due to reduced capacity to sink the methyl groups of SAM. Therefore, PP2A directs the methylation status of histones by regulating the phosphorylation status of histone demethylase enzymes in response to SAM levels."	0
"32554805"	"Protein docking and steered molecular dynamics suggest alternative phospholamban-binding sites on the SERCA calcium transporter.The transport activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) in cardiac myocytes is modulated by an inhibitory interaction with a transmembrane peptide, phospholamban (PLB). Previous biochemical studies have revealed that PLB interacts with a specific inhibitory site on SERCA, and low-resolution structural evidence suggests that PLB interacts with distinct alternative sites on SERCA. High-resolution details of the structural determinants of SERCA regulation have been elusive because of the dynamic nature of the regulatory complex. In this study, we used computational approaches to develop a structural model of SERCA-PLB interactions to gain a mechanistic understanding of PLB-mediated SERCA transport regulation. We combined steered molecular dynamics and membrane protein-protein docking experiments to achieve both a global search and all-atom force calculations to determine the relative affinities of PLB for candidate sites on SERCA. We modeled the binding of PLB to several SERCA conformations, representing different enzymatic states sampled during the calcium transport catalytic cycle. The results of the steered molecular dynamics and docking experiments indicated that the canonical PLB-binding site (comprising transmembrane helices M2, M4, and M9) is the preferred site. This preference was even more stringent for a superinhibitory PLB variant. Interestingly, PLB-binding specificity became more ambivalent for other SERCA conformers. These results provide evidence for polymorphic PLB interactions with novel sites on M3 and with the outside of the SERCA helix M9. Our findings are compatible with previous physical measurements that suggest that PLB interacts with multiple binding sites, conferring dynamic responsiveness to changing physiological conditions."	0

Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans."	1

It is unclear how these two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors mediate such fundamentally different outcomes. The chromatin binding of Ascl1 and Myod1 was surprisingly similar in fibroblasts, yet their transcriptional outputs were drastically different. We found that quantitative binding differences explained differential chromatin remodelling and gene activation. Although strong Ascl1 binding was exclusively associated with bHLH motifs, strong Myod1-binding sites were co-enriched with non-bHLH motifs, possibly explaining why Ascl1 is less context dependent. Finally, we observed that promiscuous binding of Myod1 to neuronal targets results in neuronal reprogramming when the muscle program is inhibited by Myt1l. Our findings suggest that chromatin access of on-target pioneer factors is primarily driven by the protein-DNA interaction, unlike ordinary context-dependent transcription factors, and that promiscuous transcription factor binding requires specific silencing mechanisms to ensure lineage fidelity."	0

Here, we show that DDI2 knockout cells are sensitive to proteasome inhibition and accumulate high-molecular weight, ubiquitylated proteins that are poorly degraded by the proteasome. These proteins are targets for the protease activity of purified DDI2. No evidence for DDI2 acting as a de-ubiquitylating enzyme was uncovered, which could suggest that it cleaves the ubiquitylated protein itself. In support of this idea, cleavage of transcription factor NRF1 is known to require DDI2 activity in vivo. We show that DDI2 is indeed capable of cleaving NRF1 in vitro but only when NRF1 protein is highly poly-ubiquitylated. Together, these data suggest that DDI2 is a ubiquitin-directed endoprotease."	0

Using genetics, cell biology, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that Neto-α functions on both sides of the NMJ. In muscle, Neto-α limits the size of the postsynaptic receptor field. In motor neurons (MNs), Neto-α controls neurotransmitter release in a KAR-dependent manner. In addition, Neto-α is both required and sufficient for the presynaptic increase in neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic sensitivity.

"31175012"	"Engineered Ribonucleoprotein Granules Inhibit Translation in Protocells.Liquid granules rich in intrinsically disordered proteins and RNA play key roles in critical cellular functions such as RNA processing and translation. Many details of the mechanism via which this occurs remain to be elucidated. Motivated by the lacuna in the field and by the prospects of developing de novo artificial granules that provide extrinsic control of translation, we report a bottom-up approach to engineer ribonucleoprotein granules composed of a recombinant RNA-binding IDP that exhibits phase behavior in water. We developed a kinetic model to illustrate that these granules inhibit translation through reversible or irreversible sequestration of mRNA. Within monodisperse droplets capable of transcription and translation, we experimentally demonstrate temporal inhibition of translation by using designer IDPs that exhibit tunable phase behavior. This work lays the foundation for developing artificial granules that promise to further our mechanistic understanding of their naturally occurring counterparts."	0
"32905778"	"A WW Tandem-Mediated Dimerization Mode of SAV1 Essential for Hippo Signaling.The canonical mammalian Hippo pathway contains a core kinase signaling cascade requiring upstream MST to form a stable complex with SAV1 in order to phosphorylate the downstream LATS/MOB complex. Though SAV1 dimerization is essential for the trans-activation of MST, the molecular mechanism underlying SAV1 dimerization is unclear. Here, we discover that the SAV1 WW tandem containing a short Pro-rich extension immediately following the WW tandem (termed as ""WW12ex"") forms a highly stable homodimer. The crystal structure of SAV1 WW12ex reveals that the Pro-rich extension of one subunit binds to both WW domains from the other subunit. Thus, SAV1 WW12ex forms a domain-swapped dimer instead of a WW2 homodimerization-mediated dimer. The WW12ex-mediated dimerization of SAV1 is required for the MST/SAV1 complex assembly and MST kinase activation. Finally, we show that several cancer-related SAV1 variants disrupt SAV1 dimer formation, and thus, these mutations may impair the tumor-suppression activity of SAV1."	0
"32437639"	"ATP Hydrolysis by the SNF2 Domain of Dnmt5 Is Coupled to Both Specific Recognition and Modification of Hemimethylated DNA.C.neoformans Dnmt5 is an unusually specific maintenance-type CpG methyltransferase (DNMT) that mediates long-term epigenome evolution. It harbors a DNMT domain and SNF2 ATPase domain. We find that the SNF2 domain couples substrate specificity to an ATPase step essential for DNA methylation. Coupling occurs independent of nucleosomes. Hemimethylated DNA preferentially stimulates ATPase activity, and mutating Dnmt5's ATP-binding pocket disproportionately reduces ATPase stimulation by hemimethylated versus unmethylated substrates. Engineered DNA substrates that stabilize a reaction intermediate by mimicking a ""flipped-out"" conformation of the target cytosine bypass the SNF2 domain's requirement for hemimethylation. This result implies that ATP hydrolysis by the SNF2 domain is coupled to the DNMT domain conformational changes induced by preferred substrates. These findings establish a new role for a SNF2 ATPase: controlling an adjoined enzymatic domain's substrate recognition and catalysis. We speculate that this coupling contributes to the exquisite specificity of Dnmt5 via mechanisms related to kinetic proofreading."	0
"31351877"	"Activation of PARP-1 by snoRNAs Controls Ribosome Biogenesis and Cell Growth via the RNA Helicase DDX21.PARP inhibitors (PARPi) prevent cancer cell growth by inducing synthetic lethality with DNA repair defects (e.g., in BRCA1/2 mutant cells). We have identified an alternative pathway for PARPi-mediated growth control in BRCA1/2-intact breast cancer cells involving rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. PARP-1 binds to snoRNAs, which stimulate PARP-1 catalytic activity in the nucleolus independent of DNA damage. Activated PARP-1 ADP-ribosylates DDX21, an RNA helicase that localizes to nucleoli and promotes rDNA transcription when ADP-ribosylated. Treatment with PARPi or mutation of the ADP-ribosylation sites reduces DDX21 nucleolar localization, rDNA transcription, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, and cell growth. The salient features of this pathway are evident in xenografts in mice and human breast cancer patient samples. Elevated levels of PARP-1 and nucleolar DDX21 are associated with cancer-related outcomes. Our studies provide a mechanistic rationale for efficacy of PARPi in cancer cells lacking defects in DNA repair whose growth is inhibited by PARPi."	0

SghA is a newly identified virulence factor enzymatically releasing salicylic acid from its glucoside conjugate and controlling plant tumor development. Here, we report the structural basis of SghR, a LacI-type transcription factor highly conserved in <i>Rhizobiaceae</i> family, regulating the expression of SghA and involved in tumorigenesis. We identified and characterized the binding site of SghR on the promoter region of <i>sghA</i> and then determined the crystal structures of apo-SghR, SghR complexed with its operator DNA, and ligand sucrose, respectively. These results provide detailed insights into how SghR recognizes its cognate DNA and shed a mechanistic light on how sucrose attenuates the affinity of SghR with DNA to modulate the expression of SghA. Given the important role of SghR in mediating the signaling cross-talk during <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection, our results pave the way for structure-based inducer analog design, which has potential applications for agricultural industry."	0
"30503771"	"Iruka Eliminates Dysfunctional Argonaute by Selective Ubiquitination of Its Empty State.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are loaded into the Argonaute subfamily of proteins (AGO) to form an effector complex that silences target genes. Empty but not miRNA-loaded AGO is selectively degraded across species. However, the mechanism and biological significance of selective AGO degradation remain unclear. We discovered a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase we named Iruka (Iru), which selectively ubiquitinates the empty form of Drosophila Ago1 to trigger its degradation. Iru preferentially binds empty Ago1 and ubiquitinates Lys514 in the L2 linker, which is predicted to be inaccessible in the miRNA-loaded state. Depletion of Iru results in global impairment of miRNA-mediated silencing of target genes and in the accumulation of aberrant Ago1 that is dysfunctional for canonical protein-protein interactions and miRNA loading. Our findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism for the selective degradation of empty AGO that underlies a quality control process to ensure AGO function."	0

Here, we systematically examine the state changes of human pluripotent embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by the large-scale manipulation of single TFs. We establish 2,135 hESC lines, representing three clones each of 714 doxycycline (Dox)-inducible genes including 481 TFs, and obtain 26,998 microscopic cell images and 2,174 transcriptome datasets-RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarrays-48 h after the presence or absence of Dox. Interestingly, the expression of essentially all the genes, including genes located in heterochromatin regions, are perturbed by these TFs. TFs are also characterized by their ability to induce differentiation of hESCs into specific cell lineages. These analyses help to provide a way of classifying TFs and identifying specific sets of TFs for directing hESC differentiation into desired cell types."	0
"32726619"	"Proximal Tubule mTORC1 Is a Central Player in the Pathophysiology of Diabetic Nephropathy and Its Correction by SGLT2 Inhibitors.Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) increases the risk for mortality and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) attenuates the progression of DKD, especially in patients with advanced kidney disease. Herein, we show that in diabetes, mTORC1 activity is increased in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) along with enhanced tubule-interstitial fibrosis; this is prevented by SGLT2i. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 in RPTCs induces renal fibrosis and failure and abolishes the renal-protective effects of SGLT2i in diabetes. On the contrary, partial inhibition of mTORC1 in RPTCs prevents fibrosis and the decline in renal function. Stimulation of mTORC1 in RPTCs turns on a pro-fibrotic program in the renal cortex, whereas its inhibition in diabetes reverses the alterations in gene expression. We suggest that RPTC mTORC1 is a critical node that mediates kidney dysfunction in diabetes and the protective effects of SGLT2i by regulating fibrogenesis."	0

"32075757"	"A Dynamic Folded Hairpin Conformation Is Associated with α-Globin Activation in Erythroid Cells.We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the α-globin locus at the single-allele level in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and erythroid cells, combining polymer physics models and high-resolution Capture-C data. Model predictions are validated against independent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring pairwise distances, and Tri-C data identifying three-way contacts. The architecture is rearranged during the transition from ESCs to erythroid cells, associated with the activation of the globin genes. We find that in ESCs, the spatial organization conforms to a highly intermingled 3D structure involving non-specific contacts, whereas in erythroid cells the α-globin genes and their enhancers form a self-contained domain, arranged in a folded hairpin conformation, separated from intermingling flanking regions by a thermodynamic mechanism of micro-phase separation. The flanking regions are rich in convergent CTCF sites, which only marginally participate in the erythroid-specific gene-enhancer contacts, suggesting that beyond the interaction of CTCF sites, multiple molecular mechanisms cooperate to form an interacting domain."	0
"32470318"	"Ectosomal PKM2 Promotes HCC by Inducing Macrophage Differentiation and Remodeling the Tumor Microenvironment.Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles are important mediators of cell-to-cell communication during tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived ectosomes remodel the tumor microenvironment to facilitate HCC progression in an ectosomal PKM2-dependent manner. HCC-derived ectosomal PKM2 induced not only metabolic reprogramming in monocytes but also STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus to upregulate differentiation-associated transcription factors, leading to monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and tumor microenvironment remodeling. In HCC cells, sumoylation of PKM2 induced its plasma membrane targeting and subsequent ectosomal excretion via interactions with ARRDC1. The PKM2-ARRDC1 association in HCC was reinforced by macrophage-secreted cytokines/chemokines in a CCL1-CCR8 axis-dependent manner, further facilitating PKM2 excretion from HCC cells to form a feedforward regulatory loop for tumorigenesis. In the clinic, ectosomal PKM2 was clearly detected in the plasma of HCC patients. This study highlights a mechanism by which ectosomal PKM2 remodels the tumor microenvironment and reveals ectosomal PKM2 as a potential diagnostic marker for HCC."	1
"32101739"	"Redefining Single-Trial Memories in the Honeybee.Research on honeybee memory has led to a widely accepted model in which a single pairing of an odor stimulus with sucrose induces memories that are independent of protein synthesis but is unable to form protein-synthesis-dependent long-term memory (LTM). The latter is said to arise only after three or more pairings of odor and sucrose. Here, we show that this model underestimates the capacity of the bee brain to form LTMs after a unique appetitive experience. Using state-of-the art conditioning setups and individual-based analyses of conditioned responses, we found that protein-synthesis-dependent memories are formed already 4 h after the single conditioning trial and persist even 3 days later. These memories (4 h, 24 h, and 72 h) exhibit different dependencies on transcription and translation processes. Our results thus modify the traditional view of one-trial memories in an insect with a model status for memory research."	0
"32661194"	"The role of the I<sub>T</sub>-state in D76N β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin amyloid assembly: A crucial intermediate or an innocuous bystander?The D76N variant of human β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m) is the causative agent of a hereditary amyloid disease. Interestingly, D76N-associated amyloidosis has a distinctive pathology compared with aggregation of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m, which occurs in dialysis-related amyloidosis. A folding intermediate of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m, known as the I<sub>T</sub>-state, which contains a nonnative <i>trans</i> Pro-32, has been shown to be a key precursor of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m aggregation <i>in vitro</i> However, how a single amino acid substitution enhances the rate of aggregation of D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m and gives rise to a different amyloid disease remained unclear. Using real-time refolding experiments monitored by CD and NMR, we show that the folding mechanisms of WT- and D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m are conserved in that both proteins fold slowly via an I<sub>T</sub>-state that has similar structural properties. Surprisingly, however, direct measurement of the equilibrium population of I<sub>T</sub> using NMR showed no evidence for an increased population of the I<sub>T</sub>-state for D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m, ruling out previous models suggesting that this could explain its enhanced aggregation propensity. Producing a kinetically trapped analog of I<sub>T</sub> by deleting the N-terminal six amino acids increases the aggregation rate of WT-β<sub>2</sub>m but slows aggregation of D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m, supporting the view that although the folding mechanisms of the two proteins are conserved, their aggregation mechanisms differ. The results exclude the I<sub>T</sub>-state as the origin of the rapid aggregation of D76N-β<sub>2</sub>m, suggesting that other nonnative states must cause its high aggregation rate. The results highlight how a single substitution at a solvent-exposed site can affect the mechanism of aggregation and the resulting disease."	0
"32459988"	"Biomarker-Guided Development of DNA Repair Inhibitors.Anti-cancer drugs targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) exploit genetic or functional defects in this pathway through synthetic lethal mechanisms. For example, defects in homologous recombination (HR) repair arise in cancer cells through inherited or acquired mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes in the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway, and these tumors have been shown to be particularly sensitive to inhibitors of the base excision repair (BER) protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Recent work has identified additional genomic and functional assays of DNA repair that provide new predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for these targeted therapies. Here, we examine the development of selective agents targeting DNA repair, including PARP inhibitors; inhibitors of the DNA damage kinases ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), CHK1, WEE1, and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM); and inhibitors of classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) and alternative end joining (Alt EJ). We also review the biomarkers that guide the use of these agents and current clinical trials with these therapies."	0
"32492414"	"Chaperone-Mediated Protein Disaggregation Triggers Proteolytic Clearance of Intra-nuclear Protein Inclusions.The formation of insoluble inclusions in the cytosol and nucleus is associated with impaired protein homeostasis and is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the absence of the autophagic machinery, nuclear protein aggregates require a solubilization step preceding degradation by the 26S proteasome. Using yeast, we identify a nuclear protein quality control pathway required for the clearance of protein aggregates. The nuclear J-domain protein Apj1 supports protein disaggregation together with Hsp70 but independent of the canonical disaggregase Hsp104. Disaggregation mediated by Apj1/Hsp70 promotes turnover rather than refolding. A loss of Apj1 activity uncouples disaggregation from proteasomal turnover, resulting in accumulation of toxic soluble protein species. Endogenous substrates of the Apj1/Hsp70 pathway include both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which aggregate inside the nucleus upon proteotoxic stress. These findings demonstrate the coordinated activity of the Apj1/Hsp70 disaggregation system with the 26S proteasome in facilitating the clearance of toxic inclusions inside the nucleus."	0
"32375033"	"Challenges in Establishing Pure Lung Cancer Organoids Limit Their Utility for Personalized Medicine.Clinical implementation of tumor organoids for personalized medicine requires that pure tumor organoids can be reliably established. Here, we present our experience with organoid cultures from >70 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. We systematically evaluate several methods to identify tumor purity of organoids established from intrapulmonary tumors. Eighty percent of organoids from intrapulmonary lesions have a normal copy number profile, suggesting overgrowth by normal airway organoids (AOs). This is further supported by the failure to detect mutations found in the original tumor in organoids. Histomorphology alone is insufficient to determine tumor purity, but when combined with p63 immunostaining, tumor and normal AOs can be distinguished. Taking into account overgrowth by normal AOs, the establishment rate of pure NSCLC organoids is 17%. Therefore, current methods are insufficient to establish pure NSCLC organoids from intrapulmonary lesions. We discourage their use unless steps are taken to prevent overgrowth by normal AOs."	0
"31279659"	"PCIF1 Catalyzes m6Am mRNA Methylation to Regulate Gene Expression.mRNA modifications play important roles in regulating gene expression. One of the most abundant mRNA modifications is N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). Here, we demonstrate that m6Am is an evolutionarily conserved mRNA modification mediated by the Phosphorylated CTD Interacting Factor 1 (PCIF1), which catalyzes m6A methylation on 2-O-methylated adenine located at the 5' ends of mRNAs. Furthermore, PCIF1 catalyzes only 5' m6Am methylation of capped mRNAs but not internal m6A methylation in vitro and in vivo. To study the biological role of m6Am, we developed a robust methodology (m6Am-Exo-Seq) to map its transcriptome-wide distribution, which revealed no global crosstalk between m6Am and m6A under assayed conditions, suggesting that m6Am is functionally distinct from m6A. Importantly, we find that m6Am does not alter mRNA transcription or stability but negatively impacts cap-dependent translation of methylated mRNAs. Together, we identify the only human mRNA m6Am methyltransferase and demonstrate a mechanism of gene expression regulation through PCIF1-mediated m6Am mRNA methylation."	0
"32101749"	"Tumor-Derived Lactic Acid Contributes to the Paucity of Intratumoral ILC2s.Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are abundant in non-lymphoid tissues and increase following infectious and inflammatory insults. In solid tumors, however, ILC2s constitute a relatively small proportion of immune cells. Here, we show, using melanoma as a model, that while the IL-33/IL C2/eosinophil axis suppresses tumor growth, tumor-derived lactate attenuates the function and survival of ILC2s. Melanomas with reduced lactate production (LDHA<sup>low</sup>) are growth delayed and typified by an increased number of ILC2s compared with control tumors. Upon IL-33 stimulation, ILC2s accompanied by eosinophils more effectively restrain the growth of LDHA<sup>low</sup> tumors than control melanomas. Furthermore, database analysis reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LDHA and markers associated with ILC2s and the association of high expression of IL33 and an eosinophil marker SIGLEC8 with better overall survival in human cutaneous melanoma patients. This work demonstrates that the balance between the IL-33/ILC2/eosinophil axis and lactate production by tumor cells regulates melanoma growth."	0
"32755592"	"Marginal Zone Formation Requires ACKR3 Expression on B Cells.The marginal zone (MZ) contributes to the highly organized spleen microarchitecture. We show that expression of atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) defines two equal-sized populations of mouse MZ B cells (MZBs). ACKR3 is required for development of a functional MZ and for positioning of MZBs. Deletion of ACKR3 on B cells distorts the MZ, and MZBs fail to deliver antigens to follicles, reducing humoral responses. Reconstitution of MZ-deficient CD19<sup>ko</sup> mice shows that ACKR3<sup>-</sup> MZBs can differentiate into ACKR3<sup>+</sup> MZBs, but not vice versa. The lack of a MZ is rescued by adoptive transfer of ACKR3-sufficient, and less by ACKR3-deficient, follicular B cells (FoBs); hence, ACKR3 expression is crucial for establishment of the MZ. The inability of CD19<sup>ko</sup> mice to respond to T-independent antigen is rescued when ACKR3-proficient, but not ACKR3-deficient, FoBs are transferred. Accordingly, ACKR3-deficient FoBs are able to reconstitute the MZ if the niche is pre-established by ACKR3-proficient MZBs."	0

We provide mechanistic evidence for ribosomes attaching to the mRNA by threading the mRNA through the small subunit.

"32234486"	"Structure-Based Design of Prefusion-Stabilized Filovirus Glycoprotein Trimers.Ebola virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever, often leading to death in humans. The trimeric fusion glycoprotein (GP) is the sole target for neutralizing antibodies and is the major focus of vaccine development. Soluble GP ectodomains are unstable and mostly monomeric when not fused to a heterologous trimerization domain. Here, we report structure-based designs of Ebola and Marburg GP trimers based on a stabilizing mutation in the hinge loop in refolding region 1 and substitution of a partially buried charge at the interface of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. The combined substitutions (T577P and K588F) substantially increased trimer expression for Ebola GP proteins. We determined the crystal structure of stabilized GP from the Makona Zaire ebolavirus strain without a trimerization domain or complexed ligand. The structure reveals that the stabilized GP adopts the same trimeric prefusion conformation, provides insight into triggering of GP conformational changes, and should inform future filovirus vaccine development."	0
"31999954"	"Autism-Misregulated eIF4G Microexons Control Synaptic Translation and Higher Order Cognitive Functions.Microexons represent the most highly conserved class of alternative splicing, yet their functions are poorly understood. Here, we focus on closely related neuronal microexons overlapping prion-like domains in the translation initiation factors, eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, the splicing of which is activity dependent and frequently disrupted in autism. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of these microexons selectively upregulates synaptic proteins that control neuronal activity and plasticity and further triggers a gene expression program mirroring that of activated neurons. Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning, and memory deficits, accompanied by altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We provide evidence that the eIF4G microexons function as a translational brake by causing ribosome stalling, through their propensity to promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP. The results thus reveal an autism-disrupted mechanism by which alternative splicing specializes neuronal translation to control higher order cognitive functioning."	0

For the precise encoding of sound qualities, receptor potentials are shaped by K<sup>+</sup> conductances tuning the properties of the IHC membrane. Using patch-clamp and computational modeling, we unravel this membrane specialization showing that IHCs express an exclusive repertoire of six voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductances mediated by K<sub>v</sub>1.8, K<sub>v</sub>7.4, K<sub>v</sub>11.1, K<sub>v</sub>12.1, and BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels. All channels are active at rest but are triggered differentially during sound stimulation. This enables non-saturating tuning over a far larger potential range than in IHCs expressing fewer current entities. Each conductance contributes to optimizing responses, but the combined activity of all channels synergistically improves phase locking and the dynamic range of intensities that IHCs can encode. Conversely, hypothetical simpler IHCs appear limited to encode only certain aspects (frequency or intensity). The exclusive channel repertoire of IHCs thus constitutes an evolutionary adaptation to encode complex sound through multifaceted receptor potentials."	0
"32023455"	"Loss of Human TGS1 Hypermethylase Promotes Increased Telomerase RNA and Telomere Elongation.Biogenesis of the human telomerase RNA (hTR) involves a complex series of posttranscriptional modifications, including hypermethylation of the 5' mono-methylguanosine cap to a tri-methylguanosine cap (TMG). How the TMG cap affects hTR maturation is unknown. Here, we show that depletion of trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), the enzyme responsible for cap hypermethylation, increases levels of hTR and telomerase. Diminished trimethylation increases hTR association with the cap-binding complex (CBC) and with Sm chaperone proteins. Loss of TGS1 causes an increase in accumulation of mature hTR in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm compared with controls. In TGS1 mutant cells, increased hTR assembles with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein to yield elevated active telomerase complexes and increased telomerase activity, resulting in telomere elongation in cultured human cells. Our results show that TGS1-mediated hypermethylation of the hTR cap inhibits hTR accumulation, restrains levels of assembled telomerase, and limits telomere elongation."	0

"32905763"	"OPG Production Matters Where It Happened.Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a circulating decoy receptor for RANKL, a multifunctional cytokine essential for the differentiation of tissue-specific cells in bone and immune systems such as osteoclasts, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), and intestinal microfold cells (M cells). However, it is unknown whether OPG functions only at the production site or circulates to other tissues acting in an endocrine fashion. Here we explore the cellular source of OPG by generating OPG-floxed mice and show that locally produced OPG, rather than circulating OPG, is crucial for bone and immune homeostasis. Deletion of OPG in osteoblastic cells leads to severe osteopenia without affecting serum OPG. Deletion of locally produced OPG increases mTEC and M cell numbers while retaining the normal serum OPG level. This study shows that OPG limits its functions within the tissue where it was produced, illuminating the importance of local regulation of the RANKL system."	0

We find that the microRNA miR-9 is upregulated in both bone marrow-derived DCs and conventional DC1s but not in conventional DC2s following stimulation. miR-9 expression in BMDCs and conventional DC1s promotes enhanced DC activation and function, including the ability to stimulate T cell activation and control tumor growth. We find that miR-9 regulated the expression of several negative regulators of transcription, including the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group factor 6 (Pcgf6).

To address how these signals orchestrate patterning, we transplant sources of fluorescently tagged Nodal and BMP into zebrafish embryos, robustly inducing the formation of secondary axes. Nodal and BMP signal non-cell-autonomously and form similar protein gradients in this context, but the signaling range of Nodal (pSmad2) is shorter than the BMP range (pSmad5). This yields a localized region of pSmad2 activity around the Nodal source, overlapping with a broad domain of pSmad5 activity across the embryo. Cell fates induced in various regions stereotypically correlate with pSmad2-to-pSmad5 ratios and can even be induced BMP- and Nodal-independently with different ratios of constitutively active Smad2 and Smad5. Strikingly, we find that Smad2 and Smad5 antagonize each other for specific cell fates, providing a mechanism for how cells integrate and discriminate between overlapping signals during development."	0

However, to date, the organizing principles that underlie the morphogenesis of this network and that shape the initial process of cells' finding one another remain elusive. Here, we identify a mechanism that allows cells to form networks by mechanically reorganizing and stiffening their extracellular matrix, independent of chemical guidance cues. Interestingly, we find that this cellular self-organization strongly depends on the connectivity, plasticity, and topology of the surrounding matrix; cell contractility; and cell density. Cells rearrange the matrix and form bridges of matrix material that are stiffer than their surroundings, thus creating a durotactic track for the initiation of cell protrusions and cell-cell contacts. This contractility-based communication via strain stiffening and matrix rearrangement might be a general organizing principle during tissue development or regeneration."	0
"31006538"	"Intrinsically Disordered Protein TEX264 Mediates ER-phagy.Certain proteins and organelles can be selectively degraded by autophagy. Typical substrates and receptors of selective autophagy have LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) that bind to autophagosomal LC3 and GABARAP family proteins. Here, we performed a differential interactome screen using wild-type LC3B and a LIR recognition-deficient mutant and identified TEX264 as a receptor for autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy). TEX264 is an ER protein with a single transmembrane domain and a LIR motif. TEX264 interacts with LC3 and GABARAP family proteins more efficiently and is expressed more ubiquitously than previously known ER-phagy receptors. ER-phagy is profoundly blocked by deletion of TEX264 alone and almost completely by additional deletion of FAM134B and CCPG1.

"30733118"	"Reciprocal Roles of Tom7 and OMA1 during Mitochondrial Import and Activation of PINK1.Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) can cause recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Import arrest results in PINK1 kinase activation specifically on damaged mitochondria, triggering Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Here, we show that PINK1 import is less dependent on Tim23 than on mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). We identified a negatively charged amino acid cluster motif that is evolutionarily conserved just C-terminal to the PINK1 transmembrane. PINK1 that fails to accumulate at the outer mitochondrial membrane, either by mutagenesis of this negatively charged motif or by deletion of Tom7, is imported into depolarized mitochondria and cleaved by the OMA1 protease. Some PD patient mutations also are defective in import arrest and are rescued by the suppression of OMA1, providing a new potential druggable target for PD. These results suggest that ΔΨm loss-dependent PINK1 import arrest does not result solely from Tim23 inactivation but also through an actively regulated ""tug of war"" between Tom7 and OMA1."	0

Postnatally, Tbr1 conditional knockout (CKO) mutants and constitutive heterozygotes have immature dendritic spines and reduced synaptic density. Tbr1 regulates expression of several genes that underlie synaptic defects, including a kinesin (Kif1a) and a WNT-signaling ligand (Wnt7b). Furthermore, Tbr1 mutant corticothalamic neurons have reduced thalamic axonal arborization. LiCl and a GSK3β inhibitor, two WNT-signaling agonists, robustly rescue the dendritic spines and the synaptic and axonal defects, suggesting that this could have relevance for therapeutic approaches in some forms of ASD."	0
"32640233"	"Theta Oscillations Coincide with Sustained Hyperpolarization in CA3 Pyramidal Cells, Underlying Decreased Firing.Brain states modulate the membrane potential dynamics of neurons, influencing the functional repertoire of the network. Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, which preferentially occurs during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and a reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta, as observed in ensemble recordings."	0
"32294431"	"Network Analysis of Murine Cortical Dynamics Implicates Untuned Neurons in Visual Stimulus Coding.Unbiased and dense sampling of large populations of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) reveals two functional sub-populations: neurons tuned and untuned to drifting gratings. Whether functional interactions between these two groups contribute to the representation of visual stimuli is unclear. To examine these interactions, we summarize the population partial pairwise correlation structure as a directed and weighted graph. We find that tuned and untuned neurons have distinct topological properties, with untuned neurons occupying central positions in functional networks (FNs). Implementation of a decoder that utilizes the topology of these FNs yields accurate decoding of visual stimuli. We further show that decoding performance degrades comparably following manipulations of either tuned or untuned neurons. Our results demonstrate that untuned neurons are an integral component of V1 FNs and suggest that network interactions contain information about the stimulus that is accessible to downstream elements."	0
"32640224"	"Cyclin N-Terminal Domain-Containing-1 Coordinates Meiotic Crossover Formation with Cell-Cycle Progression in a Cyclin-Independent Manner.During mammalian meiotic prophase I, programmed DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by non-crossover or crossover events, the latter predominantly occurring via the class I crossover pathway and requiring the cyclin N-terminal domain-containing 1(CNTD1) protein. Using an epitope-tagged Cntd1 allele, we detect a short isoform of CNTD1 in vivo that lacks a predicted N-terminal cyclin domain and does not bind cyclin-dependent kinases. Instead, we find that the short-form CNTD1 variant associates with components of the replication factor C (RFC) machinery to facilitate crossover formation, and with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, CDC34, to regulate ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the WEE1 kinase, thereby modulating cell-cycle progression. We propose that these interactions facilitate a role for CNTD1 as a stop-go regulator during prophase I, ensuring accurate and complete crossover formation before allowing metaphase progression and the first meiotic division."	0
"32277910"	"Division of Labor between PCNA Loaders in DNA Replication and Sister Chromatid Cohesion Establishment.Concomitant with DNA replication, the chromosomal cohesin complex establishes cohesion between newly replicated sister chromatids. Several replication-fork-associated ""cohesion establishment factors,"" including the multifunctional Ctf18-RFC complex, aid this process in as yet unknown ways. Here, we show that Ctf18-RFC's role in sister chromatid cohesion correlates with PCNA loading but is separable from its role in the replication checkpoint. Ctf18-RFC loads PCNA with a slight preference for the leading strand, which is dispensable for DNA replication. Conversely, the canonical Rfc1-RFC complex preferentially loads PCNA onto the lagging strand, which is crucial for DNA replication but dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion. The downstream effector of Ctf18-RFC is cohesin acetylation, which we place toward a late step during replication maturation. Our results suggest that Ctf18-RFC enriches and balances PCNA levels at the replication fork, beyond the needs of DNA replication, to promote establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and possibly other post-replicative processes."	0

However, it remains less clear if diet-dependent host signaling mechanisms also influence these associations. Using Drosophila, we show here that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/Relish, an innate immune transcription factor emerging as a signaling node linking nutrient-immune-metabolic interactions, is vital to adapt gut microbiota species composition to host diet macronutrient composition. We find that Relish is required within midgut enterocytes to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations, an important bacterial mediator of nutritional symbiosis, and thus modulate microbiota composition in response to dietary adaptation. Relish limits diet-dependent transcriptional inducibility of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4E-BP/Thor to control microbiota composition. Furthermore, maintaining cap-dependent translation in response to dietary adaptation is critical to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations. These results highlight that NF-κB-dependent host signaling mechanisms, in coordination with host translation control, shape diet-microbiota interactions."	0

We studied the molecular profile and function of PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in order to understand the mechanisms underlying their role in fibrosis versus regeneration. We show that PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells are essential for tissue revascularization and restructuring through injury-stimulated remodeling of stromal and vascular components, context-dependent clonal expansion, and ultimate removal of pro-fibrotic PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>-derived cells. Tissue ischemia modulates the PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> phenotype toward cells capable of remodeling the extracellular matrix and inducing cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, likely favoring tissue repair.

The disease presents with a complex spectrum of genomic aberrations, but the pharmacological consequences of these aberrations are partly unknown. Here, we report an integrated pharmacogenomic analysis of 100 patient-derived GBM cell cultures from the human glioma cell culture (HGCC) cohort. Exploring 1,544 drugs, we find that GBM has two main pharmacological subgroups, marked by differential response to proteasome inhibitors and mutually exclusive aberrations in TP53 and CDKN2A/B. We confirm this trend in cell and in xenotransplantation models, and identify both Bcl-2 family inhibitors and p53 activators as potentiators of proteasome inhibitors in GBM cells. We can further predict the responses of individual cell cultures to several existing drug classes, presenting opportunities for drug repurposing and design of stratified trials.

"31104896"	"Co-transcriptional Loading of RNA Export Factors Shapes the Human Transcriptome.During gene expression, RNA export factors are mainly known for driving nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. While early studies suggested that the exon junction complex (EJC) provides a binding platform for them, subsequent work proposed that they are only recruited by the cap binding complex to the 5' end of RNAs, as part of TREX. Using iCLIP, we show that the export receptor Nxf1 and two TREX subunits, Alyref and Chtop, are recruited to the whole mRNA co-transcriptionally via splicing but before 3' end processing. Consequently, Alyref alters splicing decisions and Chtop regulates alternative polyadenylation. Alyref is recruited to the 5' end of RNAs by CBC, and our data reveal subsequent binding to RNAs near EJCs. We demonstrate that eIF4A3 stimulates Alyref deposition not only on spliced RNAs close to EJC sites but also on single-exon transcripts. Our study reveals mechanistic insights into the co-transcriptional recruitment of mRNA export factors and how this shapes the human transcriptome."	0

Until now, the dogma has been that HIV-1 lacks O-linked carbohydrate on Env. Here we show that a subset of patient-derived HIV-1 isolates contain O-linked carbohydrate on the variable 1 (V1) domain of Env gp120. We demonstrate the presence of this O-glycosylation both on virions and on gp120 expressed as a secreted protein. Further, we establish that these O-linked glycans can confer a more than 1,000-fold decrease in neutralization sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) to V3-glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies. These findings uncover a structural modification to the HIV-1 Env and suggest a functional role in promoting viral escape from one category of broadly neutralizing antibodies."	0
"31101498"	"Analysis of the Human Kinome and Phosphatome by Mass Cytometry Reveals Overexpression-Induced Effects on Cancer-Related Signaling.Kinase and phosphatase overexpression drives tumorigenesis and drug resistance. We previously developed a mass-cytometry-based single-cell proteomics approach that enables quantitative assessment of overexpression effects on cell signaling. Here, we applied this approach in a human kinome- and phosphatome-wide study to assess how 649 individually overexpressed proteins modulated cancer-related signaling in HEK293T cells in an abundance-dependent manner. Based on these data, we expanded the functional classification of human kinases and phosphatases and showed that the overexpression effects include non-catalytic roles. We detected 208 previously unreported signaling relationships. The signaling dynamics analysis indicated that the overexpression of ERK-specific phosphatases sustains proliferative signaling. This suggests a phosphatase-driven mechanism of cancer progression. Moreover, our analysis revealed a drug-resistant mechanism through which overexpression of tyrosine kinases, including SRC, FES, YES1, and BLK, induced MEK-independent ERK activation in melanoma A375 cells. These proteins could predict drug sensitivity to BRAF-MEK concurrent inhibition in cells carrying BRAF mutations."	0
"32532796"	"A myelin basic protein fragment induces sexually dimorphic transcriptome signatures of neuropathic pain in mice.In the peripheral nerve, mechanosensitive axons are insulated by myelin, a multilamellar membrane formed by Schwann cells. Here, we offer first evidence that a myelin degradation product induces mechanical hypersensitivity and global transcriptomics changes in a sex-specific manner. Focusing on downstream signaling events of the functionally active 84-104 myelin basic protein (MBP(84-104)) fragment released after nerve injury, we demonstrate that exposing the sciatic nerve to MBP(84-104) via endoneurial injection produces robust mechanical hypersensitivity in female, but not in male, mice. RNA-seq and systems biology analysis revealed a striking sexual dimorphism in molecular signatures of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord response, not observed at the nerve injection site. Mechanistically, intra-sciatic MBP(84-104) induced phospholipase C (PLC)-driven (females) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-driven (males) phospholipid metabolism (tier 1). PLC/inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and estrogen receptor co-regulation in spinal cord yielded Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nociceptive signaling induction in females that was suppressed in males (tier 2). IP3R inactivation by intrathecal xestospongin C attenuated the female-specific hypersensitivity induced by MBP(84-104). According to sustained sensitization in tiers 1 and 2, T cell-related signaling spreads to the DRG and spinal cord in females, but remains localized to the sciatic nerve in males (tier 3). These results are consistent with our previous finding that MBP(84-104)-induced pain is T cell-dependent. In summary, an autoantigenic peptide endogenously released in nerve injury triggers multisite, sex-specific transcriptome changes, leading to neuropathic pain only in female mice. MBP(84-104) acts through sustained co-activation of metabolic, estrogen receptor-mediated nociceptive, and autoimmune signaling programs."	0
"31914387"	"Differential Coupling of Adult-Born Granule Cells to Parvalbumin and Somatostatin Interneurons.A strong GABAergic tone imposes sparse levels of activity in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This balance is challenged by the addition of new granule cells (GCs) with high excitability. How developing GCs integrate within local inhibitory networks remains unknown. We used optogenetics to study synaptogenesis between new GCs and GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV-INs) and somatostatin (SST-INs). PV-INs target the soma, and synapses become mature after 6 weeks. This transition is accelerated by exposure to an enriched environment. PV-INs exert efficient control of GC spiking and participate in both feedforward and feedback loops, a mechanism that would favor lateral inhibition and sparse coding. SST-INs target the dendrites, and synapses mature after 8 weeks. Outputs from GCs onto PV-INs develop faster than those onto SST-INs. Our results reveal a long-lasting transition wherein adult-born neurons remain poorly coupled to inhibition, which might enhance activity-dependent plasticity of input and output synapses."	0

Here, we show that infection of the male lineage with the common human parasite Toxoplasma results in transgenerational behavioral changes in offspring in a sex-dependent manner. Small RNA sequencing of sperm reveals significant transcriptional differences of infected animals compared to controls. Zygote microinjection of total small RNA from sperm of infected mice partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotype of naturally born offspring, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism of behavioral inheritance in the first generation. Our results demonstrate that sperm epigenetic factors can contribute to intergenerational inheritance of behavioral changes after pathogenic infection, which could have major public health implications."	0

Current experiments in rats investigate whether GDF15 induces an aversive visceral malaise-based state that mediates its acute anorectic effect and, through aversion conditioning, exerts longer-term anorexia. Visceral malaise, conditioned affective food responses (taste reactivity), gastric emptying (GE), food intake, and body weight are evaluated after acute and chronic systemic dosing of GDF15 or long-acting Fc-GDF15. Pica, a marker of visceral malaise, is present at all anorectic GDF15 doses. Moreover, malaise induced by GDF15 does not decline over time, suggesting the lack of an improved tolerance after prolonged exposure. One association between GDF15 and novel food conditions a disgust/aversive response that persists beyond GDF15 acute action. Delayed GE is not a requirement for GDF15-induced anorexia.

This 2-5A-mediated decay (2-5AMD) is a conserved stress response switching global protein synthesis from homeostasis to production of interferons (IFNs). To understand this mechanism, we examined 2-5AMD in human cells and found that it triggers polysome collapse characteristic of inhibited translation initiation. We determined that translation initiation complexes and ribosomes purified from translation-arrested cells remain functional. However, spike-in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed cell-wide decay of basal mRNAs accompanied by rapid accumulation of mRNAs encoding innate immune proteins. Our data attribute this 2-5AMD evasion to better stability of defense mRNAs and positive feedback in the IFN response amplified by RNase L-resistant molecules. We conclude that 2-5AMD and transcription act in concert to refill mammalian cells with defense mRNAs, thereby ""prioritizing"" the synthesis of innate immune proteins."	0

To determine the physiological function of TMEM106B, we generated TMEM106B-deficient mice. These mice develop proximal axonal swellings caused by drastically enlarged LAMP1-positive vacuoles, increased retrograde axonal transport of lysosomes, and accumulation of lipofuscin and autophagosomes. Giant vacuoles specifically accumulate at the distal end and within the axon initial segment, but not in peripheral nerves or at axon terminals, resulting in an impaired facial-nerve-dependent motor performance. These data implicate TMEM106B in mediating the axonal transport of LAMP1-positive organelles in motoneurons and axonal sorting at the initial segment. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how TMEM106B affects lysosomal proteolysis and degradative capacity in neurons."	0
"30612878"	"RNA Polymerase I Activators Count and Adjust Ribosomal RNA Gene Copy Number.Ribosome is the most abundant RNA-protein complex in a cell, and many copies of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) have to be maintained. However, arrays of tandemly repeated rDNA genes can lose the copies by intra-repeat recombination. Loss of the rDNA copies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is counteracted by gene amplification whereby the number of rDNA repeats stabilizes around 150 copies, suggesting the presence of a monitoring mechanism that counts and adjusts the number. Here, we report that, in response to rDNA copy loss, the upstream activating factor (UAF) for RNA polymerase I that transcribes the rDNA is released and directly binds to a RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene, SIR2, whose gene products silence rDNA recombination, to repress. We show that the amount of UAF determines the rDNA copy number that is stably maintained. UAF ensures rDNA production not only by rDNA transcription activation but also by its copy-number maintenance."	0

We identify the integrin α<sub>V</sub>β3 expressed on a subset of sensory neurons as the periostin receptor. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we inhibited the function of neuronal integrin α<sub>V</sub>β3, which significantly reduces periostin-induced itch in mice. Furthermore, we show that the cytokine TSLP, the application of AD-causing MC903 (calcipotriol), and house dust mites all induce periostin secretion. Finally, we establish that the JAK/STAT pathway is a key regulator of periostin secretion in keratinocytes.

MYC directly binds SPT5, recruits SPT5 to promoters, and enables the CDK7-dependent transfer of SPT5 onto Pol II. Consistent with known functions of SPT5, MYC is required for fast and processive transcription elongation. Intriguingly, the high levels of MYC that are expressed in tumors sequester SPT5 into non-functional complexes, thereby decreasing the expression of growth-suppressive genes. Altogether, these results argue that MYC controls the productive assembly of processive Pol II elongation complexes and provide insight into how oncogenic levels of MYC permit uncontrolled cellular growth."	0

Here, we use a tension sensor based on ZO-1, a scaffolding protein that links the junctional membrane to the cytoskeleton, to determine if tight junctions carry a mechanical load. Our data indicate that ZO-1 is under mechanical tension and that forces acting on ZO-1 are regulated by extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and the junctional adhesion molecule JAM-A. JAM-A depletion stimulates junctional recruitment of p114RhoGEF/ARHGEF18, mechanical tension on ZO-1, and traction forces at focal adhesions. p114RhoGEF is required for activation of junctional actomyosin activity and tight junction integrity on stiff but not soft ECM.

Platelets license NLRP3 transcription, thereby enhancing ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activity, and IL-1β secretion. Platelets influence IL-1β production in vivo, and blood platelet counts correlate with plasmatic IL-1β levels in malaria. Furthermore, we reveal an enriched platelet gene signature among the highest-expressed transcripts in IL-1β-driven autoinflammatory diseases. The platelet effect is independent of cell-to-cell contact, platelet-derived lipid mediators, purines, nucleic acids, and a host of platelet cytokines, and it involves the triggering of calcium-sensing receptors on macrophages. Hence, platelets provide an additional layer of regulation of inflammasomes and IL-1-driven inflammation."	0

"32001510"	"Mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling drives formation of cytoplasmic chromatin and inflammation in senescence.Cellular senescence is a potent tumor suppressor mechanism but also contributes to aging and aging-related diseases. Senescence is characterized by a stable cell cycle arrest and a complex proinflammatory secretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently discovered that cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), extruded from the nucleus of senescent cells, trigger the SASP through activation of the innate immunity cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. However, the upstream signaling events that instigate CCF formation remain unknown. Here, we show that dysfunctional mitochondria, linked to down-regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, trigger a ROS-JNK retrograde signaling pathway that drives CCF formation and hence the SASP. JNK links to 53BP1, a nuclear protein that negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection and CCF formation. Importantly, we show that low-dose HDAC inhibitors restore expression of most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, improve mitochondrial function, and suppress CCFs and the SASP in senescent cells. In mouse models, HDAC inhibitors also suppress oxidative stress, CCF, inflammation, and tissue damage caused by senescence-inducing irradiation and/or acetaminophen-induced mitochondria dysfunction. Overall, our findings outline an extended mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway that initiates formation of CCF during senescence and is a potential target for drug-based interventions to inhibit the proaging SASP."	0

Full engagement of effector T cells occurs only when signaling exceeds a critical threshold that enables induction of immune response genes carrying an epigenetic memory of prior activation. Here we investigate the underlying mechanisms causing the suppression of normal immune responses when T cells are rendered anergic by tolerance induction. By performing an integrated analysis of signaling, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression, we demonstrate that immunological tolerance is established when both signaling to and chromatin priming of immune response genes are weakened. In parallel, chromatin priming of immune-repressive genes becomes boosted, rendering them sensitive to low levels of signaling below the threshold needed to activate immune response genes.

Here, we perform a targeted chimeric screen between Piezo1 and the closely related isoform Piezo2 and use electrophysiology to characterize their inactivation kinetics during mechanical stimulation. We identify three small subdomains within the extracellular cap that individually can confer the distinct kinetics of inactivation of Piezo2 onto Piezo1. We further show by cysteine crosslinking that conformational flexibility of these subdomains is required for mechanical activation to occur and that electrostatic interactions functionally couple the cap to the extensive blades, which have been proposed to function as sensors of membrane curvature and tension. This study provides a demonstration of internal gating motions involved in mechanotransduction by Piezo1."	0
"30979585"	"Structural and Functional Insights into Host Death Domains Inactivation by the Bacterial Arginine GlcNAcyltransferase Effector.Enteropathogenic E. coli NleB and related type III effectors catalyze arginine GlcNAcylation of death domain (DD) proteins to block host defense, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we solve crystal structures of NleB alone and in complex with FADD-DD, UDP, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> as well as NleB-GlcNAcylated DDs of TRADD and RIPK1. NleB adopts a GT-A fold with a unique helix-pair insertion to hold FADD-DD; the interface contacts explain the selectivity of NleB for certain DDs. The acceptor arginine is fixed into a cleft, in which Glu253 serves as a base to activate the guanidinium. Analyses of the enzyme-substrate complex and the product structures reveal an inverting sugar-transfer reaction and a detailed catalytic mechanism. These structural insights are validated by mutagenesis analyses of NleB-mediated GlcNAcylation in vitro and its function in mouse infection. Our study builds a structural framework for understanding of NleB-catalyzed arginine GlcNAcylation of host death domain."	0

We develop an inducible mouse model for the sequential ablation of UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown and brite/beige adipocytes in adult mice. We demonstrate that activated brown adipocytes can increase systemic energy expenditure (EE) by 30%, while the contribution of brite/beige UCP1<sup>+</sup> cells is <5%. Notably, UCP1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes do not contribute to circulating FGF21 levels, either at room temperature or after cold exposure. We demonstrate that the FGF21-mediated effects on EE and glucose homeostasis are partially dependent on the presence of UCP1<sup>+</sup> cells, while the effect on weight loss is not. In conclusion, acute UCP1<sup>+</sup> cell deletion may be a useful model to study the impact of brown and brite/beige adipocytes on metabolism."	0

We investigate the role of autophagy in equipping human memory T cells to acquire tissue residence and maintain functionality in the immunosuppressive liver environment. By performing ex vivo staining of freshly isolated cells from human liver tissue, we find that an increased rate of basal autophagy is a hallmark of intrahepatic lymphocytes, particularly liver-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with increased autophagy are those best able to proliferate and mediate cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Conversely, blocking autophagy induction results in the accumulation of depolarized mitochondria, a feature of exhausted T cells. Primary hepatic stellate cells or the prototypic hepatic cytokine interleukin (IL)-15 induce autophagy in parallel with tissue-homing/retention markers. Inhibition of T cell autophagy abrogates tissue-residence programming. Thus, upregulation of autophagy adapts CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to combat mitochondrial depolarization, optimize functionality, and acquire tissue residence."	0

Here, we investigate the representation of odor-reward associations within two areas recipient of dense olfactory input, the posterior piriform cortex (pPCX) and the olfactory tubercle (OT), using electrophysiological recordings from mice engaged in reward-based learning. Neurons in both regions represent conditioned odors and do so with similar information content, yet the proportion of neurons recruited by conditioned rewarded odors and the magnitudes and durations of their responses are greater in the OT. Using fiber photometry, we find that OT D1-type dopamine-receptor-expressing neurons flexibly represent odors based on reward associations, and using optogenetics, we show that these neurons influence behavioral engagement. These findings contribute to a model whereby OT D1 neurons support odor-guided motivated behaviors."	0
"31914396"	"Molecular Mechanism of RNA Recognition by Zinc-Finger Antiviral Protein.Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host antiviral factor that specifically restricts a wide range of viruses. ZAP selectively binds to CG-dinucleotide-enriched RNA sequences and recruits multiple RNA degradation machines to degrade target viral RNA. However, the molecular mechanism and structural basis for ZAP recognition of specific RNA are not clear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ZAP N-terminal domain bound to a CG-rich single-stranded RNA, providing the molecular basis for its specific recognition of a CG dinucleotide and additional guanine and cytosine. The four zinc fingers of ZAP adopt a unique architecture and form extensive interactions with RNA. Mutations of both protein and RNA at the RNA-ZAP interacting surface reduce the in vitro binding affinity and cellular antiviral activity. This work reveals the molecular mechanism of ZAP recognition of specific target RNA and also provides insights into the mechanism by which ZAP coordinates downstream RNA degradation processes."	0
"31471187"	"Co-temporal Force and Fluorescence Measurements Reveal a Ribosomal Gear Shift Mechanism of Translation Regulation by Structured mRNAs.The movement of ribosomes on mRNA is often interrupted by secondary structures that present mechanical barriers and play a central role in translation regulation. We investigate how ribosomes couple their internal conformational changes with the activity of translocation factor EF-G to unwind mRNA secondary structures using high-resolution optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence capability. We find that hairpin opening occurs during EF-G-catalyzed translocation and is driven by the forward rotation of the small subunit head. Modulating the magnitude of the hairpin barrier by force shows that ribosomes respond to strong barriers by shifting their operation to an alternative 7-fold-slower kinetic pathway prior to translocation. Shifting into a slow gear results from an allosteric switch in the ribosome that may allow it to exploit thermal fluctuations to overcome mechanical barriers. Finally, we observe that ribosomes occasionally open the hairpin in two successive sub-codon steps, revealing a previously unobserved translocation intermediate."	0
"32142684"	"Dynamic Regulation of Mitochondrial Import by the Ubiquitin System.Mitochondria import nearly their entire proteome from the cytoplasm by translocating precursor proteins through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. Here, we show dynamic regulation of mitochondrial import by the ubiquitin system. Acute pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of the mitochondrial deubiquitinase (DUB) USP30 triggers accumulation of Ub-substrates that are normally localized inside the mitochondria. Mitochondrial import of USP30 substrates is impaired in USP30 knockout (KO) cells, suggesting that deubiquitination promotes efficient import. Upstream of USP30, the E3 ligase March5 ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins whose eventual import depends on USP30. In USP30 KOs, exogenous March5 expression induces accumulation of unimported translocation intermediates that are degraded by the proteasomes. In USP30 KO mice, TOM subunits have reduced abundance across multiple tissues. Together these data highlight how protein import into a subcellular compartment can be regulated by ubiquitination and deubiquitination by E3 ligase and DUB machinery positioned at the gate."	0
"32032531"	"Imprinted Maternally Expressed microRNAs Antagonize Paternally Driven Gene Programs in Neurons.Imprinted genes with parental-biased allelic expression are frequently co-regulated and enriched in common biological pathways. Here, we functionally characterize a large cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed from the maternally inherited allele (""maternally expressed"") to explore the molecular and cellular consequences of imprinted miRNA activity. Using an induced neuron (iN) culture system, we show that maternally expressed miRNAs from the miR-379/410 cluster direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to transcriptional and developmental regulators, including paternally expressed transcripts like Plagl1. Maternal deletion of this imprinted miRNA cluster resulted in increased protein levels of several targets and upregulation of a broader transcriptional program regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal function. A subset of the transcriptional changes resulting from miR-379/410 deletion can be attributed to de-repression of Plagl1. These data suggest maternally expressed miRNAs antagonize paternally driven gene programs in neurons."	0
"32726622"	"PTPN2 Deficiency Enhances Programmed T Cell Expansion and Survival Capacity of Activated T Cells.Manipulating molecules that impact T cell receptor (TCR) or cytokine signaling, such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), has significant potential for advancing T cell-based immunotherapies. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PTPN2 impacts the activation, survival, and memory formation of T cells. We find that PTPN2 deficiency renders cells in vivo and in vitro less dependent on survival-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins. Altogether, our data underline the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN2 in T cell-based therapies to augment the number and survival capacity of antigen-specific T cells."	0
"32669361"	"A comprehensive analysis of Rab GTPases reveals a role for Rab34 in serum starvation-induced primary ciliogenesis.Primary cilia are sensors of chemical and mechanical signals in the extracellular environment. The formation of primary cilia (<i>i.e.</i> ciliogenesis) requires dynamic membrane trafficking events, and several Rab small GTPases, key regulators of membrane trafficking, have recently been reported to participate in ciliogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms of Rab-mediated membrane trafficking during ciliogenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used a collection of siRNAs against 62 human Rabs to perform a comprehensive knockdown screening for Rabs that regulate serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in human telomerase reverse transcriptase retinal pigment epithelium 1 (hTERT-RPE1) cells and succeeded in identifying Rab34 as an essential Rab. Knockout (KO) of Rab34, but not of Rabs previously reported to regulate ciliogenesis (<i>e.g.</i> Rab8 and Rab10) in hTERT-RPE1 cells, drastically impaired serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis. Rab34 was also required for serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in NIH/3T3 cells and MCF10A cells but not for ciliogenesis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II cysts. We then attempted to identify a specific region(s) of Rab34 that is essential for ciliogenesis by performing deletion and mutation analyses of Rab34. Unexpectedly, instead of a specific sequence in the switch II region, which is generally important for recognizing effector proteins (<i>e.g.</i> Rab interacting lysosomal protein [RILP]), a unique long N-terminal region of Rab34 before the conserved GTPase domain was found to be essential. These findings suggest that Rab34 is an atypical Rab that regulates serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis through its unique N-terminal region."	0

While previous studies of pioneer factors have revealed their functions in transcriptional regulation, pioneer factors that open chromatin for other physiological events remain undetermined. In this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Spruce and colleagues (pp. 398-412) report the functional significance of a ""pioneer complex"" in mouse meiotic recombination. This complex, comprised of the zinc finger DNA-binding protein PRDM9 and the SNF2 family chromatin remodeler HELLS, exposes nucleosomal DNA to designate the sites of DNA double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination. Both HELLS and PRDM9 are required for the determination of these recombination hot spots. Through the identification of a pioneer complex for meiotic recombination, this study broadens the conceptual scope of pioneer factors, indicating their functional significance in biological processes beyond transcriptional regulation."	0

"32735772"	"A UPR-Induced Soluble ER-Phagy Receptor Acts with VAPs to Confer ER Stress Resistance.Autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy) is triggered by ER stress in diverse organisms. However, molecular mechanisms governing ER stress-induced ER-phagy remain insufficiently understood. Here we report that ER stress-induced ER-phagy in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires Epr1, a soluble Atg8-interacting ER-phagy receptor. Epr1 localizes to the ER through interacting with integral ER membrane proteins VAPs. Bridging an Atg8-VAP association is the main ER-phagy role of Epr1, as it can be bypassed by an artificial Atg8-VAP tether. VAPs contribute to ER-phagy not only by tethering Atg8 to the ER membrane, but also by maintaining the ER-plasma membrane contact. Epr1 is upregulated during ER stress by the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator Ire1. Loss of Epr1 reduces survival against ER stress. Conversely, increasing Epr1 expression suppresses the ER-phagy defect and ER stress sensitivity of cells lacking Ire1. Our findings expand and deepen the molecular understanding of ER-phagy."	0
"30527661"	"Maelstrom Represses Canonical Polymerase II Transcription within Bi-directional piRNA Clusters in Drosophila melanogaster.In Drosophila, 23-30 nt long PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) direct the protein Piwi to silence germline transposon transcription. Most germline piRNAs derive from dual-strand piRNA clusters, heterochromatic transposon graveyards that are transcribed from both genomic strands. These piRNA sources are marked by the heterochromatin protein 1 homolog Rhino (Rhi), which facilitates their promoter-independent transcription, suppresses splicing, and inhibits transcriptional termination. Here, we report that the protein Maelstrom (Mael) represses canonical, promoter-dependent transcription in dual-strand clusters, allowing Rhi to initiate piRNA precursor transcription. Mael also represses promoter-dependent transcription at sites outside clusters. At some loci, Mael repression requires the piRNA pathway, while at others, piRNAs play no role. We propose that by repressing canonical transcription of individual transposon mRNAs, Mael helps Rhi drive non-canonical transcription of piRNA precursors without generating mRNAs encoding transposon proteins."	0
"32187555"	"Cancer Cells Resist Mechanical Destruction in Circulation via RhoA/Actomyosin-Dependent Mechano-Adaptation.During metastasis, cancer cells are exposed to potentially destructive hemodynamic forces including fluid shear stress (FSS) while en route to distant sites. However, prior work indicates that cancer cells are more resistant to brief pulses of high-level FSS in vitro relative to non-transformed epithelial cells. Herein, we identify a mechano-adaptive mechanism of FSS resistance in cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that cancer cells activate RhoA in response to FSS, which protects them from FSS-induced plasma membrane damage. We show that cancer cells freshly isolated from mouse and human tumors are resistant to FSS, that formin and myosin II activity protects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from destruction, and that short-term inhibition of myosin II delays metastasis in mouse models. Collectively, our data indicate that viable CTCs actively resist destruction by hemodynamic forces and are likely to be more mechanically robust than is commonly thought."	0
"31350119"	"Hijacking the Hijackers: Escherichia coli Pathogenicity Islands Redirect Helper Phage Packaging for Their Own Benefit.Phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) represent a novel and universal class of mobile genetic elements, which have broad impact on bacterial virulence. In spite of their relevance, how the Gram-negative PICIs hijack the phage machinery for their own specific packaging and how they block phage reproduction remains to be determined. Using genetic and structural analyses, we solve the mystery here by showing that the Gram-negative PICIs encode a protein that simultaneously performs these processes. This protein, which we have named Rpp (for redirecting phage packaging), interacts with the phage terminase small subunit, forming a heterocomplex. This complex is unable to recognize the phage DNA, blocking phage packaging, but specifically binds to the PICI genome, promoting PICI packaging. Our studies reveal the mechanism of action that allows PICI dissemination in nature, introducing a new paradigm in the understanding of the biology of pathogenicity islands and therefore of bacterial pathogen evolution."	0

Here, we develop selective 40S footprinting to visualize initiating 40S ribosomes on endogenous mRNAs in vivo. This reveals the positions on mRNAs where initiation factors join the ribosome to act and where they leave. We discover that in most human cells, most scanning ribosomes remain attached to the 5' cap. Consequently, only one ribosome scans a 5' UTR at a time, and 5' UTR length affects translation efficiency. We discover that eukaryotic initiation factor 3B (eIF3B,) eIF4G1, and eIF4E remain bound to 80S ribosomes as they begin translating, with a decay half-length of ∼12 codons. Hence, ribosomes retain these initiation factors while translating short upstream open reading frames (uORFs), providing an explanation for how ribosomes can reinitiate translation after uORFs in humans. This method will be of use for studying translation initiation mechanisms in vivo."	0
"32846130"	"BIRC2 Expression Impairs Anti-Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy Efficacy.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has led to therapeutic responses in some cancer patients for whom no effective treatment previously existed. ICB acts on T lymphocytes and other immune cells that are inactivated due to checkpoint signals that inhibit their infiltration and function within tumors. But for more than 80% of patients, immunotherapy has not been effective. Here, we demonstrate a cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to ICB mediated by baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2). Knockdown of BIRC2 expression in mouse melanoma or breast cancer cells increases expression of the chemokine CXCL9 and impairs tumor growth by increasing the number of intratumoral activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells. Administration of anti-CXCL9 neutralizing antibody inhibits the recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer cells to BIRC2-deficient tumors. Most importantly, BIRC2 deficiency dramatically increases the sensitivity of mouse melanoma and breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD1 ICB."	1

Cholinergic neurons, which are especially affected in some pathologies, have recently been shown to exhibit HSP mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In Drosophila central neurons, pharmacological blockade of activity induces a homeostatic response mediated by the Drosophila α7 (Dα7) nAChR, which is tuned by a subsequent increase in expression of the voltage-dependent K<sub>v</sub>4/Shal channel. Here, we show that an in vivo reduction of cholinergic signaling induces HSP mediated by Dα7 nAChRs, and this upregulation of Dα7 itself is sufficient to trigger transcriptional activation, mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), of the K<sub>v</sub>4/Shal gene, revealing a receptor-ion channel system coupled for homeostatic tuning in cholinergic neurons."	0

To gain insight into this unique potentiation mechanism, we determined the 2.0-Å crystal structure of human CLCA1 VWA bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The structure reveals the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in a high-affinity ""open"" conformation, engaging in crystal contacts that likely mimic how CLCA1 engages TMEM16A. The CLCA1 VWA contains a disulfide bond between α3 and α4 in close proximity to the MIDAS that is invariant in the CLCA family and unique in VWA structures. Further biophysical studies indicate that CLCA1 VWA is preferably stabilized by Mg<sup>2+</sup> over Ca<sup>2+</sup> and that α6 atypically extends from the VWA core. Finally, an analysis of TMEM16A structures suggests residues likely to mediate interaction with CLCA1 VWA."	0

In this study, we identified leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) as an essential regulator of early hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs. The deletion of LGR4 severely impairs mesoderm development, thereby limiting hematopoietic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, LGR5 is dispensable for hPSC hematopoiesis. The four R-spondin proteins show differential activities and dependencies on LGR4 in hematopoietic differentiation. The deletion of LGR4 almost entirely abolishes the enhancement induced by R-spondin1 and R-spondin3, but not R-spondin2. In addition, ZNRF3 is required for the response of R-spondin1-R-spondin3. At the mechanistic level, LGR4 regulates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling to control hematopoietic differentiation. Together, our results reveal vital roles of LGR4 in hematopoietic development and uncover distinct functions and underlying mechanisms for R-spondins."	1

For ribosome pauses, fundamental issues remain to be addressed, including where ribosomes pause on mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid sequence causes this pause, and the physiological significance of this attenuation of protein synthesis. Here, we survey the positions of ribosome collisions caused by ribosome pauses in humans and zebrafish using modified ribosome profiling. Collided ribosomes, i.e., disomes, emerge at various sites: Pro-Pro/Gly/Asp motifs; Arg-X-Lys motifs; stop codons; and 3' untranslated regions. The electrostatic interaction between the charged nascent chain and the ribosome exit tunnel determines the eIF5A-mediated disome rescue at the Pro-Pro sites. In particular, XBP1u, a precursor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-responsive transcription factor, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes and thus acts as a degradation substrate by ribosome-associated quality control. Our results provide insight into the causes and consequences of ribosome pause by dissecting collided ribosomes."	0

"32579920"	"Hunger Potentiates the Habenular Winner Pathway for Social Conflict by Orexin-Promoted Biased Alternative Splicing of the AMPA Receptor Gene.Many animals fight for dominance between conspecifics. Because winners could obtain more resources than losers, fighting outcomes are important for the animal's survival, especially in a situation with insufficient resources, such as hunger. However, it remains unclear whether and how hunger affects fighting outcomes. Herein, we investigate the effects of food deprivation on brain activity and fighting behaviors in zebrafish. We report that starvation induces winning in social conflicts. Before the fights, starved fish show potentiation of the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula (dHbL)-dorsal/intermediate interpeduncular nucleus (d/iIPN) pathway, which is known to be essential for and potentiated after winning fights. Circuit potentiation is mediated by hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neuropeptides, which prolong AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) activity by increasing the expression of a flip type of alternative splicing variant of the AMPAR subunit. This mechanism may underlie how hungry vertebrates win fights and may be commonly shared across animal phylogeny."	0
"32839548"	"Cell-cell adhesion and 3D matrix confinement determine jamming transitions in breast cancer invasion.Plasticity of cancer invasion and metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells to switch between collective and single-cell dissemination, controlled by cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions. In clinical samples, E-cadherin-expressing and -deficient tumours both invade collectively and metastasize equally, implicating additional mechanisms controlling cell-cell cooperation and individualization. Here, using spatially defined organotypic culture, intravital microscopy of mammary tumours in mice and in silico modelling, we identify cell density regulation by three-dimensional tissue boundaries to physically control collective movement irrespective of the composition and stability of cell-cell junctions. Deregulation of adherens junctions by downregulation of E-cadherin and p120-catenin resulted in a transition from coordinated to uncoordinated collective movement along extracellular boundaries, whereas single-cell escape depended on locally free tissue space. These results indicate that cadherins and extracellular matrix confinement cooperate to determine unjamming transitions and stepwise epithelial fluidization towards, ultimately, cell individualization."	0

We demonstrate that adaptive immune cells contribute to the different tumor susceptibilities associated with the two microbial communities. Mice that develop more tumors have increased colon lamina propria CD8<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells before tumorigenesis but reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumors and adjacent tissues compared with mice that develop fewer tumors.

Here, we show that SLFN11 increases chromatin accessibility genome wide, prominently at active promoters in response to replication stress induced by the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor prexasertib or the topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin. Concomitantly, SLFN11 selectively activates cellular stress response pathways by inducing the transcription of the immediate early genes (IEGs), including JUN, FOS, EGR1, NFKB2, and ATF3, together with the cell cycle arrest genes CDKN1A (p21<sup>WAF1</sup>) and GADD45. Both chromatin remodeling and IEG activation require the putative ATPase and helicase activity of SLFN11, whereas canonical extrinsic IEG activation is SLFN11 independent. SLFN11-dependent IEG activation by camptothecin is also observed across 55 non-isogenic NCI-60 cell lines. We conclude that SLFN11 acts as a global regulator of chromatin structure and an intrinsic IEG activator with the potential to engage the innate immune activation in response to replicative stress."	0

However, how the two chaperone machineries affect p53 conformation and regulate its function remains elusive. We found that Hsp70, together with Hsp40, unfolds p53 in an ATP-dependent reaction. This unfolded state of p53 is susceptible to aggregation after release induced by the nucleotide exchange factor Bag-1. However, when Hsp90 and the adaptor protein Hop are present, p53 is transferred from Hsp70 to Hsp90, allowing restoration of the native state upon ATP hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the p53 conformation is constantly remodeled by the two major chaperone machineries. This connects p53 activity to stress, and the levels of free molecular chaperones are important factors regulating p53 activity. Together, our findings reveal an intricate interplay and cooperation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in regulating the conformation of a client."	1

We tested this hypothesis in awake macaques and recorded visual motion-direction tuning functions of single PFC neurons. Using micro-iontophoretic drug application combined with single-unit recordings, we simulated receptor-specific dopaminergic input to the PFC and explored cellular gating mechanisms. We find that stimulating D1Rs, and particularly D2Rs, enhances the single-neuron and population coding quality in PFC neurons. D2R stimulation causes a clear increase of the neurons' responses to the preferred motion direction and a decrease to the non-preferred motion direction, thus enhancing neuronal signal-to-noise ratio. Neither D1R nor D2R stimulation had any impact on the neurons' tuning sharpness.

Here, we analyze enhancer configurations in tissues isolated from the common marmoset, a widely used primate model for human disease. Integrating these data with human and mouse data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive B-compartments.

Furthermore, our data provide insight into which trait variations in enhancers can be faithfully modeled using the common marmoset."	0
"31003867"	"REC114 Partner ANKRD31 Controls Number, Timing, and Location of Meiotic DNA Breaks.Double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate the homologous recombination that is crucial for meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation. Here, we unveil mouse ANKRD31 as a lynchpin governing multiple aspects of DSB formation. Spermatocytes lacking ANKRD31 have altered DSB locations and fail to target DSBs to the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of sex chromosomes. They also have delayed and/or fewer recombination sites but, paradoxically, more DSBs, suggesting DSB dysregulation. Unrepaired DSBs and pairing failures-stochastic on autosomes, nearly absolute on X and Y-cause meiotic arrest and sterility in males. Ankrd31-deficient females have reduced oocyte reserves. A crystal structure defines a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in REC114 and its direct intermolecular contacts with ANKRD31. In vivo, ANKRD31 stabilizes REC114 association with the PAR and elsewhere. Our findings inform a model in which ANKRD31 is a scaffold anchoring REC114 and other factors to specific genomic locations, thereby regulating DSB formation."	0
"32589964"	"Selective Translation Complex Profiling Reveals Staged Initiation and Co-translational Assembly of Initiation Factor Complexes.Translational control targeting the initiation phase is central to the regulation of gene expression. Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological advancements. Here we modified yeast translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adapted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ss) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ss), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ss distribute similarly across 5'TRs, indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed yeast and human selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq), enabling selection of 40Ss and 80Ss associated with immuno-targeted factors. Sel-TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5' UTRs with scanning 40Ss to successively dissociate upon AUG recognition; notably, a proportion of eIF3 lingers on during the initial elongation cycles. Highlighting Sel-TCP-seq versatility, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes."	0

Here, we report that the Bacillus subtilis probiotic strain PXN21 inhibits α-synuclein aggregation and clears preformed aggregates in an established Caenorhabditis elegans model of synucleinopathy. This protection is seen in young and aging animals and is partly mediated by DAF-16. Multiple B. subtilis strains trigger the protective effect via both spores and vegetative cells, partly due to a biofilm formation in the gut of the worms and the release of bacterial metabolites. We identify several host metabolic pathways differentially regulated in response to probiotic exposure, including sphingolipid metabolism. We further demonstrate functional roles of the sphingolipid metabolism genes lagr-1, asm-3, and sptl-3 in the anti-aggregation effect. Our findings provide a basis for exploring the disease-modifying potential of B. subtilis as a dietary supplement."	0

Here we reveal that DA inhibited TLR2-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation via the DRD5 receptor in macrophages. We found that the DRD5 receptor, via the EFD and IYX(X)I/L motifs in its CT and IC3 loop, respectively, can directly recruit TRAF6 and its negative regulator ARRB2 to form a multi-protein complex also containing downstream signaling proteins, such as TAK1, IKKs, and PP2A, that impairs TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-κB and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the DA-DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A signaling axis can prevent S. aureus-induced inflammation and protect mice against S. aureus-induced sepsis and meningitis after DA treatment. Collectively, these findings provide the first demonstration of DA-DRD5 signaling acting to control inflammation and a detailed delineation of the underlying mechanism and identify the DRD5-ARRB2-PP2A axis as a potential target for future therapy of inflammation-associated diseases such as meningitis and sepsis."	1
"32492418"	"Regional Variation in Epidermal Susceptibility to UV-Induced Carcinogenesis Reflects Proliferative Activity of Epidermal Progenitors.To better understand the influence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on the initial steps of skin carcinogenesis, we examine patches of labeled keratinocytes as a proxy for clones in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and measure their size variation upon UVB irradiation. Multicolor lineage tracing reveals that in chronically irradiated skin, patches near hair follicles (HFs) increase in size, whereas those far from follicles do not change. This is explained by proliferation of basal epidermal cells within 60 μm of HF openings. Upon interruption of UVB, patch size near HFs regresses significantly. These anatomical differences in proliferative behavior have significant consequences for the cell of origin of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Indeed, a UV-inducible murine BCC model shows that BCC patches are more frequent, larger, and more invasive near HFs. These findings have major implications for the prevention of field cancerization in the epidermis."	0
"31056445"	"Maintenance of CTCF- and Transcription Factor-Mediated Interactions from the Gametes to the Early Mouse Embryo.The epigenetic information present in mammalian gametes and whether it is transmitted to the progeny are relatively unknown. We find that many promoters in mouse sperm are occupied by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and Mediator. The same promoters are accessible in GV and MII oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Sperm distal ATAC-seq sites containing motifs for various transcription factors are conserved in monkeys and humans. ChIP-seq analyses confirm that Foxa1, ERα, and AR occupy distal enhancers in sperm. Accessible sperm enhancers containing H3.3 and H2A.Z are also accessible in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, their interactions with promoters in the gametes persist during early development. Sperm- or oocyte-specific interactions mediated by CTCF and cohesin are only present in the paternal or maternal chromosomes, respectively, in the zygote and 2-cell stages. These interactions converge in both chromosomes by the 8-cell stage. Thus, mammalian gametes contain complex patterns of 3D interactions that can be transmitted to the zygote after fertilization."	0
"32877669"	"Lactate Dehydrogenase A Governs Cardiac Hypertrophic Growth in Response to Hemodynamic Stress.The heart manifests hypertrophic growth in response to high blood pressure, which may decompensate and progress to heart failure under persistent stress. Metabolic remodeling is an early event in this process. However, its role remains to be fully characterized. Here, we show that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a critical glycolytic enzyme, is elevated in the heart in response to hemodynamic stress. Cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of LDHA leads to defective cardiac hypertrophic growth and heart failure by pressure overload. Silencing of LDHA in cultured cardiomyocytes suppresses cell growth from pro-hypertrophic stimulation in vitro, while overexpression of LDHA is sufficient to drive cardiomyocyte growth. Furthermore, we find that lactate is capable of rescuing the growth defect from LDHA knockdown. Mechanistically, lactate stabilizes NDRG3 (N-myc downregulated gene family 3) and stimulates ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Our results together suggest that the LDHA/NDRG3 axis may play a critical role in adaptive cardiomyocyte growth in response to hemodynamic stress."	0
"31968264"	"Transcriptional Programming of Human Mechanosensory Neuron Subtypes from Pluripotent Stem Cells.Efficient and homogeneous in vitro generation of peripheral sensory neurons may provide a framework for novel drug screening platforms and disease models of touch and pain. We discover that, by overexpressing NGN2 and BRN3A, human pluripotent stem cells can be transcriptionally programmed to differentiate into a surprisingly uniform culture of cold- and mechano-sensing neurons. Although such a neuronal subtype is not found in mice, we identify molecular evidence for its existence in human sensory ganglia. Combining NGN2 and BRN3A programming with neural crest patterning, we produce two additional populations of sensory neurons, including a specialized touch receptor neuron subtype. Finally, we apply this system to model a rare inherited sensory disorder of touch and proprioception caused by inactivating mutations in PIEZO2. Together, these findings establish an approach to specify distinct sensory neuron subtypes in vitro, underscoring the utility of stem cell technology to capture human-specific features of physiology and disease."	0
"32503840"	"Characterization of SETD3 methyltransferase-mediated protein methionine methylation.Most characterized protein methylation events encompass arginine and lysine <i>N</i>-methylation, and only a few cases of protein methionine thiomethylation have been reported. Newly discovered oncohistone mutations include lysine-to-methionine substitutions at positions 27 and 36 of histone H3.3. In these instances, the methionine substitution localizes to the active-site pocket of the corresponding histone lysine methyltransferase, thereby inhibiting the respective transmethylation activity. SET domain-containing 3 (SETD3) is a protein (<i>i.e.</i> actin) histidine methyltransferase. Here, we generated an actin variant in which the histidine target of SETD3 was substituted with methionine. As for previously characterized histone SET domain proteins, the methionine substitution substantially (76-fold) increased binding affinity for SETD3 and inhibited SETD3 activity on histidine. Unexpectedly, SETD3 was active on the substituted methionine, generating <i>S</i>-methylmethionine in the context of actin peptide. The ternary structure of SETD3 in complex with the methionine-containing actin peptide at 1.9 Å resolution revealed that the hydrophobic thioether side chain is packed by the aromatic rings of Tyr<sup>312</sup> and Trp<sup>273</sup>, as well as the hydrocarbon side chain of Ile<sup>310</sup> Our results suggest that placing methionine properly in the active site-within close proximity to and in line with the incoming methyl group of SAM-would allow some SET domain proteins to selectively methylate methionine in proteins."	0
"32268101"	"Dysfunction of Persisting β Cells Is a Key Feature of Early Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.Type 2 diabetes is characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and insufficient insulin release from pancreatic islet β cells. However, the role and sequence of β cell dysfunction and mass loss for reduced insulin levels in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis are unclear. Here, we exploit freshly explanted pancreas specimens from metabolically phenotyped surgical patients using an in situ tissue slice technology. This approach allows assessment of β cell volume and function within pancreas samples of metabolically stratified individuals. We show that, in tissue of pre-diabetic, impaired glucose-tolerant subjects, β cell volume is unchanged, but function significantly deteriorates, exhibiting increased basal release and loss of first-phase insulin secretion. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, function within the sustained β cell volume further declines. These results indicate that dysfunction of persisting β cells is a key factor in the early development and progression of type 2 diabetes, representing a major target for diabetes prevention and therapy."	0
"32905773"	"Malic Enzyme Couples Mitochondria with Aerobic Glycolysis in Osteoblasts.The metabolic program of osteoblasts, the chief bone-making cells, remains incompletely understood. Here in murine calvarial cells, we establish that osteoblast differentiation under aerobic conditions is coupled with a marked increase in glucose consumption and lactate production but reduced oxygen consumption. As a result, aerobic glycolysis accounts for approximately 80% of the ATP production in mature osteoblasts. In vivo tracing with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose in the mouse shows that glucose in bone is readily metabolized to lactate but not organic acids in the TCA cycle. Glucose tracing in osteoblast cultures reveals that pyruvate is carboxylated to form malate integral to the malate-aspartate shuttle. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identifies Me2, encoding the mitochondrial NAD-dependent isoform of malic enzyme, as being specifically upregulated during osteoblast differentiation. Knockdown of Me2 markedly reduces the glycolytic flux and impairs osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Thus, the mitochondrial malic enzyme functionally couples the mitochondria with aerobic glycolysis in osteoblasts."	0

We discover 30 brain coexpression modules from seven regions as the major source of AD transcriptional perturbations. We next examine overlap with 251 brain differentially expressed gene sets from mouse models of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Human-mouse overlaps highlight responses to amyloid versus tau pathology and reveal age- and sex-dependent expression signatures for disease progression. Human coexpression modules enriched for neuronal and/or microglial genes broadly overlap with mouse models of AD, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and aging. Other human coexpression modules, including those implicated in proteostasis, are not activated in AD models but rather following other, unexpected genetic manipulations. Our results comprise a cross-species resource, highlighting transcriptional networks altered by human brain pathophysiology and identifying correspondences with mouse models for AD preclinical studies."	0
"32234485"	"Endogenous Retroviral Envelope Syncytin Induces HIV-1 Spreading and Establishes HIV Reservoirs in Placenta.Radical cure of HIV-1 (HIV) is hampered by the establishment of HIV reservoirs and persistent infection in deep tissues despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we show that among HIV-positive women receiving suppressive ART, cells from placental tissues including trophoblasts contain HIV RNA and DNA. These viruses can be reactivated by latency reversal agents. We find that syncytin, the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus family W1 expressed on placental trophoblasts, triggers cell fusion with HIV-infected T cells. This results in cell-to-cell spread of HIV to placental trophoblasts. Such cell-to-cell spread of HIV is less sensitive to ART than free virus. Replication in syncytin-expressing cells can also produce syncytin-pseudotyped HIV, further expanding its ability to infect non-CD4 cells. These previously unrecognized mechanisms of HIV entry enable the virus to bypass receptor restriction to infect host barrier cells, thereby facilitating viral transmission and persistent infection in deep tissues."	0
"32313104"	"Overcoming Wnt-β-catenin dependent anticancer therapy resistance in leukaemia stem cells.Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) underlie cancer therapy resistance but targeting these cells remains difficult. The Wnt-β-catenin and PI3K-Akt pathways cooperate to promote tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. In a mouse model in which both pathways are activated in stem and progenitor cells, LSCs expanded under chemotherapy-induced stress. Since Akt can activate β-catenin, inhibiting this interaction might target therapy-resistant LSCs. High-throughput screening identified doxorubicin (DXR) as an inhibitor of the Akt-β-catenin interaction at low doses. Here we repurposed DXR as a targeted inhibitor rather than a broadly cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted DXR reduced Akt-activated β-catenin levels in chemoresistant LSCs and reduced LSC tumorigenic activity. Mechanistically, β-catenin binds multiple immune-checkpoint gene loci, and targeted DXR treatment inhibited expression of multiple immune checkpoints specifically in LSCs, including PD-L1, TIM3 and CD24. Overall, LSCs exhibit distinct properties of immune resistance that are reduced by inhibiting Akt-activated β-catenin. These findings suggest a strategy for overcoming cancer therapy resistance and immune escape."	0
"32726629"	"Dysregulation of the Synaptic Cytoskeleton in the PFC Drives Neural Circuit Pathology, Leading to Social Dysfunction.Psychiatric disorders are highly heritable pathologies of altered neural circuit functioning. How genetic mutations lead to specific neural circuit abnormalities underlying behavioral disruptions, however, remains unclear. Using circuit-selective transgenic tools and a mouse model of maladaptive social behavior (ArpC3 mutant), we identify a neural circuit mechanism driving dysfunctional social behavior. We demonstrate that circuit-selective knockout (ctKO) of the ArpC3 gene within prefrontal cortical neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala elevates the excitability of the circuit neurons, leading to disruption of socially evoked neural activity and resulting in abnormal social behavior. Optogenetic activation of this circuit in wild-type mice recapitulates the social dysfunction observed in ArpC3 mutant mice. Finally, the maladaptive sociability of ctKO mice is rescued by optogenetically silencing neurons within this circuit. These results highlight a mechanism of how a gene-to-neural circuit interaction drives altered social behavior, a common phenotype of several psychiatric disorders."	0
"32004469"	"Toward a Structural Understanding of Class B GPCR Peptide Binding and Activation.Class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets for major diseases. Here, we present structures of peptide and Gs-bound pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, PAC1 receptor, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), (CRF1) receptor. Together with recently solved structures, these provide coverage of the major class B GPCR subfamilies. Diverse orientations of the extracellular domain to the receptor core in different receptors are at least partially dependent on evolutionary conservation in the structure and nature of peptide interactions. Differences in peptide interactions to the receptor core also influence the interlinked TM2-TM1-TM6/ECL3/TM7 domain, and this is likely important in their diverse signaling. However, common conformational reorganization of ECL2, linked to reorganization of ICL2, modulates G protein contacts. Comparison between receptors reveals ICL2 as a key domain forming dynamic G protein interactions in a receptor- and ligand-specific manner. This work advances our understanding of class B GPCR activation and Gs coupling."	0
"32679077"	"Acetylation-Dependent Deubiquitinase OTUD3 Controls MAVS Activation in Innate Antiviral Immunity.Accurate regulation of innate immunity is necessary for the host to efficiently respond to invading pathogens and avoid excessive harmful immune pathology. Here we identified OTUD3 as an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinase that restricts innate antiviral immune signaling. OTUD3 deficiency in mice results in enhanced innate immunity, a diminished viral load, and morbidity. OTUD3 directly hydrolyzes lysine 63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and thus shuts off innate antiviral immune response. Notably, the catalytic activity of OTUD3 relies on acetylation of its Lys129 residue. In response to virus infection, the acetylated Lys129 is removed by SIRT1, which promptly inactivates OTUD3 and thus allows timely induction of innate antiviral immunity. Importantly, acetyl-OTUD3 levels are inversely correlated with IFN-β expression in influenza patients. These findings establish OTUD3 as a repressor of MAVS and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the catalytic activity of OTUD3 is tightly controlled to ensure timely activation of antiviral defense."	1
"32579919"	"Epigenomically Bistable Regions across Neuron-Specific Genes Govern Neuron Eligibility to a Coding Ensemble in the Hippocampus.Sensory inputs activate sparse neuronal ensembles in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but how eligibility of individual neurons to recruitment is determined remains elusive. We identify thousands of largely bistable (CpG methylated or unmethylated) regions within neuronal gene bodies, established during mouse dentate gyrus development. Reducing DNA methylation and the proportion of the methylated epialleles at bistable regions compromises novel context-induced neuronal activation. Conversely, increasing methylation and the frequency of the methylated epialleles at bistable regions enhances intrinsic excitability. Single-nucleus profiling reveals enrichment of specific epialleles related to a subset of primarily exonic, bistable regions in activated neurons. Genes displaying both differential methylation and expression in activated neurons define a network of proteins regulating neuronal excitability and structural plasticity. We propose a model in which bistable regions create neuron heterogeneity and constellations of exonic methylation, which may contribute to cell-specific gene expression, excitability, and eligibility to a coding ensemble."	0
"31000436"	"Mouse ANKRD31 Regulates Spatiotemporal Patterning of Meiotic Recombination Initiation and Ensures Recombination between X and Y Sex Chromosomes.Orderly segregation of chromosomes during meiosis requires that crossovers form between homologous chromosomes by recombination. Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate meiotic recombination. We identify ANKRD31 as a key component of complexes of DSB-promoting proteins that assemble on meiotic chromosome axes. Genome-wide, ANKRD31 deficiency causes delayed recombination initiation. In addition, loss of ANKRD31 alters DSB distribution because of reduced selectivity for sites that normally attract DSBs. Strikingly, ANKRD31 deficiency also abolishes uniquely high rates of recombination that normally characterize pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of X and Y chromosomes. Consequently, sex chromosomes do not form crossovers, leading to chromosome segregation failure in ANKRD31-deficient spermatocytes. These defects co-occur with a genome-wide delay in assembling DSB-promoting proteins on autosome axes and loss of a specialized PAR-axis domain that is highly enriched for DSB-promoting proteins in wild type. Thus, we propose a model for spatiotemporal patterning of recombination by ANKRD31-dependent control of axis-associated DSB-promoting proteins."	0

Although components used to build these complexes have been well defined, we still have only a limited understanding of the structure of the Sin3/HDAC subunits assembled around the scaffolding protein SIN3A. To characterize the spatial arrangement of Sin3 subunits, we combined Halo affinity capture, chemical crosslinking, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to determine intersubunit distance constraints, identifying 66 interprotein and 63 self-crosslinks for 13 Sin3 subunits. Having assessed crosslink authenticity by mapping self-crosslinks onto existing structures, we used distance restraints from interprotein crosslinks to guide assembly of a Sin3 complex substructure. We identified the relative positions of subunits SAP30L, HDAC1, SUDS3, HDAC2, and ING1 around the SIN3A scaffold. The architecture of this subassembly suggests that multiple factors have space to assemble to collectively influence the behavior of the catalytic subunit HDAC1."	0
"32579922"	"Sex Differences in Gene Expression and Regulatory Networks across 29 Human Tissues.Sex differences manifest in many diseases and may drive sex-specific therapeutic responses. To understand the molecular basis of sex differences, we evaluated sex-biased gene regulation by constructing sample-specific gene regulatory networks in 29 human healthy tissues using 8,279 whole-genome expression profiles from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We find sex-biased regulatory network structures in each tissue. Even though most transcription factors (TFs) are not differentially expressed between males and females, many have sex-biased regulatory targeting patterns. In each tissue, genes that are differentially targeted by TFs between the sexes are enriched for tissue-related functions and diseases. In brain tissue, for example, genes associated with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are targeted by different sets of TFs in each sex. Our systems-based analysis identifies a repertoire of TFs that play important roles in sex-specific architecture of gene regulatory networks, and it underlines sex-specific regulatory processes in both health and disease."	0
"30956043"	"A Combined Approach Reveals a Regulatory Mechanism Coupling Src's Kinase Activity, Localization, and Phosphotransferase-Independent Functions.Multiple layers of regulation modulate the activity and localization of protein kinases. However, many details of kinase regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we apply saturation mutagenesis and a chemical genetic method for allosterically modulating kinase global conformation to Src kinase, providing insight into known regulatory mechanisms and revealing a previously undiscovered interaction between Src's SH4 and catalytic domains. Abrogation of this interaction increased phosphotransferase activity, promoted membrane association, and provoked phosphotransferase-independent alterations in cell morphology. Thus, Src's SH4 domain serves as an intramolecular regulator coupling catalytic activity, global conformation, and localization, as well as mediating a phosphotransferase-independent function. Sequence conservation suggests that the SH4 domain regulatory interaction exists in other Src-family kinases. Our combined approach's ability to reveal a regulatory mechanism in one of the best-studied kinases suggests that it could be applied broadly to provide insight into kinase structure, regulation, and function."	0

"32554467"	"The RAS-interacting chaperone UNC119 drives the RASSF6-MDM2-p53 axis and antagonizes RAS-mediated malignant transformation.The gene encoding the proto-oncogene GTPase RAS is frequently mutated in human cancers. Mutated RAS proteins trigger antiapoptotic and cell-proliferative signals and lead to oncogenesis. However, RAS also induces apoptosis and senescence, which may contribute to the eradication of cells with RAS mutations. We previously reported that Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6) binds MDM2 and stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and that the active form of KRAS promotes the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2. We also reported that Unc-119 lipid-binding chaperone (UNC119A), a chaperone of myristoylated proteins, interacts with RASSF6 and regulates RASSF6-mediated apoptosis. In this study, using several human cancer cell lines, quantitative RT-PCR, RNAi-based gene silencing, and immunoprecipitation/-fluorescence and cell biology assays, we report that UNC119A interacts with the active form of KRAS and that the C-terminal modification of KRAS is required for this interaction. We also noted that the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119A, which binds the myristoylated peptides, is not involved in the interaction. We observed that UNC119A promotes the binding of KRAS to RASSF6, enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2, and induces apoptosis. Conversely, <i>UNC119A</i> silencing promoted soft-agar colony formation, migration, and invasiveness in KRAS-mutated cancer cells. We conclude that UNC119A promotes KRAS-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis via RASSF6 and may play a tumor-suppressive role in cells with KRAS mutations."	1
"32471866"	"Engineered anti-inflammatory peptides inspired by mapping an evasin-chemokine interaction.Chemokines mediate leukocyte migration and homeostasis and are key targets in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, cytokine storm, and chronic autoimmune disease. Chemokine redundancy and ensuing network robustness has frustrated therapeutic development. Salivary evasins from ticks bind multiple chemokines to overcome redundancy and are effective in several preclinical disease models. Their clinical development has not progressed because of concerns regarding potential immunogenicity, parenteral delivery, and cost. Peptides mimicking protein activity can overcome the perceived limitations of therapeutic proteins. Here we show that peptides possessing multiple chemokine-binding and anti-inflammatory activities can be developed from the chemokine-binding site of an evasin. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS to map the binding interface of the evasin P672 that physically interacts with C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 8 and synthesized a 16-mer peptide (BK1.1) based on this interface region in evasin P672. Fluorescent polarization and native MS approaches showed that BK1.1 binds CCL8, CCL7, and CCL18 and disrupts CCL8 homodimerization. We show that a BK1.1 derivative, BK1.3, has substantially improved ability to disrupt P672 binding to CCL8, CCL2, and CCL3 in an AlphaScreen assay. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that BK1.3 directly binds CCL8. BK1.3 also has substantially improved ability to inhibit CCL8, CCL7, CCL2, and CCL3 chemotactic function <i>in vitro</i> We show that local as well as systemic administration of BK1.3 potently blocks inflammation <i>in vivo</i> Identification and characterization of the chemokine-binding interface of evasins could thus inspire the development of novel anti-inflammatory peptides that therapeutically target the chemokine network in inflammatory diseases."	0

We report that genetically clonal induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an AML patient and characterized by exceptionally high engraftment potential give rise, upon hematopoietic differentiation, to a phenotypic hierarchy. Through fate-tracking experiments, xenotransplantation, and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify a cell fraction (iLSC) that can be isolated prospectively by means of adherent in vitro growth that resides on the apex of this hierarchy and fulfills the hallmark features of LSCs.

In contrast to oncogenic kinases, whose function is acutely regulated by transient phosphorylation, PKC is constitutively phosphorylated following biosynthesis to yield a stable, autoinhibited enzyme that is reversibly activated by second messengers. Here, we report that the phosphatase PHLPP1 opposes PKC phosphorylation during maturation, leading to the degradation of aberrantly active species that do not become autoinhibited. Cancer-associated hotspot mutations in the pseudosubstrate of PKCβ that impair autoinhibition result in dephosphorylated and unstable enzymes. Protein-level analysis reveals that PKCα is fully phosphorylated at the PHLPP site in over 5,000 patient tumors, with higher PKC levels correlating (1) inversely with PHLPP1 levels and (2) positively with improved survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Thus, PHLPP1 provides a proofreading step that maintains the fidelity of PKC autoinhibition and reveals a prominent loss-of-function mechanism in cancer by suppressing the steady-state levels of PKC."	1

Our strategy detects ∼3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation undetected by other methods. We discover a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth, which we validate from newly analyzed independent samples (n = 100). Further validating these identified genes via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis.

"32636304"	"The barley lectin, horcolin, binds high-mannose glycans in a multivalent fashion, enabling high-affinity, specific inhibition of cellular HIV infection.<i>N</i>-Linked glycans are critical to the infection cycle of HIV, and most neutralizing antibodies target the high-mannose glycans found on the surface envelope glycoprotein-120 (gp120). Carbohydrate-binding proteins, particularly mannose-binding lectins, have also been shown to bind these glycans. Despite their therapeutic potency, their ability to cause lymphocyte proliferation limits their application. In this study, we report one such lectin named horcolin (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> lectin), seen to lack mitogenicity owing to the divergence in the residues at its carbohydrate-binding sites, which makes it a promising candidate for exploration as an anti-HIV agent. Extensive isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that the lectin was sensitive to the length and branching of mannooligosaccharides and thereby the total valency. Modeling and simulation studies demonstrate two distinct modes of binding, a monovalent binding to shorter saccharides and a bivalent mode for higher glycans, involving simultaneous interactions of multiple glycan arms with the primary carbohydrate-binding sites. This multivalent mode of binding was further strengthened by interactions of core mannosyl residues with a secondary conserved site on the protein, leading to an exponential increase in affinity. Finally, we confirmed the interaction of horcolin with recombinant gp120 and gp140 with high affinity and inhibition of HIV infection at nanomolar concentrations without mitogenicity."	0
"32049030"	"Transcriptional Signatures of Tau and Amyloid Neuropathology.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and the accumulation of β-amyloid in the neocortex. We use transgenic mice harboring human tau (rTg4510) and amyloid precursor protein (J20) mutations to investigate transcriptional changes associated with the progression of tau and amyloid pathology. rTg4510 mice are characterized by widespread transcriptional differences in the entorhinal cortex with changes paralleling neuropathological burden across multiple brain regions. Differentially expressed transcripts overlap with genes identified in genetic studies of familial and sporadic AD. Systems-level analyses identify discrete co-expression networks associated with the progressive accumulation of tau that are enriched for genes and pathways previously implicated in AD pathology and overlap with co-expression networks identified in human AD cortex. Our data provide further evidence for an immune-response component in the accumulation of tau and reveal molecular pathways associated with the progression of AD neuropathology."	0

"31101499"	"Targeted and Persistent 8-Oxoguanine Base Damage at Telomeres Promotes Telomere Loss and Crisis.Telomeres are essential for genome stability. Oxidative stress caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accelerates telomere shortening. Although telomeres are hypersensitive to ROS-mediated 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation, the biological effect of this common lesion at telomeres is poorly understood because ROS have pleiotropic effects. Here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that selectively produces 8-oxoG only at telomeres. Acute telomeric 8-oxoG formation increased telomere fragility in cells lacking OGG1, the enzyme that removes 8-oxoG, but did not compromise cell survival. However, chronic telomeric 8-oxoG induction over time shortens telomeres and impairs cell growth. Accumulation of telomeric 8-oxoG in chronically exposed OGG1-deficient cells triggers replication stress, as evidenced by mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, and significantly increases telomere losses. These losses generate chromosome fusions, leading to chromatin bridges and micronucleus formation upon cell division. By confining base damage to the telomeres, we show that telomeric 8-oxoG accumulation directly drives telomere crisis."	0
"32187550"	"miR-181a Modulation of ERK-MAPK Signaling Sustains DC-SIGN Expression and Limits Activation of Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells.DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) play important roles in bacterial infections and inflammatory diseases, but the factors regulating their differentiation and proinflammatory status remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a microRNA, miR-181a, and a molecular mechanism that simultaneously regulate the acquisition of DC-SIGN expression and the activation state of DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> mo-DCs. Specifically, we show that miR-181a promotes DC-SIGN expression during terminal mo-DC differentiation and limits its sensitivity and responsiveness to TLR triggering and CD40 ligation. Mechanistically, miR-181a sustains ERK-MAPK signaling in mo-DCs, thereby enabling the maintenance of high levels of DC-SIGN and a high activation threshold. Low miR-181a levels during mo-DC differentiation, induced by inflammatory signals, do not support the high phospho-ERK signal transduction required for DC-SIGN<sup>hi</sup> mo-DCs and lead to development of proinflammatory DC-SIGN<sup>lo/-</sup> mo-DCs. Collectively, our study demonstrates that high DC-SIGN expression levels and a high activation threshold in mo-DCs are linked and simultaneously maintained by miR-181a."	1
"32592681"	"Robust Hi-C Maps of Enhancer-Promoter Interactions Reveal the Function of Non-coding Genome in Neural Development and Diseases.Genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions at high resolution remains experimentally and computationally challenging. Here we used a low-input ""easy Hi-C"" protocol to map the 3D genome architecture in human neurogenesis and brain tissues and also demonstrated that a rigorous Hi-C bias-correction pipeline (HiCorr) can significantly improve the sensitivity and robustness of Hi-C loop identification at sub-TAD level, especially the enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. We used HiCorr to compare the high-resolution maps of chromatin interactions from 10 tissue or cell types with a focus on neurogenesis and brain tissues. We found that dynamic chromatin loops are better hallmarks for cellular differentiation than compartment switching. HiCorr allowed direct observation of cell-type- and differentiation-specific E-P aggregates spanning large neighborhoods, suggesting a mechanism that stabilizes enhancer contacts during development. Interestingly, we concluded that Hi-C loop outperforms eQTL in explaining neurological GWAS results, revealing a unique value of high-resolution 3D genome maps in elucidating the disease etiology."	0
"32531202"	"Tuning Transcription Factor Availability through Acetylation-Mediated Genomic Redistribution.It is widely assumed that decreasing transcription factor DNA-binding affinity reduces transcription initiation by diminishing occupancy of sequence-specific regulatory elements. However, in vivo transcription factors find their binding sites while confronted with a large excess of low-affinity degenerate motifs. Here, using the melanoma lineage survival oncogene MITF as a model, we show that low-affinity binding sites act as a competitive reservoir in vivo from which transcription factors are released by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-stimulated acetylation to promote increased occupancy of their regulatory elements. Consequently, a low-DNA-binding-affinity acetylation-mimetic MITF mutation supports melanocyte development and drives tumorigenesis, whereas a high-affinity non-acetylatable mutant does not. The results reveal a paradoxical acetylation-mediated molecular clutch that tunes transcription factor availability via genome-wide redistribution and couples BRAF to tumorigenesis. Our results further suggest that p300/CREB-binding protein-mediated transcription factor acetylation may represent a common mechanism to control transcription factor availability."	0
"32647010"	"Simplified detection of polyhistidine-tagged proteins in gels and membranes using a UV-excitable dye and a multiple chelator head pair.The polyhistidine tag (His-tag) is one of the most popular protein tags used in the life sciences. Traditionally, the detection of His-tagged proteins relies on immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies. This approach is laborious for certain applications, such as protein purification, where time and simplicity are critical. The His-tag can also be directly detected by metal ion-loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based chelator heads conjugated to fluorophores, which is a convenient alternative method to immunoblotting. Typically, such chelator heads are conjugated to either green or red fluorophores, the detection of which requires specialized excitation sources and detection systems. Here, we demonstrate that post-run staining is ideal for His-tag detection by metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads in PAGE and blot membranes. Additionally, by comparing the performances of different chelator heads, we show how differences in microscopic affinity constants translate to macroscopic differences in the detection limits in environments with limited diffusion, such as PAGE. On the basis of these results, we devise a simple approach, called UVHis-PAGE, that uses metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads to detect His-tagged proteins in PAGE and blot membranes. Our method uses a UV transilluminator as an excitation source, and the results can be visually inspected by the naked eye."	0
"31761494"	"RNA-RNA Interactomes of ProQ and Hfq Reveal Overlapping and Competing Roles.Base pairing RNAs modulate gene expression in all studied organisms. In many bacteria, the base pairing between most small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and their targets is mediated by the Hfq RNA chaperone. However, recent studies have shown FinO-domain proteins also bind sRNAs. To examine the global contribution of the FinO-domain ProQ protein in Escherichia coli, we carried out RIL-seq to identify RNA pairs bound to this protein. The RNA-RNA interactome for ProQ contains hundreds of pairs. Intriguingly, a significant fraction of the ProQ-bound RNA pairs are also found associated with Hfq, indicating overlapping, complementary, or competing roles for the two proteins. Characterization of one novel RNA pair bound by both chaperones revealed that while Hfq is required for RNA sponge-mediated downregulation of the sRNA, ProQ can inhibit this regulation. Overall, our results uncover increased complexity in RNA regulatory networks involving RNA chaperone proteins, RNases, sRNAs, and mRNAs."	0

To speed up such discoveries, we apply state-of-the-art machine learning to delineate currently unknown biological effects of inactive ingredients-focusing on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 (UGT2B7), two proteins that impact the pharmacokinetics of approximately 20% of FDA-approved drugs.

"31879358"	"TRPS1 acts as a context-dependent regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth/differentiation and breast cancer development.The GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor TRPS1 has been implicated in breast cancer. However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications and inactivating mutations in <i>TRPS1</i> have been reported. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary gland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by functional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary epithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling promotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 expression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo survival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, the consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined inactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary organoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results demonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal mammary epithelial cells."	0
"32521267"	"Stem Cell Determinant SOX9 Promotes Lineage Plasticity and Progression in Basal-like Breast Cancer.Lineage plasticity is important for the development of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), an aggressive cancer subtype. While BLBC is likely to originate from luminal progenitor cells, it acquires substantial basal cell features and contains a heterogenous collection of cells exhibiting basal, luminal, and hybrid phenotypes. Why luminal progenitors are prone to BLBC transformation and what drives luminal-to-basal reprogramming remain unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor SOX9 acts as a determinant for estrogen-receptor-negative (ER<sup>-</sup>) luminal stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs). SOX9 controls LSPC activity in part by activating both canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Inactivation of TP53 and RB via expression of SV40 TAg in a BLBC mouse tumor model leads to upregulation of SOX9, which drives luminal-to-basal reprogramming in vivo. Furthermore, SOX9 deletion inhibits the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-like lesions to invasive carcinoma. These data show that ER<sup>-</sup> LSPC determinant SOX9 acts as a lineage plasticity driver for BLBC progression."	0
"31812349"	"Functional Translatome Proteomics Reveal Converging and Dose-Dependent Regulation by mTORC1 and eIF2α.Regulation of translation is essential during stress. However, the precise sets of proteins regulated by the key translational stress responses-the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTORC1-remain elusive. We developed multiplexed enhanced protein dynamics (mePROD) proteomics, adding signal amplification to dynamic-SILAC and multiplexing, to enable measuring acute changes in protein synthesis. Treating cells with ISR/mTORC1-modulating stressors, we showed extensive translatome modulation with ∼20% of proteins synthesized at highly reduced rates. Comparing translation-deficient sub-proteomes revealed an extensive overlap demonstrating that target specificity is achieved on protein level and not by pathway activation. Titrating cap-dependent translation inhibition confirmed that synthesis of individual proteins is controlled by intrinsic properties responding to global translation attenuation. This study reports a highly sensitive method to measure relative translation at the nascent chain level and provides insight into how the ISR and mTORC1, two key cellular pathways, regulate the translatome to guide cellular survival upon stress."	0
"32518153"	"Biological and catalytic functions of sirtuin 6 as targets for small-molecule modulators.Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase of histone H3 that regulates genome stability and gene expression. However, nonhistone substrates and additional catalytic activities of SIRT6, including long-chain deacylation and mono-ADP-ribosylation of other proteins, have also been reported, but many of these noncanonical roles remain enigmatic. Genetic studies have revealed critical homeostatic cellular functions of SIRT6, underscoring the need to better understand which catalytic functions and molecular pathways are driving SIRT6-associated phenotypes. At the physiological level, SIRT6 activity promotes increased longevity by regulating metabolism and DNA repair. Recent work has identified natural products and synthetic small molecules capable of activating the inefficient <i>in vitro</i> deacetylase activity of SIRT6. Here, we discuss the cellular functions of SIRT6 with a focus on attributing its catalytic activity to its proposed biological functions. We cover the molecular architecture and catalytic mechanisms that distinguish SIRT6 from other NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacylases. We propose that combining specific SIRT6 amino acid substitutions identified in enzymology studies and activity-selective compounds could help delineate SIRT6 functions in specific biological contexts and resolve the apparently conflicting roles of SIRT6 in processes such as tumor development. We further highlight the recent development of small-molecule modulators that provide additional biological insight into SIRT6 functions and offer therapeutic approaches to manage metabolic and age-associated diseases."	0
"32640214"	"Mutant p53 Drives Cancer Metastasis via RCP-Mediated Hsp90α Secretion.Mutant p53 (mutp53) loses its tumor suppressor properties but gains oncogenic functions of driving malignancy. However, it remains largely unknown how mutp53 drives cancer metastasis. Here, we show that wild-type p53 (WTp53) suppresses the secretion of heat shock protein 90-alpha (Hsp90α), whereas mutp53 enhances Hsp90α vesicular trafficking and exosome-mediated secretion. Long-term delivery of an antibody that blocks extracellular Hsp90α (eHsp90α) function extends the survival of p53<sup>-/-</sup> mice and attenuates the invasiveness of p53 mutant tumors. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and functional analysis identified a critical role for Rab coupling protein (RCP) in mutp53-induced Hsp90α secretion. RCP knockdown decreases eHsp90α levels and inhibits malignant progression. Notably, recombinant Hsp90α re-introduction markedly rescues the impaired migration and invasion abilities caused by RCP depletion. Taken together, these findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mutp53 executes oncogenic activities via its downstream RCP-mediated Hsp90α secretion and a strategy to treat human cancers expressing mutp53 proteins."	0

However, the molecular mechanisms by which these histone marks function in chromosome compartmentalization are poorly understood.

"30712989"	"ELTA: Enzymatic Labeling of Terminal ADP-Ribose.ADP-ribosylation refers to the addition of one or more ADP-ribose groups onto proteins. The attached ADP-ribose monomers or polymers, commonly known as poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), modulate the activities of the modified substrates or their binding affinities to other proteins. However, progress in this area is hindered by a lack of tools to investigate this protein modification. Here, we describe a new method named ELTA (enzymatic labeling of terminal ADP-ribose) for labeling free or protein-conjugated ADP-ribose monomers and polymers at their 2'-OH termini using the enzyme OAS1 and dATP. When coupled with various dATP analogs (e.g., radioactive, fluorescent, affinity tags), ELTA can be used to explore PAR biology with techniques routinely used to investigate DNA or RNA function. We demonstrate that ELTA enables the biophysical measurements of protein binding to PAR of a defined length, detection of PAR length from proteins and cells, and enrichment of sub-femtomole amounts of ADP-ribosylated peptides from cell lysates."	0

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (hnRNPG) is an m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein that binds RNA through RRM and Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motifs. Here, we show that hnRNPG directly binds to the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) using RGG motifs in its low-complexity region. Through interactions with the phosphorylated CTD and nascent RNA, hnRNPG associates co-transcriptionally with RNAPII and regulates alternative splicing transcriptome-wide. m<sup>6</sup>A near splice sites in nascent pre-mRNA modulates hnRNPG binding, which influences RNAPII occupancy patterns and promotes exon inclusion.

Although some of these genes are controlled by specific transcriptional programs, very little is known about their post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we analyze the expression signature associated with all 687 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and identify 39 that significantly correlate with cell cycle mRNAs. We find that NF45 and NF90 play essential roles in mitosis, and transcriptome analysis reveals that they are necessary for the expression of a subset of mitotic mRNAs. Using proteomics, we identify protein clusters associated with the NF45-NF90 complex, including components of Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). We show that depletion of SMD components increases the binding of mitotic mRNAs to the NF45-NF90 complex and rescues cells from mitotic defects.

The 6-valent vaccine includes gp145 Env DNAs, representing six sequentially isolated Envs from the HIV-infected individual CH505, and matching GLA-SE-adjuvanted gp120 Env proteins. Interestingly, only macaques in the co-administration vaccine group are protected against SHIV CH505 acquisition after repeated low-dose intravaginal challenge and show 67% risk reduction per exposure. Macaques in the co-administration group develop higher Env-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Non-neutralizing Env antibodies, ADCC, and antibodies binding to FcγRIIIa are associated with decreased transmission risk.

The anti-recombinogenic functions of 53BP1 require phosphorylation-dependent interactions with PTIP and RIF1/shieldin effector complexes. While RIF1/shieldin blocks 5'-3' nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, it remains unclear how PTIP antagonizes HR. Here, we show that mutation of the PTIP interaction site in 53BP1 (S25A) allows sufficient DNA2-dependent end resection to rescue the lethality of BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup> mice, despite increasing RIF1 ""end-blocking"" at DNA damage sites. However, double-mutant cells fail to complete HR, as excessive shieldin activity also inhibits RNF168-mediated loading of PALB2/RAD51. As a result, BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup>53BP1<sup>S25A</sup> mice exhibit hallmark features of HR insufficiency, including premature aging and hypersensitivity to PARPi. Disruption of shieldin or forced targeting of PALB2 to ssDNA in BRCA1<sup>D11</sup>53BP1<sup>S25A</sup> cells restores RNF168 recruitment, RAD51 nucleofilament formation, and PARPi resistance.

Thus, AHR is necessary for the proliferation of MYC-overexpressing cells. To define metabolic pathways in which AHR cooperates with MYC in supporting cell growth, here we used LC-MS-based metabolomics to examine the metabolome of MYC-expressing cells upon <i>AHR</i> knockdown. We found that <i>AHR</i> knockdown reduced lactate, S-lactoylglutathione, <i>N</i>-acetyl-l-alanine, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and UMP levels.

Early in development, aRG express high levels of Foxp1 mRNA and protein, which promote self-renewing cell divisions and deep-layer neuron production. Foxp1 levels subsequently decline during the transition to superficial-layer neurogenesis. Sustained Foxp1 expression impedes this transition, preserving a population of cells with aRG identity throughout development and extending the early neurogenic period into postnatal life. FOXP1 expression is further associated with the initial formation and expansion of basal RG (bRG) during human corticogenesis and can promote the formation of cells exhibiting characteristics of bRG when misexpressed in the mouse cortex.

During infection, IL-1β production occurs in parallel with the onset of innate antimicrobial defenses, but the contribution of IL-1β signaling to cell-intrinsic immunity is not defined. Here, we report that exogenous IL-1β induces interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation in human myeloid, fibroblast, and epithelial cells. IRF3 activation by IL-1β is dependent upon the DNA-sensing pathway adaptor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), through the recognition of cytosolic mtDNA by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS). IL-1β treatment results in interferon (IFN) production and activation of IFN signaling to direct a potent innate immune response that restricts dengue virus infection.

"32375053"	"Suppression of Inflammasome Activation by IRF8 and IRF4 in cDCs Is Critical for T Cell Priming.Inflammasome activation leads to pyroptotic cell death, thereby eliminating the replicative niche of virulent pathogens. Although inflammasome-associated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 have an established role in T cell function, whether inflammasome activation in dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for T cell priming is not clear. Here, we find that conventional DCs (cDCs) suppress inflammasome activation to prevent pyroptotic cell death, thus preserving their ability to prime both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Transcription factors IRF8 and IRF4, in cDC1s and cDC2s, respectively, mediate suppression of inflammasome activation by limiting the expression of inflammasome-associated genes. Overexpression of IRF4 or IRF8 inhibits inflammasome activation in macrophages, while reduced expression of IRF8 leads to aberrant inflammasome activation in cDC1s and hampers their ability to prime CD8 T cells. Thus, activation of inflammasome in DCs is detrimental to adaptive immunity, and our results reveal that cDCs use IRF4 and IRF8 to suppress this response."	0

We report that the acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated CBFβ-SMMHC fusion oncoprotein physically interacts with the PRC1 complex and that these factors co-localize across the AML genome in an apparently PRC2-independent manner. Depletion of CBFβ-SMMHC caused substantial increases in genome-wide PRC1 binding and marked changes in the association between PRC1 and the CBF DNA-binding subunit RUNX1. PRC1 was more likely to be associated with actively transcribed genes in CBFβ-SMMHC-expressing cells.

The signaling pathway includes synthesis of cyclic oligo-adenylate (cOA) and activation of the RNase activity of type III accessory ribonuclease Csm6/Csx1 by cOA. After the immune response, cOA should be cleared on time to avoid constant cellular RNA degradation. In this study, we find a metal-dependent cOA degradation activity in Sulfolobus islandicus. The activity is associated with the cell membrane and able to accelerate cOA clearance at a high cOA level. Further, we show that a metal-dependent and membrane-associated DHH-DHHA1 family nuclease (MAD) rapidly cleaves cOA and deactivates Csx1 ribonuclease. The cOA degradation efficiency of MAD is much higher than the cellular ring nuclease. However, the subcellular organization may prevent it from degrading nascent cOA. Together, the data suggest that MAD acts as the second cOA degrader after the ring nuclease to remove diffused redundant cOA."	0
"32611768"	"Direct evidence for a new mode of plant defense against insects via a novel polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein expression strategy.Plant cell wall-associated polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. They play a crucial role in plant defense against phytopathogens by inhibiting microbial polygalacturonases (PGs). PGs hydrolyze the cell wall polysaccharide pectin and are among the first enzymes to be secreted during plant infection. Recent studies demonstrated that herbivorous insects express their own PG multi-gene families, raising the question whether PGIPs also inhibit insect PGs and protect plants from herbivores. Preliminary evidence suggested that PGIPs may negatively influence larval growth of the leaf beetle <i>Phaedon cochleariae</i> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and identified BrPGIP3 from Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinensis</i>) as a candidate. PGIPs are predominantly studied <i>in planta</i> because their heterologous expression in microbial systems is problematic and instability and aggregation of recombinant PGIPs has complicated <i>in vitro</i> inhibition assays. To minimize aggregate formation, we heterologously expressed BrPGIP3 fused to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor, immobilizing it on the extracellular surface of insect cells. We demonstrated that BrPGIP3_GPI inhibited several <i>P. cochleariae</i> PGs <i>in vitro</i>, providing the first direct evidence of an interaction between a plant PGIP and an animal PG. Thus, plant PGIPs not only confer resistance against phytopathogens, but may also aid in defense against herbivorous beetles."	0
"31676232"	"PRIMPOL-Mediated Adaptive Response Suppresses Replication Fork Reversal in BRCA-Deficient Cells.Acute treatment with replication-stalling chemotherapeutics causes reversal of replication forks. BRCA proteins protect reversed forks from nucleolytic degradation, and their loss leads to chemosensitivity. Here, we show that fork degradation is no longer detectable in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells exposed to multiple cisplatin doses, mimicking a clinical treatment regimen. This effect depends on increased expression and chromatin loading of PRIMPOL and is regulated by ATR activity. Electron microscopy and single-molecule DNA fiber analyses reveal that PRIMPOL rescues fork degradation by reinitiating DNA synthesis past DNA lesions. PRIMPOL repriming leads to accumulation of ssDNA gaps while suppressing fork reversal. We propose that cells adapt to repeated cisplatin doses by activating PRIMPOL repriming under conditions that would otherwise promote pathological reversed fork degradation. This effect is generalizable to other conditions of impaired fork reversal (e.g., SMARCAL1 loss or PARP inhibition) and suggests a new strategy to modulate cisplatin chemosensitivity by targeting the PRIMPOL pathway."	1
"32160546"	"Transferrin Receptor Is a Specific Ferroptosis Marker.Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death driven by the iron-dependent accumulation of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids. There is no reliable way to selectively stain ferroptotic cells in tissue sections to characterize the extent of ferroptosis in animal models or patient samples. We address this gap by immunizing mice with membranes from lymphoma cells treated with the ferroptosis inducer piperazine erastin and screening ∼4,750 of the resulting monoclonal antibodies generated for their ability to selectively detect cells undergoing ferroptosis. We find that one antibody, 3F3 ferroptotic membrane antibody (3F3-FMA), is effective as a selective ferroptosis-staining reagent. The antigen of 3F3-FMA is identified as the human transferrin receptor 1 protein (TfR1). We validate this finding with several additional anti-TfR1 antibodies and compare them to other potential ferroptosis-detecting reagents. We find that anti-TfR1 and anti-malondialdehyde adduct antibodies are effective at staining ferroptotic tumor cells in multiple cell culture and tissue contexts."	0
"32726630"	"Neutrophil Caspase-11 Is Essential to Defend against a Cytosol-Invasive Bacterium.Either caspase-1 or caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D to cause pyroptosis, eliminating intracellular replication niches. We previously showed that macrophages detect Burkholderia thailandensis via NLRC4, triggering the release of interleukin (IL)-18 and driving an essential interferon (IFN)-γ response that primes caspase-11. We now identify the IFN-γ-producing cells as a mixture of natural killer (NK) and T cells. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D in macrophages and neutrophils, we find that NLRC4-activated caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis in macrophages, but this pathway does not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils. In contrast, caspase-11 triggers pyroptosis in both macrophages and neutrophils. This translates to an absolute requirement for caspase-11 in neutrophils during B. thailandensis infection in mice. We present an example of inflammasome sensors causing diverging outcomes in different cell types. Thus, cell fates are dictated not simply by the pathogen or inflammasome, but also by how the cell is wired to respond to detection events."	0
"32217664"	"Telomere length heterogeneity in ALT cells is maintained by PML-dependent localization of the BTR complex to telomeres.Telomeres consist of TTAGGG repeats bound by protein complexes that serve to protect the natural end of linear chromosomes. Most cells maintain telomere repeat lengths by using the enzyme telomerase, although there are some cancer cells that use a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere extension, termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Cells that use ALT are characterized, in part, by the presence of specialized PML nuclear bodies called ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs localize to and cluster telomeric ends together with telomeric and DNA damage factors, which led to the proposal that these bodies act as a platform on which ALT can occur. However, the necessity of APBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly define the function of APBs in ALT. We found that PML is required for the ALT mechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs' role in localizing the BLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends. Strikingly, recruitment of the BTR complex to telomeres in a PML-independent manner bypasses the need for PML in the ALT pathway, suggesting that BTR localization to telomeres is sufficient to sustain ALT activity."	0
"32187535"	"Morphine and Naloxone Facilitate Neural Stem Cells Proliferation via a TET1-Dependent and Receptor-Independent Pathway.Normally, opioids function in a receptor-dependent manner. They bind to opioid receptors, activate or inhibit receptor activation, and subsequently modulate downstream signal transduction. However, the complex functions of opioids and the low expression of opioid receptors and their endogenous peptide agonists in neural stem cells (NSCs) suggest that some opioids may also modulate NSCs via a receptor-independent pathway. In the current study, two opioids, morphine and naloxone, are demonstrated to facilitate NSC proliferation via a receptor-independent and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1)-dependent pathway. Morphine and naloxone penetrate cell membrane, bind to TET1 protein via three key residues (1,880-1,882), and subsequently result in facilitated proliferation of NSCs. In addition, the two opioids also inhibit the DNA demethylation ability of TET1. In summary, the current results connect opioids and DNA demethylation directly at least in NSCs and extend our understanding on both opioids and NSCs."	1
"31626750"	"Properties of Stress Granule and P-Body Proteomes.Stress granules and P-bodies are cytosolic biomolecular condensates that dynamically form by the phase separation of RNAs and proteins. They participate in translational control and buffer the proteome. Upon stress, global translation halts and mRNAs bound to the translational machinery and other proteins coalesce to form stress granules (SGs). Similarly, translationally stalled mRNAs devoid of translation initiation factors shuttle to P-bodies (PBs). Here, we review the cumulative progress made in defining the protein components that associate with mammalian SGs and PBs. We discuss the composition of SG and PB proteomes, supported by a new user-friendly database (http://rnagranuledb.lunenfeld.ca/) that curates current literature evidence for genes or proteins associated with SGs or PBs. As previously observed, the SG and PB proteomes are biased toward intrinsically disordered regions and have a high propensity to contain primary sequence features favoring phase separation. We also provide an outlook on how the various components of SGs and PBs may cooperate to organize and form membraneless organelles."	0
"32209459"	"Route of Vaccine Administration Alters Antigen Trafficking but Not Innate or Adaptive Immunity.Although intramuscular (i.m.) administration is the most commonly used route for licensed vaccines, subcutaneous (s.c.) delivery is being explored for several new vaccines under development. Here, we use rhesus macaques, physiologically relevant to humans, to identify the anatomical compartments and early immune processes engaged in the response to immunization via the two routes. Administration of fluorescently labeled HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers displayed on liposomes enables visualization of targeted cells and tissues. Both s.c. and i.m. routes induce efficient immune cell infiltration, activation, and antigen uptake, functions that are tightly restricted to the skin and muscle, respectively. Antigen is also transported to different lymph nodes depending on route. However, these early differences do not translate into significant differences in the magnitude or quality of antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses over time. Thus, although some distinct immunological differences are noted, the choice of route may instead be motivated by clinical practicality."	0
"32023449"	"Human Fc Receptor-like 3 Inhibits Regulatory T Cell Function and Binds Secretory IgA.Human Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3) is an orphan receptor expressed by lymphocytes, including regulatory T cells. FCRL3 is implicated in several autoimmune diseases; however, its function on regulatory T cells is unknown. We discovered that FCRL3 stimulation of regulatory T cells inhibited their suppressive function. Moreover, FCRL3 stimulation induced IL-17, IL-26, and IFNγ production and promoted expression of the Th17-defining transcription factor RORγt without affecting FOXP3 expression. We suggest that FCRL3 engagement mediates a transition of regulatory T cells to a pro-inflammatory Th17-like phenotype. In addition, we identified secretory IgA as a specific FCRL3 ligand. Secretory IgA could serve as an environmental cue for mucosal breaches and locally drive regulatory T cell plasticity to help control infection. Our findings define a mechanism that explains the recognized association of FCRL3 with autoimmune diseases. Targeting FCRL3 to modulate regulatory T cell activity could be exploited to treat both malignancies and autoimmune diseases."	0
"31901447"	"Lipid Droplet-Derived Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Traffic via PLIN5 to Allosterically Activate SIRT1.Lipid droplets (LDs) provide a reservoir for triacylglycerol storage and are a central hub for fatty acid trafficking and signaling in cells. Lipolysis promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism via a SIRT1/PGC-1α/PPARα-dependent pathway through an unknown mechanism. Herein, we identify that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) allosterically activate SIRT1 toward select peptide-substrates such as PGC-1α. MUFAs enhance PGC-1α/PPARα signaling and promote oxidative metabolism in cells and animal models in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Moreover, we characterize the LD protein perilipin 5 (PLIN5), which is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and function, to be a fatty-acid-binding protein that preferentially binds LD-derived monounsaturated fatty acids and traffics them to the nucleus following cAMP/PKA-mediated lipolytic stimulation. Thus, these studies identify the first-known endogenous allosteric modulators of SIRT1 and characterize a LD-nuclear signaling axis that underlies the known metabolic benefits of MUFAs and PLIN5."	1
"32579913"	"Structure-Based Identification and Functional Characterization of a Lipocalin in the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Proteins of the lipocalin family are known to bind small hydrophobic ligands and are involved in various physiological processes ranging from lipid transport to oxidative stress responses. The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains a single protein PF3D7_0925900 with a lipocalin signature. Using crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that the protein has a tetrameric structure of typical lipocalin monomers; hence we name it P. falciparum lipocalin (PfLCN). We show that PfLCN is expressed in the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite and localizes to the parasitophorous and food vacuoles. Conditional knockdown of PfLCN impairs parasite development, which can be rescued by treatment with the radical scavenger Trolox or by temporal inhibition of hemoglobin digestion. This suggests a key function of PfLCN in counteracting oxidative stress-induced cell damage during multiplication of parasites within erythrocytes."	0
"32504554"	"Tumor Interferon Signaling Is Regulated by a lncRNA INCR1 Transcribed from the PD-L1 Locus.Tumor interferon (IFN) signaling promotes PD-L1 expression to suppress T cell-mediated immunosurveillance. We identify the IFN-stimulated non-coding RNA 1 (INCR1) as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from the PD-L1 locus and show that INCR1 controls IFNγ signaling in multiple tumor types. Silencing INCR1 decreases the expression of PD-L1, JAK2, and several other IFNγ-stimulated genes. INCR1 knockdown sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing, improving CAR T cell therapy. We discover that PD-L1 and JAK2 transcripts are negatively regulated by binding to HNRNPH1, a nuclear ribonucleoprotein. The primary transcript of INCR1 binds HNRNPH1 to block its inhibitory effects on the neighboring genes PD-L1 and JAK2, enabling their expression. These findings introduce a mechanism of tumor IFNγ signaling regulation mediated by the lncRNA INCR1 and suggest a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy."	0

Starting from circ-ZNF609 as a study case, we discover that specific m<sup>6</sup>As control its accumulation and that METTL3 and YTHDC1 are required to direct the back-splicing reaction. This feature is shared with other circRNAs because we find a significant direct correlation among METTL3 requirement, YTHDC1 binding, and the ability of m<sup>6</sup>A exons to undergo back-splicing.

"32209465"	"Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection Promotes Histone H3 Dephosphorylation by Modulating Host PP1 Phosphatase.Pathogenic bacteria can alter host gene expression through post-translational modifications of histones. We show that a natural colonizer, Streptococcus pneumoniae, induces specific histone modifications, including robust dephosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 (H3S10), during infection of respiratory epithelial cells. The bacterial pore-forming toxin pneumolysin (PLY), along with the pyruvate oxidase SpxB responsible for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, play important roles in the induction of this modification. The combined effects of PLY and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> trigger host signaling that culminates in H3S10 dephosphorylation, which is mediated by the host cell phosphatase PP1. Strikingly, S. pneumoniae infection induces dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of PP1 catalytic activity. Colonization of PP1 catalytically deficient cells results in impaired intracellular S. pneumoniae survival and infection. Interestingly, PP1 activation and H3S10 dephosphorylation are not restricted to S. pneumoniae and appear to be general epigenomic mechanisms favoring intracellular survival of pathogenic bacteria."	0
"32905770"	"Metabolic Control of Gametophore Shoot Formation through Arginine in the Moss Physcomitrium patens.Shoot formation is accompanied by active cell proliferation and expansion, requiring that metabolic state adapts to developmental control. Despite the importance of such metabolic reprogramming, it remains unclear how development and metabolism are integrated. Here, we show that disruption of ANGUSTIFOLIA3 orthologs (PpAN3s) compromises gametophore shoot formation in the moss Physcomitrium patens due to defective cell proliferation and expansion. Trans-omics analysis reveals that the downstream activity of PpAN3 is linked to arginine metabolism. Elevating arginine level by chemical treatment leads to stunted gametophores and causes Ppan3 mutant-like transcriptional changes in the wild-type plant. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtAN3 from Arabidopsis thaliana ameliorates the defective arginine metabolism and promotes gametophore formation in Ppan3 mutants. Together, these findings indicate that arginine metabolism is a key pathway associated with gametophore formation and provide evolutionary insights into the establishment of the shoot system in land plants through the integration of developmental and metabolic processes."	0
"32268080"	"A Targeted Multi-omic Analysis Approach Measures Protein Expression and Low-Abundance Transcripts on the Single-Cell Level.High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a frequently used tool to assess immune cell heterogeneity. Recently, the combined measurement of RNA and protein expression was developed, commonly known as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq). Acquisition of protein expression data along with transcriptome data resolves some of the limitations inherent to only assessing transcripts but also nearly doubles the sequencing read depth required per single cell. Furthermore, there is still a paucity of analysis tools to visualize combined transcript-protein datasets. Here, we describe a targeted transcriptomics approach that combines an analysis of over 400 genes with simultaneous measurement of over 40 proteins on 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells in a single experiment. This targeted approach requires only about one-tenth of the read depth compared to a whole-transcriptome approach while retaining high sensitivity for low abundance transcripts.

"32115407"	"Coordination of germ layer lineage choice by TET1 during primed pluripotency.Gastrulation in the early postimplantation stage mammalian embryo begins when epiblast cells ingress to form the primitive streak or develop as the embryonic ectoderm. The DNA dioxygenase Tet1 is highly expressed in the epiblast and yet continues to regulate lineage specification during gastrulation when its expression is diminished. Here, we show how Tet1 plays a pivotal role upstream of germ layer lineage bifurcation. During the transition from naive pluripotency to lineage priming, a global reconfiguration redistributes Tet1 from Oct4-cobound promoters to distal regulatory elements at lineage differentiation genes, which are distinct from high-affinity sites engaged by Oct4. An altered chromatin landscape in <i>Tet1</i>-deficient primed epiblast-like cells is associated with enhanced Oct4 expression and binding to Nodal and Wnt target genes, resulting in collaborative signals that enhance mesendodermal and inhibit neuroectodermal gene expression during lineage segregation. A permissive role for Tet1 in neural fate induction involves Zic2-dependent engagement at neural target genes at lineage priming, is dependent on the signaling environment during gastrulation, and impacts neural tube closure after gastrulation. Our findings provide mechanistic information for epigenetic integration of pluripotency and signal-induced differentiation cues."	0

We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from ∼3-5 kb/h up to ∼10-20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA. These results identify a role for Rad52 in limiting ssDNA generated by end resection."	1

This metabolism-epigenome link sensitizes chromatin methylation to altered SAM abundance, yet the mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt and protect epigenetic information during life-experienced fluctuations in SAM availability are unknown. We identified a robust response to SAM depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under SAM-depleted conditions, H3K9 mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to SAM depletion in vivo. Together, these studies provide evidence for an adaptive response that enables epigenetic persistence to metabolic stress."	0

PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1-PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes. PCGF2 associates with transcription repression, whereas PCGF3 and PCGF6 associate with actively transcribed genes. Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1).

However, it remains unclear how changes in LIN28 expression define patterns of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here we show that LIN28 expression level is a key variable that sets the magnitude of protein translation. By systematically varying LIN28B protein levels in human cells, we discovered a dose-dependent divergence in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy that enabled the formation of two discrete translational subpopulations composed of nearly all expressed genes. This bifurcation in gene expression was mediated by a redistribution in Argonaute association, from let-7 to non-let-7 microRNA families, resulting in a global shift in cellular miRNA activity. Post-transcriptional effects were scaled across the physiological LIN28 expression range. Together, these data highlight the central importance of RBP expression level and its ability to encode regulation."	0

Transfer of genetic material is achieved mainly through extracellular vesicles (EVs), although cell fusion also plays a minor role. We further demonstrate that EV-mediated communication leads to the increase of synaptic activity in neurons. Blocking EV release causes a reduction of glioma growth in vivo.

Here, we demonstrate that RAD51-dependent replication fork reversal induced by R-loops is followed by the restart of semiconservative DNA replication mediated by RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases, MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, RAD52 strand-annealing factor, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)/XRCC4 complex, and the non-catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, POLD3. RECQ5 disrupts RAD51 filaments assembled on stalled forks after RECQ1-mediated reverse branch migration, preventing a new round of fork reversal and facilitating fork cleavage by MUS81/EME1. MUS81-dependent DNA breaks accumulate in cells lacking RAD52 or LIG4 upon induction of R-loop formation, suggesting that RAD52 acts in concert with LIG4/XRCC4 to catalyze fork religation, thereby mediating replication restart. The resumption of DNA synthesis after R-loop-associated fork stalling also requires active transcription, the restoration of which depends on MUS81, RAD52, LIG4, and the transcription elongation factor ELL.

It remains unclear how the changing information in a growing nascent polypeptide dictates the recruitment of functionally distinct chaperones. Here, we used ribosome profiling to define the principles governing the cotranslational action of the chaperones TRiC/CCT and Hsp70/Ssb. We show that these chaperones are sequentially recruited to specific sites within domain-encoding regions of select nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 associates first, binding select sites throughout domains, whereas TRiC associates later, upon the emergence of nearly complete domains that expose an unprotected hydrophobic surface. This suggests that transient topological properties of nascent folding intermediates drive sequential chaperone association. Moreover, cotranslational recruitment of both TRiC and Hsp70 correlated with translation elongation slowdowns. We propose that the temporal modulation of the nascent chain structural landscape is coordinated with local elongation rates to regulate the hierarchical action of Hsp70 and TRiC for cotranslational folding."	0

We here compare molecular features of USP25 and USP28. Active enzymes form distinctively shaped dimers, with a dimerizing insertion spatially separating independently active catalytic domains. In USP25, but not USP28, two dimers can form an autoinhibited tetramer, where a USP25-specific, conserved insertion sequence blocks ubiquitin binding. In full-length enzymes, a C-terminal domain with a previously unknown fold has no impact on oligomerization, but N-terminal regions affect the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in vitro. We confirm oligomeric states of USP25 and USP28 in cells and show that modulating oligomerization affects substrate stabilization in accordance with in vitro activity data. Our work highlights how regions outside of the catalytic domain enable a conceptually intriguing interplay of DUB oligomerization and activity."	0

This complex system is challenging to study, particularly in mammals, where it remains unclear whether decay pathways perform specialized versus redundant roles.

By directly profiling decay factor targets and normal versus aberrant translation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we uncovered extensive decay pathway specialization and crosstalk with translation. XRN1 (5'-3') mediates cytoplasmic bulk mRNA turnover whereas SKIV2L (3'-5') is universally recruited by ribosomes, tackling aberrant translation and sometimes modulating mRNA abundance. Further exploring translation surveillance revealed AVEN and FOCAD as SKIV2L interactors. AVEN prevents ribosome stalls at structured regions, which otherwise require SKIV2L for clearance. This pathway is crucial for histone translation, upstream open reading frame (uORF) regulation, and counteracting ribosome arrest on small ORFs.

"32651229"	"Retromer forms low order oligomers on supported lipid bilayers.Retromer orchestrates the selection and export of integral membrane proteins from the endosome via retrograde and plasma membrane recycling pathways. Long-standing hypotheses regarding the retromer sorting mechanism posit that oligomeric interactions between retromer and associated accessory factors on the endosome membrane drives clustering of retromer-bound integral membrane cargo prior to its packaging into a nascent transport carrier. To test this idea, we examined interactions between components of the sorting nexin 3 (SNX3)-retromer sorting pathway using quantitative single particle fluorescence microscopy in a reconstituted system. This system includes a supported lipid bilayer, fluorescently labeled retromer, SNX3, and two model cargo proteins, RAB7, and retromer-binding segments of the WASHC2C subunit of the WASH complex. We found that the distribution of membrane-associated retromer is predominantly comprised of monomer (∼18%), dimer (∼35%), trimer (∼24%), and tetramer (∼13%). Unexpectedly, neither the presence of membrane-associated cargo nor accessory factors substantially affected this distribution. The results indicate that retromer has an intrinsic propensity to form low order oligomers on a supported lipid bilayer and that neither membrane association nor accessory factors potentiate oligomerization. The results support a model whereby SNX3-retromer is a minimally concentrative coat protein complex adapted to bulk membrane trafficking from the endosomal system."	0

The relevance of cell-surface glycosylation to HIV persistence has never been explored. We characterize the relationship between cell-surface glycomic signatures and persistent HIV transcription in vivo. We find that the cell surface of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells actively transcribing HIV, despite suppressive therapy, harbors high levels of fucosylated carbohydrate ligands, including the cell extravasation mediator Sialyl-Lewis<sup>X</sup> (SLe<sup>X</sup>), compared with HIV-infected transcriptionally inactive cells. These high levels of SLe<sup>X</sup> are induced by HIV transcription in vitro and are maintained after therapy in vivo. Cells with high-SLe<sup>X</sup> are enriched with markers associated with HIV susceptibility, signaling pathways that drive HIV transcription, and pathways involved in leukocyte extravasation. We describe a glycomic feature of HIV-infected transcriptionally active cells that not only differentiates them from their transcriptionally inactive counterparts but also may affect their trafficking abilities."	0
"30503774"	"Dynamics of Cas10 Govern Discrimination between Self and Non-self in Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity.Adaptive immune systems must accurately distinguish between self and non-self in order to defend against invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNA to recognize complementary RNA targets, which triggers the degradation of both the invader's transcripts and their template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations but circumvent damage to the host genome. To explore the molecular basis for these features, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10-the DNase effector of the complex-displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Target mutations differentially modulate Cas10 dynamics and tune the CRISPR interference activity in vivo. These findings highlight the central role of the internal dynamics of CRISPR-Cas complexes in self versus non-self discrimination and target specificity."	0

"32521274"	"Slow Receptor Binding of the Noncytopathic HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs Is Balanced by Long-Lived Activation State and Efficient Fusion Activity.Many HIV strains downregulate the levels of CD4 receptor on the surface of infected cells to prevent superinfection. In contrast, the rare HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> strain is noncytopathic and has no effect on CD4 expression in infected cells but still replicates as efficiently as more cytopathic strains in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we show that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Env interactions with the CD4 receptor exhibit slow association kinetics, whereas the dissociation kinetics is within the range of cytopathic strains. Despite the resulting 10- to 100-fold decrease in binding affinity, HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs exhibit long-lived activation state and efficient fusion activity. These observations suggest that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs evolved to balance low affinity with an improved and readily triggerable molecular machinery to mediate entry. Resistance to cold exposure, similar to many primary HIV-1 isolates, and to sCD4 neutralization suggests that HIV-2<sub>UC1</sub> Envs preferentially sample a closed Env conformation. Our data provide insights into the mechanism of HIV entry."	0
"30975460"	"RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.Nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors perceive pathogen effectors and trigger plant immunity. However, the mechanisms underlying NLR-triggered defense responses remain obscure. The recently discovered Pigm locus in rice encodes a cluster of NLRs, including PigmR, which confers broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus. Here, we identify PIBP1 (PigmR-INTERACTING and BLAST RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1), an RRM (RNA-recognition motif) protein that specifically interacts with PigmR and other similar NLRs to trigger blast resistance. PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance. We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression. Knockout of PIBP1 and Os06 g02240 greatly attenuated blast resistance. Collectively, our study discovers previously unappreciated RRM transcription factors that directly interact with NLRs to activate plant defense, establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of immune responses with NLR-mediated pathogen perception."	0

Our structure-function studies have focused on Thermococcus onnurineus Csm6 to deduce mechanistic insights into how cA<sub>4</sub> binding to the Csm6 CARF domain triggers the RNase activity of the Csm6 HEPN domain and what factors contribute to regulation of RNA cleavage activity. We demonstrate that the Csm6 CARF domain is a ring nuclease, whereby bound cA<sub>4</sub> is stepwise cleaved initially to ApApApA>p and subsequently to ApA>p in its CARF domain-binding pocket, with such cleavage bursts using a timer mechanism to regulate the RNase activity of the Csm6 HEPN domain.

We show that G3BP1-family-USP10 complexes are required for deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3, and RPS10 to rescue modified 40S subunits from programmed degradation. Knockout of USP10 or G3BP1 family proteins increased lysosomal ribosomal degradation and perturbed ribosomal subunit stoichiometry, both of which were rescued by a single K214R substitution of RPS3. While the majority of RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination resulted from ZNF598-dependent sensing of ribosome collisions initiating RQC, another minor pathway contributed to their monoubiquitination. G3BP1 family proteins have long been considered RNA-binding proteins, however, our results identified 40S subunits and associated mRNAs as their predominant targets, a feature shared by stress granules to which G3BP1 family proteins localize under stress."	1
"32023484"	"Partitioning of MLX-Family Transcription Factors to Lipid Droplets Regulates Metabolic Gene Expression.Lipid droplets (LDs) store lipids for energy and are central to cellular lipid homeostasis. The mechanisms coordinating lipid storage in LDs with cellular metabolism are unclear but relevant to obesity-related diseases. Here we utilized genome-wide screening to identify genes that modulate lipid storage in macrophages, a cell type involved in metabolic diseases. Among ∼550 identified screen hits is MLX, a basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper transcription factor that regulates metabolic processes. We show that MLX and glucose-sensing family members MLXIP/MondoA and MLXIPL/ChREBP bind LDs via C-terminal amphipathic helices. When LDs accumulate in cells, these transcription factors bind to LDs, reducing their availability for transcriptional activity and attenuating the response to glucose. Conversely, the absence of LDs results in hyperactivation of MLX target genes. Our findings uncover a paradigm for a lipid storage response in which binding of MLX transcription factors to LD surfaces adjusts the expression of metabolic genes to lipid storage levels."	0
"31351878"	"Network Rewiring of Homologous Recombination Enzymes during Mitotic Proliferation and Meiosis.Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for high-fidelity DNA repair during mitotic proliferation and meiosis. Yet, context-specific modifications must tailor the recombination machinery to avoid (mitosis) or enforce (meiosis) the formation of reciprocal exchanges-crossovers-between recombining chromosomes. To obtain molecular insight into how crossover control is achieved, we affinity purified 7 DNA-processing enzymes that channel HR intermediates into crossovers or noncrossovers from vegetative cells or cells undergoing meiosis. Using mass spectrometry, we provide a global characterization of their composition and reveal mitosis- and meiosis-specific modules in the interaction networks. Functional analyses of meiosis-specific interactors of MutLγ-Exo1 identified Rtk1, Caf120, and Chd1 as regulators of crossing-over. Chd1, which transiently associates with Exo1 at the prophase-to-metaphase I transition, enables the formation of MutLγ-dependent crossovers through its conserved ability to bind and displace nucleosomes. Thus, rewiring of the HR network, coupled to chromatin remodeling, promotes context-specific control of the recombination outcome."	0

The paracrine pathway for MSC-mediated IL-10<sup>+</sup> macrophage functionality and response to tissue injury is not fully understood. In our present study, clodronate pre-treatment of colitic mice confirms the essential role of endogenous macrophages in bone-marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC)-mediated clinical rescue of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. We identify that BM-MSC-secreted chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) cooperate as a heterodimer to upregulate IL-10 expression in CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages in vitro and that CCL2 expression by MSC is required for IL-10<sup>+</sup> polarization of intestinal and peritoneal resident macrophages in vivo. We observe that tissue macrophage IL-10 polarization in vivo is widespread involving extra-intestinal tissues and secondarily leads to bystander IL-10 expression in intestine-resident B and T cells.

The molecular function of the encoded protein, myosin-18B (M18B), within the developing muscle is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant M18B lacks motor ATPase activity and harbors previously uncharacterized N-terminal actin-binding domains, properties that make M18B an efficient actin cross-linker and molecular brake capable of regulating muscle myosin-2 contractile forces. Spatiotemporal analysis of M18B throughout cardiomyogenesis and myofibrillogenesis reveals that this structural myosin undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution during myogenic differentiation, where its incorporation within muscle stress fibers coincides with actin striation onset. Furthermore, this analysis shows that M18B is directly integrated within the muscle myosin thick filament during myofibril maturation. Altogether, our data suggest that M18B has evolved specific biochemical properties that allow it to define and maintain sarcomeric organization from within the thick filament via its dual actin cross-linking and motor modulating capabilities."	0
"32504555"	"Gene Architecture and Sequence Composition Underpin Selective Dependency of Nuclear Export of Long RNAs on NXF1 and the TREX Complex.The core components of the nuclear RNA export pathway are thought to be required for export of virtually all polyadenylated RNAs. Here, we depleted different proteins that act in nuclear export in human cells and quantified the transcriptome-wide consequences on RNA localization. Different genes exhibited substantially variable sensitivities, with depletion of NXF1 and TREX components causing some transcripts to become strongly retained in the nucleus while others were not affected. Specifically, NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U content, whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts. Using massively parallel reporter assays, we identified short sequence elements that render transcripts dependent on NXF1 for their export and identified synergistic effects of splicing and NXF1. These results revise the current model of how nuclear export shapes the distribution of RNA within human cells."	0

"31784358"	"MeCP2 Represses the Rate of Transcriptional Initiation of Highly Methylated Long Genes.Mutations in the methyl-DNA-binding repressor protein MeCP2 cause the devastating neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome. It has been challenging to understand how MeCP2 regulates transcription because MeCP2 binds broadly across the genome and MeCP2 mutations are associated with widespread small-magnitude changes in neuronal gene expression. We demonstrate here that MeCP2 represses nascent RNA transcription of highly methylated long genes in the brain through its interaction with the NCoR co-repressor complex. By measuring the rates of transcriptional initiation and elongation directly in the brain, we find that MeCP2 has no measurable effect on transcriptional elongation, but instead represses the rate at which Pol II initiates transcription of highly methylated long genes. These findings suggest a new model of MeCP2 function in which MeCP2 binds broadly across highly methylated regions of DNA, but acts at transcription start sites to attenuate transcriptional initiation."	0
"32460027"	"A Landscape of Murine Long Non-Coding RNAs Reveals the Leading Transcriptome Alterations in Adipose Tissue during Aging.Aging is an inevitable process that involves profound physiological changes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in various biological processes but are not systemically studied in aging. To provide an organism-wide lncRNA landscape during aging, we conduct comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses across the mouse lifespan. Of the 1,675 aging-regulated lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) identified, the majority are connected to inflammation-related biological pathways. AR-lncRNAs exhibit high tissue specificity; conversely, those with higher tissue specificity are preferentially regulated during aging. White adipose tissue (WAT) displays the highest number of AR-lncRNAs and develops the most dynamic crosstalk between AR-lncRNA and AR-mRNA during aging. An adipose-enriched AR-lncRNA, lnc-adipoAR1, is negatively correlated with aging, and knocking it down inhibits adipogenesis, phenocopying the compromised adipogenic capacity of aged fat. Our works together reveal AR-lncRNAs as essential components in aging and suggest that although each tissue ages in a distinct manner, WAT is a leading contributor to aging-related health decline."	0

Here, we map a DNA-binding interface to the S compartment of E heads SmcScpAB and show that head-DNA association is essential for efficient DNA translocation and for traversing highly transcribed genes in Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that in J heads, SmcScpAB chromosomal DNA resides in the K compartment but is absent from the S compartment. Our results imply that the DNA occupancy of the S compartment changes during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. We propose that DNA translocation involves DNA entry into and exit out of the S compartment, possibly by DNA transfer between compartments and DNA segment capture."	0

It was suggested that some histidines could play the role of pH-sensitive switches. By mutating histidine residues H22, H60, H132, H162, H389, H397, H407, and H409, we demonstrate that residues H389 and D280, facing each other in the six-helix bundle of the post-fusion state, and more prominently H407, located at the interface between the C-terminal part of the ectodomain and the fusion domain, are crucial for fusion. Passages of recombinant viruses bearing mutant G resulted in the selection of compensatory mutations. Thus, the H407A mutation in G resulted in two independent compensatory mutants, L396I and S422I. Together with a crystal structure of G, presented here, which extends our knowledge of G pre-fusion structure, this indicates that the conformational transition is initiated by refolding of the C-terminal part of the G ectodomain."	0
"32493771"	"Picornaviral polymerase domain exchanges reveal a modular basis for distinct biochemical activities of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.Picornaviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) have low replication fidelity that is essential for viral fitness and evolution. Their global fold consists of the classical ""cupped right hand"" structure with palm, fingers, and thumb domains, and these RdRPs also possess a unique contact between the fingers and thumb domains. This interaction restricts movements of the fingers, and RdRPs use a subtle conformational change within the palm domain to close their active sites for catalysis. We have previously shown that this core RdRP structure and mechanism provide a platform for polymerases to fine-tune replication rates and fidelity to optimize virus fitness. Here, we further elucidated the structural basis for differences in replication rates and fidelity among different viruses by generating chimeric RdRPs from poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3. We designed these chimeric polymerases by exchanging the fingers, pinky finger, or thumb domains. The results of biochemical, rapid-quench, and stopped-flow assays revealed that differences in biochemical activity map to individual modular domains of this polymerase. We found that the pinky finger subdomain is a major regulator of initiation and that the palm domain is the major determinant of catalytic rate and nucleotide discrimination. We further noted that thumb domain interactions with product RNA regulate translocation and that the palm and thumb domains coordinately control elongation complex stability. Several RdRP chimeras supported the growth of infectious poliovirus, providing insights into enterovirus species-specific protein-protein interactions required for virus replication."	0
"32160558"	"Single-Cell Analysis of the Muscle Stem Cell Hierarchy Identifies Heterotypic Communication Signals Involved in Skeletal Muscle Regeneration.Muscle regeneration relies on the regulation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) through paracrine signaling interactions. We analyzed muscle regeneration in mice using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and generated over 34,000 single-cell transcriptomes spanning four time-points. We identified 15 distinct cell types including heterogenous populations of muscle stem and progenitor cells. We resolved a hierarchical map of these myogenic cells by trajectory inference and observed stage-specific regulatory programs within this continuum. Through ligand-receptor interaction analysis, we identified over 100 candidate regeneration-associated paracrine communication pairs between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells. We show that myogenic stem/progenitor cells exhibit heterogeneous expression of multiple Syndecan proteins in cycling myogenic cells, suggesting that Syndecans may coordinate myogenic fate regulation. We performed ligand stimulation in vitro and confirmed that three paracrine factors (FGF2, TGFβ1, and RSPO3) regulate myogenic cell proliferation in a Syndecan-dependent manner. Our study provides a scRNA-seq reference resource to investigate cell communication interactions in muscle regeneration."	0

It has been reported that runt-related transcription factor 1 (<i>Runx1</i>) is expressed in osteoblast progenitors, pre-osteoblasts, and mature osteoblasts; yet, surprisingly, the exact function of RUNX1 in osteoblast maturation and bone formation remains unknown. Here, we generated and characterized a pre-osteoblast and differentiating chondrocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i> conditional knockout mouse model to study RUNX1's function in bone formation. <i>Runx1</i> ablation in osteoblast precursors and differentiating chondrocytes via osterix-Cre (Osx-Cre) resulted in an osteoporotic phenotype and decreased bone density in the long bones and skulls of <i>Runx1<sup>f/f</sup>Osx-Cre</i> mice compared with <i>Runx1<sup>f/f</sup></i> and <i>Osx-Cre</i> mice. RUNX1 deficiency reduced the expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), Indian hedgehog signaling molecule (IHH), Patched (PTC), and cyclin D1 in the growth plate, and also reduced the expression of osteocalcin (OCN), OSX, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and RUNX2 in osteoblasts. ChIP assays and promoter activity mapping revealed that RUNX1 directly associates with the <i>Runx2</i> gene promoter and up-regulates <i>Runx2</i> expression. Furthermore, the ChIP data also showed that RUNX1 associates with the <i>Ocn</i> promoter. In conclusion, RUNX1 up-regulates the expression of <i>Runx2</i> and multiple bone-specific genes, and plays an indispensable role in bone formation and homeostasis in both trabecular and cortical bone. We propose that stimulating <i>Runx1</i> activity may be useful in therapeutic approaches for managing some bone diseases such as osteoporosis."	1

Nerve terminal availability of TRPM8 determines cold sensitivity, but how axonal secretory organelles control channel delivery remains poorly understood. Here we examine the distribution of TRPM8 and trafficking organelles in cold-sensitive peripheral axons and disrupt trafficking by targeting the ARF-GEF GBF1 pharmacologically or the small GTPase RAB6 by optogenetics. In axons of the sciatic nerve, inhibition of GBF1 interrupts TRPM8 trafficking and increases association with the trans-Golgi network, LAMP1, and Golgi satellites, which distribute profusely along the axonal shaft. Accordingly, both TRPM8-dependent ongoing activity and cold-evoked responses reversibly decline upon GBF1 inhibition in nerve endings of corneal cold thermoreceptors. Inhibition of RAB6, which also associates to Golgi satellites, decreases cold-induced responses in vivo. Our results support a non-conventional axonal trafficking mechanism controlling the availability of TRPM8 in axons and cold sensitivity in the peripheral nervous system."	0

Nonetheless, a subset of physiologically important mRNAs (<i>e.g.</i> hypoxia-inducible factor 1α [HIF-1α], fibroblast growth factor 9 [FGF-9], and p53) is still translated by an unknown, cap-independent mechanism. Additionally, expression levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) and of its homolog, death-associated protein 5 (DAP5), are elevated. By examining the 5' UTRs of HIF-1α, FGF-9, and p53 mRNAs and using fluorescence anisotropy binding studies, luciferase reporter-based <i>in vitro</i> translation assays, and mutational analyses, we demonstrate here that eIF4GI and DAP5 specifically bind to the 5' UTRs of these cap-independently translated mRNAs. Surprisingly, we found that the eIF4E-binding domain of eIF4GI increases not only the binding affinity but also the selectivity among these mRNAs. We further demonstrate that the affinities of eIF4GI and DAP5 binding to these 5' UTRs correlate with the efficiency with which these factors drive cap-independent translation of these mRNAs. Integrating the results of our binding and translation assays, we conclude that eIF4GI or DAP5 is critical for recruitment of a specific subset of mRNAs to the ribosome, providing mechanistic insight into their cap-independent translation."	0

This led us to develop a model of airway basal stem cell (ABSC) hyperproliferation by driving Wnt/β-catenin signaling, resulting in a morphology that resembles premalignant lesions and loss of ciliated cell differentiation.

Herein, we report that functional Tregs are reduced at the maternal-fetal interface in a subset of women with idiopathic preterm labor/birth, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase in Tc17 cells. In mice, depletion of functional Tregs during late gestation induces preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcomes, which are rescued by the adoptive transfer of such cells. Treg depletion does not alter obstetrical parameters in the mother, yet it increases susceptibility to endotoxin-induced preterm birth. The mechanisms whereby depletion of Tregs induces adverse perinatal outcomes involve tissue-specific immune responses and mild systemic maternal inflammation, together with dysregulation of developmental and cellular processes in the placenta, in the absence of intra-amniotic inflammation. These findings provide mechanistic evidence supporting a role for Tregs in the pathophysiology of idiopathic preterm labor/birth and adverse neonatal outcomes."	0
"32130898"	"Gut Dysbiosis during Influenza Contributes to Pulmonary Pneumococcal Superinfection through Altered Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production.Secondary bacterial infections often complicate viral respiratory infections. We hypothesize that perturbation of the gut microbiota during influenza A virus (IAV) infection might favor respiratory bacterial superinfection. Sublethal infection with influenza transiently alters the composition and fermentative activity of the gut microbiota in mice. These changes are attributed in part to reduced food consumption. Fecal transfer experiments demonstrate that the IAV-conditioned microbiota compromises lung defenses against pneumococcal infection. In mechanistic terms, reduced production of the predominant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate affects the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages. Following treatment with acetate, mice colonized with the IAV-conditioned microbiota display reduced bacterial loads. In the context of influenza infection, acetate supplementation reduces, in a free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)-dependent manner, local and systemic bacterial loads. This translates into reduced lung pathology and improved survival rates of double-infected mice. Lastly, pharmacological activation of the SCFA receptor FFAR2 during influenza reduces bacterial superinfection."	0

To search for additional targets whose inhibition is synthetically lethal in BRCA2-deficient backgrounds, we screened two pairs of BRCA2 isogenic cell lines with DNA-repair-focused small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based libraries. We found that BRCA2-deficient cells are selectively dependent on multiple pathways including base excision repair, ATR signaling, and splicing. We identified APEX2 and FEN1 as synthetic lethal genes with both BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss of function. BRCA2-deficient cells require the apurinic endonuclease activity and the PCNA-binding domain of Ape2 (APEX2), but not Ape1 (APEX1). Furthermore, BRCA2-deficient cells require the 5' flap endonuclease but not the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Fen1, and chemically inhibiting Fen1 selectively targets BRCA-deficient cells.

"32029457"	"Interplay between compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and consumption: a focus on the PARP family.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is an essential cofactor for redox enzymes, but also moonlights as a substrate for signaling enzymes. When used as a substrate by signaling enzymes, it is consumed, necessitating the recycling of NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption products (i.e., nicotinamide) via a salvage pathway in order to maintain NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. A major family of NAD<sup>+</sup> consumers in mammalian cells are poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs). PARPs comprise a family of 17 enzymes in humans, 16 of which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD<sup>+</sup> to macromolecular targets (namely, proteins, but also DNA and RNA). Because PARPs and the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes are subcellularly localized, an emerging concept is that the activity of PARPs and other NAD<sup>+</sup> consumers are regulated in a compartmentalized manner. In this review, I discuss NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, how different subcellular pools of NAD<sup>+</sup> are established and regulated, and how free NAD<sup>+</sup> levels can control signaling by PARPs and redox metabolism."	0
"31029541"	"Synergy between Variant PRC1 Complexes Defines Polycomb-Mediated Gene Repression.The Polycomb system modifies chromatin and plays an essential role in repressing gene expression to control normal mammalian development. However, the components and mechanisms that define how Polycomb protein complexes achieve this remain enigmatic. Here, we use combinatorial genetic perturbation coupled with quantitative genomics to discover the central determinants of Polycomb-mediated gene repression in mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which mediates higher-order chromatin structures, contributes little to gene repression. Instead, we uncover an unexpectedly high degree of synergy between variant PRC1 complexes, which is fundamental to gene repression. We further demonstrate that variant PRC1 complexes are responsible for distinct pools of H2A monoubiquitylation that are associated with repression of Polycomb target genes and silencing during X chromosome inactivation. Together, these discoveries reveal a new variant PRC1-dependent logic for Polycomb-mediated gene repression."	0
"32546480"	"Differences in self-association between kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 are associated with differential integrin binding.The integrin family of transmembrane adhesion receptors coordinates complex signaling networks that control the ability of cells to sense and communicate with the extracellular environment. Kindlin proteins are a central cytoplasmic component of these networks, directly binding integrin cytoplasmic domains and mediating interactions with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. The physiological importance of kindlins is well established, but how the scaffolding functions of kindlins are regulated at the molecular level is still unclear. Here, using a combination of GFP nanotrap association assays, pulldown and integrin-binding assays, and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that full-length kindlins can oligomerize (self-associate) in mammalian cells, and we propose that this self-association inhibits integrin binding and kindlin localization to focal adhesions. We show that both kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 can self-associate and that kindlin-3 self-association is more robust. Using chimeric mapping, we demonstrate that the F2PH and F3 subdomains are important for kindlin self-association. Through comparative sequence analysis of kindlin-2 and kindlin-3, we identify kindlin-3 point mutations that decrease self-association and enhance integrin binding, affording mutant kindlin-3 the ability to localize to focal adhesions. Our results support the notion that kindlin self-association negatively regulates integrin binding."	0
"32755589"	"RGS6 Mediates Effects of Voluntary Running on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.Voluntary running enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with consequences for hippocampal-dependent learning ability and mood regulation. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that voluntary running induces unique and dynamic gene expression changes specifically within the adult-born hippocampal neurons, with significant impact on genes involved in neuronal maturation and human diseases. We identify the regulator of G protein signaling 6 (RGS6) as a key factor that mediates running impact on adult-born neurons. RGS6 overexpression mimics the positive effects of voluntary running on morphological and physiological maturation of adult new neurons and reduced sensitivity of adult-born neurons to the inhibitory effect of GABA<sub>B</sub> (γ-Aminobutyric acid B) receptor activation. Knocking down RGS6 abolishes running-enhanced neuronal maturation and hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent learning and anxiolytic effect. Our study provides a data resource showing genome-wide intrinsic molecular changes in adult-born hippocampal neurons that contribute to voluntary running-induced neurogenesis."	0
"31679819"	"R-Loops Promote Antisense Transcription across the Mammalian Genome.Widespread antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) overlap with many protein-coding genes in mammals and emanate from gene promoter, enhancer, and termination regions. However, their origin and biological purpose remain unclear. We show that these antisense lncRNA can be generated by R-loops that form when nascent transcript invades the DNA duplex behind elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Biochemically, R-loops act as intrinsic Pol II promoters to induce de novo RNA synthesis. Furthermore, their removal across the human genome by RNase H1 overexpression causes the selective reduction of antisense transcription. Consequently, we predict that R-loops act to facilitate the synthesis of many gene proximal antisense lncRNA. Not only are R-loops widely associated with DNA damage and repair, but we now show that they have the capacity to promote de novo transcript synthesis that may have aided the evolution of gene regulation."	0
"32160538"	"Genomic Repeats Categorize Genes with Distinct Functions for Orchestrated Regulation.Repetitive elements are abundantly distributed in mammalian genomes. Here, we reveal a striking association between repeat subtypes and gene function. SINE, L1, and low-complexity repeats demarcate distinct functional categories of genes and may dictate the time and level of gene expression by providing binding sites for different regulatory proteins. Importantly, imaging and sequencing analysis show that L1 repeats sequester a large set of genes with specialized functions in nucleolus- and lamina-associated inactive domains that are depleted of SINE repeats. In addition, L1 transcripts bind extensively to its DNA in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Depletion of L1 RNA in ESCs leads to relocation of L1-enriched chromosomal segments from inactive domains to the nuclear interior and de-repression of L1-associated genes. These results demonstrate a role of L1 DNA and RNA in gene silencing and suggest a general theme of genomic repeats in orchestrating the function, regulation, and expression of their host genes."	0
"32937122"	"A Bisulfite-free Approach for Base-Resolution Analysis of Genomic 5-Carboxylcytosine.Due to an extreme rarity of 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) in the mammalian genome, investigation of its role brings a considerable challenge. Methods based on bisulfite sequencing have been proposed for genome-wide 5caC analysis. However, bisulfite-based sequencing of scarcely abundant 5caC demands significant experimental and computational resources, increasing sequencing cost. Here, we present a bisulfite-free approach, caCLEAR, for high-resolution mapping of 5caCGs. The method uses an atypical activity of the methyltransferase eM.SssI to remove a carboxyl group from 5caC, generating unmodified CGs, which are localized by uTOP-seq sequencing. Validation of caCLEAR on model DNA systems and mouse ESCs supports the suitability of caCLEAR for analysis of 5caCGs. The 5caCG profiles of naive and primed pluripotent ESCs reflect their distinct demethylation dynamics and demonstrate an association of 5caC with gene expression. Generally, we demonstrate that caCLEAR is a robust economical approach that could help provide deeper insights into biological roles of 5caC."	0
"32130909"	"Transmembrane Coordination of Preprotein Recognition and Motor Coupling by the Mitochondrial Presequence Receptor Tim50.Mitochondrial preproteins contain amino-terminal presequences directing them to the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23 complex). Depending on additional downstream import signals, TIM23 either inserts preproteins into the inner membrane or translocates them into the matrix. Matrix import requires the coupling of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) to TIM23. The molecular mechanisms coordinating preprotein recognition by TIM23 in the intermembrane space (IMS) with PAM activation in the matrix are unknown. Here we show that subsequent to presequence recognition in the IMS, the Tim50 matrix domain facilitates the recruitment of the coupling factor Pam17. Next, the IMS domain of Tim50 promotes PAM recruitment to TIM23. Finally, the Tim50 transmembrane segment stimulates the matrix-directed import-driving force exerted by PAM. We propose that recognition of preprotein segments in the IMS and transfer of signal information across the inner membrane by Tim50 determine import motor activation."	0

Here, we demonstrate that periostin deficiency significantly inhibits the occurrence of colorectal cancer in azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice. Moreover, periostin deficiency attenuates the severity of colitis and reduces the proliferation of tumor cells. Mechanistically, stromal fibroblast-derived periostin activates FAK-Src kinases through integrin-mediated outside-in signaling, which results in the activation of YAP/TAZ and, subsequently, IL-6 expression in tumor cells. Conversely, IL-6 induces periostin expression in fibroblasts by activating STAT3, which ultimately facilitates colorectal tumor development. These findings provide the evidence that periostin promotes colorectal tumorigenesis, and identify periostin- and IL-6-mediated tumor-stroma interaction as a promising target for treating colitis-associated colorectal cancer."	1

RIPK3 contains an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). However, the physiological roles of RIPK3 RHIM remain unclear. Here we generate knockin mice endogenously expressing the RIPK3 RHIM mutant, RIPK3<sup>V448P</sup>. Cells expressing RIPK3<sup>V448P</sup> are resistant to RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis, and Ripk3<sup>V448P/V448P</sup> mice rescue embryonic lethality of Fadd-deficient mice by intercrossing.

"32348764"	"Complex Genetic Architecture Underlies Regulation of Influenza-A-Virus-Specific Antibody Responses in the Collaborative Cross.Host genetic factors play a fundamental role in regulating humoral immunity to viral infection, including influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we utilize the Collaborative Cross (CC), a mouse genetic reference population, to study genetic regulation of variation in antibody response following IAV infection. CC mice show significant heritable variation in the magnitude, kinetics, and composition of IAV-specific antibody response. We map 23 genetic loci associated with this variation. Analysis of a subset of these loci finds that they broadly affect the antibody response to IAV as well as other viruses. Candidate genes are identified based on predicted variant consequences and haplotype-specific expression patterns, and several show overlap with genes identified in human mapping studies. These findings demonstrate that the host antibody response to IAV infection is under complex genetic control and highlight the utility of the CC in modeling and identifying genetic factors with translational relevance to human health and disease."	0
"32698007"	"Degradation of Non-coding RNAs Promotes Recycling of Termination Factors at Sites of Transcription.A large share of the non-coding transcriptome in yeast is controlled by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which promotes transcription termination of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and by the nuclear exosome, which limits the steady-state levels of the transcripts produced. How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation."	0
"32492420"	"TMEM163 Regulates ATP-Gated P2X Receptor and Behavior.Fast purinergic signaling is mediated by ATP and ATP-gated ionotropic P2X receptors (P2XRs), and it is implicated in pain-related behaviors. The properties exhibited by P2XRs vary between those expressed in heterologous cells and in vivo. Several modulators of ligand-gated ion channels have recently been identified, suggesting that there are P2XR functional modulators in vivo. Here, we establish a genome-wide open reading frame (ORF) collection and perform functional screening to identify modulators of P2XR activity. We identify TMEM163, which specifically modulates the channel properties and pharmacology of P2XRs. We also find that TMEM163 is required for full function of the neuronal P2XR and a pain-related ATP-evoked behavior. These results establish TMEM163 as a critical modulator of P2XRs in vivo and a potential target for the discovery of drugs for treating pain."	0
"30905509"	"Extensive Recovery of Embryonic Enhancer and Gene Memory Stored in Hypomethylated Enhancer DNA.Developing and adult tissues use different cis-regulatory elements. Although DNA at some decommissioned embryonic enhancers is hypomethylated in adult cells, it is unknown whether this putative epigenetic memory is complete and recoverable. We find that, in adult mouse cells, hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides preserve a nearly complete archive of tissue-specific developmental enhancers. Sites that carry the active histone mark H3K4me1, and are therefore considered ""primed,"" are mainly cis elements that act late in organogenesis. In contrast, sites decommissioned early in development retain hypomethylated DNA as a singular property. In adult intestinal and blood cells, sustained absence of polycomb repressive complex 2 indirectly reactivates most-and only-hypomethylated developmental enhancers. Embryonic and fetal transcriptional programs re-emerge as a result, in reverse chronology to cis element inactivation during development. Thus, hypomethylated DNA in adult cells preserves a ""fossil record"" of tissue-specific developmental enhancers, stably marking decommissioned sites and enabling recovery of this epigenetic memory."	0

We apply CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to introduce three RBM20 mutations in iPSCs and differentiate them into iPSC-CMs to establish an in vitro model of RBM20 mutant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In iPSC-CMs harboring a known causal RBM20 variant, the splicing of RBM20 target genes, calcium handling, and contractility are impaired consistent with the disease manifestation in patients. A variant (Pro633Leu) identified by exome sequencing of patient genomes displays the same disease phenotypes, thus establishing this variant as disease causing. We find that all-trans retinoic acid upregulates RBM20 expression and reverts the splicing, calcium handling, and contractility defects in iPSC-CMs with different causal RBM20 mutations. These results suggest that pharmacological upregulation of RBM20 expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for DCM patients with a heterozygous mutation in RBM20."	0
"31226278"	"Modeling RNA-Binding Protein Specificity In Vivo by Precisely Registering Protein-RNA Crosslink Sites.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by recognizing short and degenerate sequence motifs in their target transcripts, but precisely defining their binding specificity remains challenging. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) allows for mapping of the exact protein-RNA crosslink sites, which frequently reside at specific positions in RBP motifs at single-nucleotide resolution. Here, we have developed a computational method, named mCross, to jointly model RBP binding specificity while precisely registering the crosslinking position in motif sites. We applied mCross to 112 RBPs using ENCODE eCLIP data and validated the reliability of the discovered motifs by genome-wide analysis of allelic binding sites. Our analyses revealed that the prototypical SR protein SRSF1 recognizes clusters of GGA half-sites in addition to its canonical GGAGGA motif. Therefore, SRSF1 regulates splicing of a much larger repertoire of transcripts than previously appreciated, including HNRNPD and HNRNPDL, which are involved in multivalent protein assemblies and phase separation."	0
"32587092"	"High-speed atomic force microscopy directly visualizes conformational dynamics of the HIV Vif protein in complex with three host proteins.Vif (viral infectivity factor) is a protein that is essential for the replication of the HIV-1 virus. The key function of Vif is to disrupt the antiviral activity of host APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3) proteins, which mutate viral nucleic acids. Inside the cell, Vif binds to the host cell proteins Elongin-C, Elongin-B, and core-binding factor subunit β, forming a four-protein complex called VCBC. The structure of VCBC-Cullin5 has recently been solved by X-ray crystallography, and, using molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of VCBC have been characterized. Here, we applied time-lapse high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize the conformational changes of the VCBC complex. We determined the three most favorable conformations of this complex, which we identified as the triangle, dumbbell, and globular structures. Moreover, we characterized the dynamics of each of these structures. Our data revealed the very dynamic behavior of all of them, with the triangle and dumbbell structures being the most dynamic. These findings provide insight into the structure and dynamics of the VCBC complex and may support efforts to improve HIV treatment, because Vif is essential for virus survival in the cell."	0
"32521277"	"Heterogeneous Habenular Neuronal Ensembles during Selection of Defensive Behaviors.Optimal selection of threat-driven defensive behaviors is paramount to an animal's survival. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a key neuronal hub coordinating behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. Yet, how individual LHb neurons represent defensive behaviors in response to threats remains unknown. Here, we show that in mice, a visual threat promotes distinct defensive behaviors, namely runaway (escape) and action-locking (immobile-like). Fiber photometry of bulk LHb neuronal activity in behaving animals reveals an increase and a decrease in calcium signal time-locked with runaway and action-locking, respectively. Imaging single-cell calcium dynamics across distinct threat-driven behaviors identify independently active LHb neuronal clusters. These clusters participate during specific time epochs of defensive behaviors. Decoding analysis of this neuronal activity reveals that some LHb clusters either predict the upcoming selection of the defensive action or represent the selected action. Thus, heterogeneous neuronal clusters in LHb predict or reflect the selection of distinct threat-driven defensive behaviors."	0

Here, we show that a lncRNA, MORRBID, a selective transcriptional repressor of BIM, is overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is associated with poor overall survival. In both human and animal models, MORRBID hyperactivation correlates with two recurrent AML drivers, TET2 and FLT3<sup>ITD</sup>. Mice with individual mutations of Tet2 or Flt3<sup>ITD</sup> develop features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), respectively, and combined presence results in AML. We observe increased levels of Morrbid in murine models of CMML, MPN, and AML.

"32905777"	"Hypoxia Triggers the Intravasation of Clustered Circulating Tumor Cells.Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from solid cancers in the form of single or clustered cells, and the latter display an extraordinary ability to initiate metastasis. Yet, the biological phenomena that trigger the shedding of CTC clusters from a primary cancerous lesion are poorly understood. Here, when dynamically labeling breast cancer cells along cancer progression, we observe that the majority of CTC clusters are undergoing hypoxia, while single CTCs are largely normoxic. Strikingly, we find that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting leads to primary tumor shrinkage, but it increases intra-tumor hypoxia, resulting in a higher CTC cluster shedding rate and metastasis formation. Conversely, pro-angiogenic treatment increases primary tumor size, yet it dramatically suppresses the formation of CTC clusters and metastasis. Thus, intra-tumor hypoxia leads to the formation of clustered CTCs with high metastatic ability, and a pro-angiogenic therapy suppresses metastasis formation through prevention of CTC cluster generation."	0
"32433967"	"Human Glial Progenitor Cells Effectively Remyelinate the Demyelinated Adult Brain.Neonatally transplanted human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) can myelinate the brains of myelin-deficient shiverer mice, rescuing their phenotype and survival. Yet, it has been unclear whether implanted hGPCs are similarly able to remyelinate the diffusely demyelinated adult CNS. We, therefore, ask if hGPCs could remyelinate both congenitally hypomyelinated adult shiverers and normal adult mice after cuprizone demyelination. In adult shiverers, hGPCs broadly disperse and differentiate as myelinating oligodendrocytes after subcortical injection, improving both host callosal conduction and ambulation. Implanted hGPCs similarly remyelinate denuded axons after cuprizone demyelination, whether delivered before or after demyelination. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hGPCs back from cuprizone-demyelinated brains reveals their transcriptional activation of oligodendrocyte differentiation programs, while distinguishing them from hGPCs not previously exposed to demyelination.

By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identify the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity of satellite cells, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression, during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies, we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal.

While TOP2ccs are normally reversible, they can be ""trapped"" by chemotherapeutic drugs such as etoposide and subsequently converted into irreversible TOP2-linked DSBs. Here, we have quantified etoposide-induced trapping of TOP2ccs, their conversion into irreversible TOP2-linked DSBs, and their processing during DNA repair genome-wide, as a function of time. We find that while TOP2 chromatin localization and trapping is independent of transcription, it requires pre-existing binding of cohesin to DNA. In contrast, the conversion of trapped TOP2ccs to irreversible DSBs during DNA repair is accelerated 2-fold at transcribed loci relative to non-transcribed loci. This conversion is dependent on proteasomal degradation and TDP2 phosphodiesterase activity. Quantitative modeling shows that only two features of pre-existing chromatin structure-namely, cohesin binding and transcriptional activity-can be used to predict the kinetics of TOP2-induced DSBs."	0

"32209462"	"Transcription Factor Binding to Replicated DNA.Genome replication perturbs the DNA regulatory environment by displacing DNA-bound proteins, replacing nucleosomes, and introducing dosage imbalance between regions replicating at different S-phase stages. Recently, we showed that these effects are integrated to maintain transcription homeostasis: replicated genes increase in dosage, but their expression remains stable due to replication-dependent epigenetic changes that suppress transcription. Here, we examine whether reduced transcription from replicated DNA results from limited accessibility to regulatory factors by measuring the time-resolved binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA during S phase in budding yeast. We show that the Pol II binding pattern is largely insensitive to DNA dosage, indicating limited binding to replicated DNA. In contrast, binding of three TFs (Reb1, Abf1, and Rap1) to DNA increases with the increasing DNA dosage. We conclude that the replication-specific chromatin environment remains accessible to regulatory factors but suppresses RNA polymerase recruitment."	0

Their intrinsic regulators and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that Wdr47 is a key polarization regulator. Wdr47-deficient newborn mice die of suffocation due to central nervous system defects including axonal tracts agenesis and slowed radial migration. Wdr47 deficiency represses the multipolar-bipolar transition of cortical neurons, reduces neurite tip-directed microtubule dynamics, and causes multi-axon formation. Overexpression of Wdr47 in wild-type neurons inhibits axon specification and neutralizes Taxol-induced neurite overgrowth and axon overproduction. Wdr47 interacts with the Camsap family of microtubule minus-end-binding proteins; associates with microtubules through Camsap3, whose gene disruption also causes multi-axons; and promotes Camsap3 accumulation in neurites of unpolarized neurons. Furthermore, Camsap overexpression rescues the polarization defects of Wdr47-deficient neurons. Our results indicate that Wdr47 facilitates proper neurite remodeling through Camsaps to fine-tune regional microtubule dynamics and organization during early stages of neuronal polarization."	0

Disruption of autophagy in CySCs and early cyst cells (CCs) by the depletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes reduced early CC numbers and affected CC function, resembling decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Indeed, our data indicate that EGFR acts to stimulate autophagy to preserve early CC function, whereas target of rapamycin (TOR) negatively regulates autophagy in the differentiating CCs. Finally, we show that the EGFR-mediated stimulation of autophagy regulates lipid levels in CySCs and CCs.

Surprisingly, KAP1/TRIM28 uses a previously uncharacterized chromatin reader cassette to bind hypo-acetylated histone 4 tails at promoters, guaranteeing continuous progression of RNA Pol II entry to and exit from the pause state. Upon chromatin docking, KAP1 first associates with RNA Pol II and then recruits a pathway-specific transcription factor (SMAD2) in response to cognate ligands, enabling gene-selective CDK9-dependent pause release. This coupling mechanism is exploited by tumor cells to aberrantly sustain transcriptional programs commonly dysregulated in cancer patients.

Accumulating evidence supports that RBP architectural modularity and adaptability define the specificity of their interactions with RNA. However, how multiple RBDs recognize their cognate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences in concert remains poorly understood. Here, we use Upstream of N-Ras (Unr) as a model system to address this question. Although reported to contain five ssRNA-binding cold-shock domains (CSDs), we demonstrate that Unr includes an additional four CSDs that do not bind RNA (pseudo-RBDs) but are involved in mediating RNA tertiary structure specificity by reducing the conformational heterogeneity of Unr. Disrupting the interactions between canonical and non-canonical CSDs impacts RNA binding, Unr-mediated translation regulation, and the Unr-dependent RNA interactome. Taken together, our studies reveal a new paradigm in protein-RNA recognition, where interactions between RBDs and pseudo-RBDs select RNA tertiary structures, influence RNP assembly, and define target specificity."	0
"32783940"	"FOXK1 Participates in DNA Damage Response by Controlling 53BP1 Function.53BP1 plays a central role in dictating DNA repair choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), which is important for the sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) of BRCA1-deficient cancers. In this study, we show that FOXK1 associates with 53BP1 and regulates 53BP1-dependent functions. FOXK1-53BP1 interaction is significantly enhanced upon DNA damage during the S phase in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner, which reduces the association of 53BP1 with its downstream factors RIF1 and PTIP. Depletion of FOXK1 impairs DNA repair and induces compromised cell survival upon DNA damage. Overexpression of FOXK1 diminishes 53BP1 foci formation, which leads to resistance to PARPis and elevation of HR in BRCA1-deficient cells and decreased telomere fusion in TRF2-depleted cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that FOXK1 negatively regulates 53BP1 function by inhibiting 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, which alters the DSB-induced protein complexes centering on 53BP1 and thus influences DNA repair choice."	1

"32647007"	"Cathepsin A contributes to left ventricular remodeling by degrading extracellular superoxide dismutase in mice.In the heart, the serine carboxypeptidase cathepsin A (CatA) is distributed between lysosomes and the extracellular matrix (ECM). CatA-mediated degradation of extracellular peptides may contribute to ECM remodeling and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of CatA overexpression on LV remodeling. A proteomic analysis of the secretome of adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts upon digestion by CatA identified the extracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) as a novel substrate of CatA, which decreased EC-SOD abundance 5-fold. <i>In vitro</i>, both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts expressed and secreted CatA protein, and only cardiac fibroblasts expressed and secreted EC-SOD protein. Cardiomyocyte-specific CatA overexpression and increased CatA activity in the LV of transgenic mice (CatA-TG) reduced EC-SOD protein levels by 43%. Loss of EC-SOD-mediated antioxidative activity resulted in significant accumulation of superoxide radicals (WT, 4.54 μmol/mg tissue/min; CatA-TG, 8.62 μmol/mg tissue/min), increased inflammation, myocyte hypertrophy (WT, 19.8 μm; CatA-TG, 21.9 μm), cellular apoptosis, and elevated mRNA expression of hypertrophy-related and profibrotic marker genes, without affecting intracellular detoxifying proteins. In CatA-TG mice, LV interstitial fibrosis formation was enhanced by 19%, and the type I/type III collagen ratio was shifted toward higher abundance of collagen I fibers. Cardiac remodeling in CatA-TG was accompanied by an increased LV weight/body weight ratio and LV end diastolic volume (WT, 50.8 μl; CatA-TG, 61.9 μl). In conclusion, CatA-mediated EC-SOD reduction in the heart contributes to increased oxidative stress, myocyte hypertrophy, ECM remodeling, and inflammation, implicating CatA as a potential therapeutic target to prevent ventricular remodeling."	0

Here, we assess the tumorigenic capacity of constitutive-active FGFR1 (FGFR1<sup>K656E</sup>) with concomitant RB and P53 depletion in mouse lung. Our results reveal a context-dependent effect of FGFR1<sup>K656E</sup>: it impairs SCLC development from CGRP<sup>POS</sup> neuroendocrine (NE) cells, which are considered the major cell of origin of SCLC, whereas it promotes SCLC and low-grade NE bronchial lesions from tracheobronchial-basal cells. Moreover, FGFR1<sup>K656E</sup> induces lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) from most lung cell compartments. However, its expression is not sustained in LADC originating from CGRP<sup>POS</sup> cells. Therefore, cell context and tumor stage should be taken into account when considering FGFR1 inhibition as a therapeutic option."	0
"32521279"	"Rrp6 Moonlights in an RNA Exosome-Independent Manner to Promote Cell Survival and Gene Expression during Stress.The nuclear RNA exosome is essential for RNA processing and degradation. Here, we show that the exosome nuclear-specific subunit Rrp6p promotes cell survival during heat stress through the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, independently of its catalytic activity or association with the core exosome. Rrp6p exhibits negative genetic interactions with the Slt2/Mpk1p or Paf1p elongation factors required for expression of CWI genes during stress. Overexpression of Rrp6p or of its catalytically inactive or exosome-independent mutants can partially rescue the growth defect of the mpk1Δ mutant and stimulates expression of the Mpk1p target gene FKS2. The rrp6Δ and mpk1Δ mutants show similarities in deficient expression of CWI genes during heat shock, and overexpression of the CWI gene HSP150 can rescue the stress-induced lethality of the mpk1Δrp6Δ mutant. These results demonstrate that Rrp6p moonlights independently from the exosome to ensure proper expression of CWI genes and to promote cell survival during stress."	0
"31202576"	"Spatial Chromosome Folding and Active Transcription Drive DNA Fragility and Formation of Oncogenic MLL Translocations.How spatial chromosome organization influences genome integrity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) activities are enriched at chromatin loop anchors with high transcriptional activity. Recurrent DSBs occur at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin-bound sites at the bases of chromatin loops, and their frequency positively correlates with transcriptional output and directionality. The physiological relevance of this preferential positioning is indicated by the finding that genes recurrently translocating to drive leukemias are highly transcribed and are enriched at loop anchors. These genes accumulate DSBs at recurrent hotspots that give rise to chromosomal fusions relying on the activity of both TOP2 isoforms and on transcriptional elongation. We propose that transcription and 3D chromosome folding jointly pose a threat to genomic stability and are key contributors to the occurrence of genome rearrangements that drive cancer."	0
"32747476"	"FoxA factors: the chromatin key and doorstop essential for liver development and function.Pioneer factors are transcriptional regulators with the capacity to bind inactive regions of chromatin and induce changes in accessibility that underpin cell fate decisions. The FOXA family of transcription factors is well understood to have pioneer capacity. Indeed, researchers have uncovered numerous examples of FOXA-dependent epigenomic modulation in developmental and disease processes. Despite the presence of FOXA being essential for correct epigenetic patterning, the need for continued FOXA presence postchromatin modulation has been debated. In a recent study in this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Reizel and colleagues (pp. 1039-1050) show that the tissue-specific ablation of FOXA1/2/3 in the adult mouse liver results in the collapse of the epigenetic profile that maintains the hepatic gene expression profile. Thus, FOXA functions as a key, opening regions of chromatin during development, and as a doorstep, maintaining the established euchromatic structure in adult tissue."	0

Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses.

"30472189"	"Nucleosome Turnover Regulates Histone Methylation Patterns over the Genome.Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence."	0
"32079652"	"MDM2 and MDMX promote ferroptosis by PPARα-mediated lipid remodeling.MDM2 and MDMX, negative regulators of the tumor suppressor p53, can work separately and as a heteromeric complex to restrain p53's functions. MDM2 also has pro-oncogenic roles in cells, tissues, and animals that are independent of p53. There is less information available about p53-independent roles of MDMX or the MDM2-MDMX complex. We found that MDM2 and MDMX facilitate ferroptosis in cells with or without p53. Using small molecules, RNA interference reagents, and mutant forms of MDMX, we found that MDM2 and MDMX, likely working in part as a complex, normally facilitate ferroptotic death. We observed that MDM2 and MDMX alter the lipid profile of cells to favor ferroptosis. Inhibition of MDM2 or MDMX leads to increased levels of FSP1 protein and a consequent increase in the levels of coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>, an endogenous lipophilic antioxidant. This suggests that MDM2 and MDMX normally prevent cells from mounting an adequate defense against lipid peroxidation and thereby promote ferroptosis. Moreover, we found that PPARα activity is essential for MDM2 and MDMX to promote ferroptosis, suggesting that the MDM2-MDMX complex regulates lipids through altering PPARα activity. These findings reveal the complexity of cellular responses to MDM2 and MDMX and suggest that MDM2-MDMX inhibition might be useful for preventing degenerative diseases involving ferroptosis. Furthermore, they suggest that MDM2/MDMX amplification may predict sensitivity of some cancers to ferroptosis inducers."	0
"30639240"	"Mechanistic Insights into the cis- and trans-Acting DNase Activities of Cas12a.CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) is an RNA-guided DNA-cutting nuclease that has been repurposed for genome editing. Upon target DNA binding, Cas12a cleaves both the target DNA in cis and non-target single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in trans. To elucidate the molecular basis for both DNase cleavage modes, we performed structural and biochemical studies on Francisella novicida Cas12a. We show that guide RNA-target strand DNA hybridization conformationally activates Cas12a, triggering its trans-acting, non-specific, single-stranded DNase activity. In turn, cis cleavage of double-stranded DNA targets is a result of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent DNA duplex unwinding, electrostatic stabilization of the displaced non-target DNA strand, and ordered sequential cleavage of the non-target and target DNA strands. Cas12a releases the PAM-distal DNA cleavage product and remains bound to the PAM-proximal DNA cleavage product in a catalytically competent, trans-active state. Together, these results provide a revised model for the molecular mechanisms of both the cis- and the trans-acting DNase activities of Cas12a enzymes, enabling their further exploitation as genome editing tools."	0
"32697985"	"Maturational Changes in Mouse Cutaneous Touch and Piezo2-Mediated Mechanotransduction.The age of studied animals has a profound impact on experimental outcomes in animal-based research. In mice, age influences molecular, morphological, physiological, and behavioral parameters, particularly during rapid postnatal growth and maturation until adulthood (at 12 weeks of age). Despite this knowledge, most biomedical studies use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 12 weeks, raising concerns about reproducibility and potential masking of relevant age differences. Here, using mouse behavior and electrophysiology in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we reveal a decline in behavioral cutaneous touch sensitivity and Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction in vitro during mouse maturation but not thereafter. In addition, we identify distinct transcript changes in individual Piezo2-expressing mechanosensitive DRG neurons by combining electrophysiology with single-cell RNA sequencing (patch-seq). Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown maturational plasticity in cutaneous touch at the level of behavior, mechanotransduction, and transcripts."	0
"32268096"	"Structural Insights into the Mammalian Late-Stage Initiation Complexes.In higher eukaryotes, the mRNA sequence in the direct vicinity of the start codon, called the Kozak sequence (CRCCaugG, where R is a purine), is known to influence the rate of the initiation process.

Our high-resolution structures unravel key interactions from the mRNA to eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs): 1A, 2, 3, 18S rRNA, and several 40S ribosomal proteins. In addition, we are able to study the structural role of ABCE1 in the formation of native 48S ICs.

"31519522"	"Elongation Factor TFIIS Prevents Transcription Stress and R-Loop Accumulation to Maintain Genome Stability.Although correlations between RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription stress, R-loops, and genome instability have been established, the mechanisms underlying these connections remain poorly understood. Here, we used a mutant version of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS (TFIIS<sub>mut</sub>), aiming to specifically induce increased levels of RNAPII pausing, arrest, and/or backtracking in human cells. Indeed, TFIIS<sub>mut</sub> expression results in slower elongation rates, relative depletion of polymerases from the end of genes, and increased levels of stopped RNAPII; it affects mRNA splicing and termination as well. Remarkably, TFIIS<sub>mut</sub> expression also dramatically increases R-loops, which may form at the anterior end of backtracked RNAPII and trigger genome instability, including DNA strand breaks. These results shed light on the relationship between transcription stress and R-loops and suggest that different classes of R-loops may exist, potentially with distinct consequences for genome stability."	0
"30922844"	"A Role for Chromatin Remodeling in Cohesin Loading onto Chromosomes.Cohesin is a conserved, ring-shaped protein complex that topologically embraces DNA. Its central role in genome organization includes functions in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Cohesin loading onto chromosomes requires the Scc2-Scc4 cohesin loader, whose presence on chromatin in budding yeast depends on the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. Here we reveal a dual role of RSC in cohesin loading. RSC acts as a chromatin receptor that recruits Scc2-Scc4 by a direct protein interaction independent of chromatin remodeling. In addition, chromatin remodeling is required to generate a nucleosome-free region that is the substrate for cohesin loading. An engineered cohesin loading module can be created by fusing the Scc2 C terminus to RSC or to other chromatin remodelers, but not to unrelated DNA binding proteins. These observations demonstrate the importance of nucleosome-free DNA for cohesin loading and provide insight into how cohesin accesses DNA during its varied chromosomal activities."	0

To evade immune control, HCMV evolved numerous antagonists targeting the interferon system at multiple levels. By comparative analysis of naturally arising variants of the most widely studied HCMV strain, AD169, and a panel of targeted mutants, we uncover the UL145 gene as indispensable for STAT2 downregulation. Ribosome profiling confirms the translation of the canonical pUL145 protein (pUL145-Long) and newly identifies a shorter isoform (pUL145-Short). Both isoforms recruit DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligases to induce proteasomal degradation of STAT2. An alanine-scanning mutagenesis discloses the DDB1 interaction motif of pUL145 that resembles the DDB1-binding interface of cellular substrate receptors of DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligases. Thus, pUL145 constitutes a viral DDB1-cullin-associated factor (vDCAF), which mimics cellular DCAFs to exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome system to impede antiviral immunity. Notably, the viral exploitation of the cullins can be targeted to restore the efficacy of the host immune response."	0

Here, through a mini-screen, we identified the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 2 (ORP2) as a novel mediator of selective cholesterol delivery to the PM. Interestingly, ORP2-mediated enrichment of PM cholesterol was coupled with the removal of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) from the PM. ORP2 overexpression or deficiency impacted the levels of PM cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and ORP2 efficiently transferred both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>in vitro. We determined the structure of ORP2 in complex with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at 2.7 Å resolution.

Notably, these behavioral effects are caused by direct central GLP-1R activation. Herein, we describe the creation of a GLP-1R agonist conjugate with modified brain penetrance that enhances GLP-1R-mediated glycemic control without inducing vomiting. Covalent attachment of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex4) to dicyanocobinamide (Cbi), a corrin ring containing precursor of vitamin B12, produces a ""corrinated"" Ex4 construct (Cbi-Ex4). Data collected in the musk shrew (Suncus murinus), an emetic mammal, reveal beneficial effects of Cbi-Ex4 relative to Ex4, as evidenced by improvements in glycemic responses in glucose tolerance tests and a profound reduction of emetic events.

"32641497"	"A functional role for eicosanoid-lysophospholipids in activating monocyte signaling.Recently, eicosanoid-lysophospholipids were identified as novel metabolites generated from the direct cyclooxygenase- or lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids produced from either phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>-mediated hydrolysis of diacyl arachidonoyl-phospholipids or through the cytochrome <i>c</i>-catalyzed oxidative hydrolysis of the vinyl ether linkage of arachidonoyl-plasmalogens. Although the metabolic pathways generating eicosanoid-lysophospholipids have been increasingly appreciated, the signaling functions of eicosanoid-lysophospholipids remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that 2-12(<i>S</i>)-HETE-lysophospholipids as well as nonesterified 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE are potent lipid mediators that activate THP-1 human monocytic cells to generate tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 8 (IL8). Remarkably, low nanomolar concentrations of 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE-lysophospholipids, but not other oxidized signaling lipids examined activated THP-1 cells resulting in the production of large amounts of TNFα. Moreover, TNFα release induced by 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE-lysophospholipids was inhibited by the TNFα converting enzyme inhibitor TAPI-0 indicating normal processing of TNFα in THP-1 cells stimulated with these agonists. Western blotting analyses revealed that 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE-lysophospholipids activated the phosphorylation of NFκB p65, suggesting activation of the canonical NFκB signaling pathway. Importantly, activation of THP-1 cells to release TNFα was stereoselective with 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE favored over 12(<i>R</i>)-HETE. Furthermore, the EC<sub>50</sub> of 2-12(<i>S</i>)-HETE-lysophosphatidylcholine in activating THP-1 cells was 2.1 nm, whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> of free 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE was 23 nm Additionally, lipid extracts of activated platelets were separated by RP-HPLC demonstrating the coelution of 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE with fractions initiating TNFα release.

Instead, we found that TA and EGCG mainly acted as fluorescence quenchers that rapidly suppress the fluorophores conjugated to annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-binding probe commonly used to report on TMEM16 CaPLSase activity. These data demonstrate the false positive effects of TA and EGCG on inhibiting TMEM16F phospholipid scrambling and discourage the use of these polyphenols as CaPLSase inhibitors.

Here we mapped GR's chromatin occupancy in mouse livers throughout the day and night cycle. We show how GR partitions metabolic processes by time-dependent target gene regulation and controls circulating glucose and triglycerides differentially during feeding and fasting. Highlighting the dominant role GR plays in synchronizing circadian amplitudes, we find that the majority of oscillating genes are bound by and depend on GR. This rhythmic pattern is altered by high-fat diet in a ligand-independent manner. We find that the remodeling of oscillatory gene expression and postprandial GR binding results from a concomitant increase of STAT5 co-occupancy in obese mice.

We investigate, in fission yeast, telomere replication dynamics in telomerase-negative cells to unmask problems associated with telomere replication. Two-dimensional gel analysis reveals that replication of telomeres is severely impaired and correlates with an accumulation of replication intermediates that arises from stalled and collapsed forks. In the absence of telomerase, Rad51, Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, and its co-factor CtIP<sup>Ctp1</sup> become critical to maintain telomeres, indicating that homologous recombination processes these intermediates to facilitate fork restart. We further show that a catalytically dead mutant of telomerase prevents Ku recruitment to telomeres, suggesting that telomerase and Ku both compete for the binding of telomeric-free DNA ends that are likely to originate from a reversed fork. We infer that Ku removal at collapsed telomeric forks allows telomerase to repair broken telomeres, thereby shielding telomeres from homologous recombination."	0

EChO shows that multiple individual TFs can employ either direct DNA binding or ""pioneer"" nucleosome binding at different enhancer targets. Nucleosome binding is not exclusively confined to inaccessible chromatin but rather correlated with local binding of other TFs and degeneracy at key bases in the pioneer factor target motif responsible for direct DNA binding.

Here, we investigate the effects of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid present at high amounts in fat-rich diets, in the brain. Palmitate is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of overweight and obese patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In mice, intracerebroventricular infusion of palmitate impairs synaptic plasticity and memory. Palmitate induces astroglial and microglial activation in the mouse hippocampus, and its deleterious impact is mediated by microglia-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling. Our results establish that obesity is associated with increases in CSF palmitate. By defining a pro-inflammatory mechanism by which abnormal levels of palmitate in the brain impair memory, the results further suggest that anti-inflammatory strategies may attenuate memory impairment in obesity."	0
"30954402"	"DNA Damage Signaling-Induced Cancer Cell Reprogramming as a Driver of Tumor Relapse.Accumulating evidence supports the role of the DNA damage response (DDR) in the negative regulation of tumorigenesis. Here, we found that DDR signaling poises a series of epigenetic events, resulting in activation of pro-tumorigenic genes but can go as far as reactivation of the pluripotency gene OCT4. Loss of DNA methylation appears to be a key initiating event in DDR-dependent OCT4 locus reactivation although full reactivation required the presence of a driving oncogene, such as Myc and macroH2A downregulation. Using genetic-lineage-tracing experiments and an in situ labeling approach, we show that DDR-induced epigenetic reactivation of OCT4 regulates the resistance to chemotherapy and contributes to tumor relapse both in mouse and primary human cancers. In turn, deletion of OCT4 reverses chemoresistance and delays the relapse. Here, we uncovered an unexpected tumor-promoting role of DDR in cancer cell reprogramming, providing novel therapeutic entry points for cancer intervention strategies."	0
"32402292"	"Cerebellospinal Neurons Regulate Motor Performance and Motor Learning.To understand the neural basis of behavior, it is important to reveal how movements are planned, executed, and refined by networks of neurons distributed throughout the nervous system. Here, we report the neuroanatomical organization and behavioral roles of cerebellospinal (CeS) neurons. Using intersectional genetic techniques, we find that CeS neurons constitute a small minority of excitatory neurons in the fastigial and interpositus deep cerebellar nuclei, target pre-motor circuits in the ventral spinal cord and the brain, and control distinct aspects of movement. CeS neurons that project to the ipsilateral cervical cord are required for skilled forelimb performance, while CeS neurons that project to the contralateral cervical cord are involved in skilled locomotor learning. Together, this work establishes CeS neurons as a critical component of the neural circuitry for skilled movements and provides insights into the organizational logic of motor networks."	0
"32451439"	"ROCK-mediated selective activation of PERK signalling causes fibroblast reprogramming and tumour progression through a CRELD2-dependent mechanism.It is well accepted that cancers co-opt the microenvironment for their growth. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer-microenvironment interactions are still poorly defined. Here, we show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the mammary tumour epithelium selectively actuates protein-kinase-R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), causing the recruitment and persistent education of tumour-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are part of the cancer microenvironment. An analysis of tumours from patients and mice reveals that cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (CRELD2) is the paracrine factor that underlies PERK-mediated CAF education downstream of ROCK. We find that CRELD2 is regulated by PERK-regulated ATF4, and depleting CRELD2 suppressed tumour progression, demonstrating that the paracrine ROCK-PERK-ATF4-CRELD2 axis promotes the progression of breast cancer, with implications for cancer therapy."	1
"32303635"	"Transcriptome profiling and protease inhibition experiments identify proteases that activate H3N2 influenza A and influenza B viruses in murine airways.Cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is essential for virus infectivity. HA of most influenza A and B (IAV/IBV) viruses is cleaved at a monobasic motif by trypsin-like proteases. Previous studies have reported that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for activation of H7N9 and H1N1pdm IAV in mice but that H3N2 IAV and IBV activation is independent of TMPRSS2 and carried out by as-yet-undetermined protease(s). Here, to identify additional H3 IAV- and IBV-activating proteases, we used RNA-Seq to investigate the protease repertoire of murine lower airway tissues, primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs), and the mouse lung cell line MLE-15. Among 13 candidates identified, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13, hepsin, and prostasin activated H3 and IBV HA <i>in vitro</i> IBV activation and replication was reduced in AECIIs from <i>Tmprss2/Tmprss4</i>-deficient mice compared with WT or Tmprss2-deficient mice, indicating that murine TMPRSS4 is involved in IBV activation. Multicycle replication of H3N2 IAV and IBV in AECIIs of <i>Tmprss2/Tmprss4</i>-deficient mice varied in sensitivity to protease inhibitors, indicating that different, but overlapping, sets of murine proteases facilitate H3 and IBV HA cleavages. Interestingly, human hepsin and prostasin orthologs did not activate H3, but they did activate IBV HA <i>in vitro</i> Our results indicate that TMPRSS4 is an IBV-activating protease in murine AECIIs and suggest that TMPRSS13, hepsin, and prostasin cleave H3 and IBV HA in mice. They further show that hepsin and prostasin orthologs might contribute to the differences observed in TMPRSS2-independent activation of H3 in murine and human airways."	0
"32320646"	"Inducible Degradation of the Human SMC5/6 Complex Reveals an Essential Role Only during Interphase.The cohesin- and condensin-related SMC5/6 complex has largely been studied in the context of DNA repair. Nevertheless, SMC5/6 has an undefined essential function even in the absence of cellular stress. Through the use of an auxin-inducible degradation system for rapidly depleting subunits of the SMC5/6 complex, we show that SMC5/6 is essential for viability in cancer-derived and normal human cells. Impairment of SMC5/6 function is associated with spontaneous induction of DNA damage, p53 activation, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence, as well as an increased frequency of various mitotic chromosome segregation abnormalities. However, we show that this chromosome missegregation is apparent only when SMC5/6 function is impaired during the preceding S and G2 phases. In contrast, degradation of SMC5/6 immediately prior to mitotic entry has little or no impact on the fidelity of chromosome segregation, highlighting the importance of the complex during interphase in order to ensure faithful sister chromatid disjunction."	0

To identify factors that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin, we affinity-selected solubilized fission yeast CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin. All subunits of the Ino80 complex were enriched, including the auxiliary subunit Hap2. Chromatin association of Hap2 is Ies4-dependent. In addition to a role in maintenance of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin integrity at endogenous centromeres, Hap2 is required for de novo assembly of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin on naïve centromere DNA and promotes H3 turnover on centromere regions and other loci prone to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> deposition. Prior to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin assembly, Hap2 facilitates transcription from centromere DNA. These analyses suggest that Hap2-Ino80 destabilizes H3 nucleosomes on centromere DNA through transcription-coupled histone H3 turnover, driving the replacement of resident H3 nucleosomes with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes. These inherent properties define centromere DNA by directing a program that mediates CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> assembly on appropriate sequences."	0

We investigated how alterations in αS or lipid/fatty acid homeostasis affect each other. Lipidomic profiling of human αS-expressing yeast revealed increases in oleic acid (OA, 18:1), diglycerides, and triglycerides. These findings were recapitulated in rodent and human neuronal models of αS dyshomeostasis (overexpression; patient-derived triplication or E46K mutation; E46K mice). Preventing lipid droplet formation or augmenting OA increased αS yeast toxicity; suppressing the OA-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) was protective. Genetic or pharmacological SCD inhibition ameliorated toxicity in αS-overexpressing rat neurons. In a C. elegans model, SCD knockout prevented αS-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Conversely, we observed detrimental effects of OA on αS homeostasis: in human neural cells, excess OA caused αS inclusion formation, which was reversed by SCD inhibition. Thus, monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism is pivotal for αS-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibiting SCD represents a novel PD therapeutic approach."	0
"30595438"	"Temperature-Responsive Competitive Inhibition of CRISPR-Cas9.CRISPR-Cas immune systems utilize RNA-guided nucleases to protect bacteria from bacteriophage infection. Bacteriophages have in turn evolved inhibitory ""anti-CRISPR"" (Acr) proteins, including six inhibitors (AcrIIA1-AcrIIA6) that can block DNA cutting and genome editing by type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes. We show here that AcrIIA2 and its more potent homolog, AcrIIA2b, prevent Cas9 binding to DNA by occluding protein residues required for DNA binding. Cryo-EM-determined structures of AcrIIA2 or AcrIIA2b bound to S. pyogenes Cas9 reveal a mode of competitive inhibition of DNA binding that is distinct from other known Acrs. Differences in the temperature dependence of Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA2b arise from differences in both inhibitor structure and the local inhibitor-binding environment on Cas9. These findings expand the natural toolbox for regulating CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing temporally, spatially, and conditionally."	0
"31757755"	"A Non-amyloid Prion Particle that Activates a Heritable Gene Expression Program.Spatiotemporal gene regulation is often driven by RNA-binding proteins that harbor long intrinsically disordered regions in addition to folded RNA-binding domains. We report that the disordered region of the evolutionarily ancient developmental regulator Vts1/Smaug drives self-assembly into gel-like condensates. These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid, yet they are infectious, allowing them to act as a protein-based epigenetic element: a prion [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. Our data establish that non-amyloid self-assembly of RNA-binding proteins can drive a form of epigenetics beyond the chromosome, instilling adaptive gene expression programs that are heritable over long biological timescales."	0
"32738194"	"Quality Control of ER Membrane Proteins by the RNF185/Membralin Ubiquitin Ligase Complex.Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although ERAD components involved in degradation of luminal substrates are well characterized, much less is known about quality control of membrane proteins. Here, we analyzed the degradation pathways of two short-lived ER membrane model proteins in mammalian cells. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide library screen, we identified an ERAD branch required for quality control of a subset of membrane proteins. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches, we showed that this ERAD branch is defined by an ER membrane complex consisting of the ubiquitin ligase RNF185, the ubiquitin-like domain containing proteins TMUB1/2 and TMEM259/Membralin, a poorly characterized protein. This complex cooperates with cytosolic ubiquitin ligase UBE3C and p97 ATPase in degrading their membrane substrates. Our data reveal that ERAD branches have remarkable specificity for their membrane substrates, suggesting that multiple, perhaps combinatorial, determinants are involved in substrate selection."	1
"31630969"	"An Early mtUPR: Redistribution of the Nuclear Transcription Factor Rox1 to Mitochondria Protects against Intramitochondrial Proteotoxic Aggregates.The mitochondrial proteome is built mainly by import of nuclear-encoded precursors, which are targeted mostly by cleavable presequences. Presequence processing upon import is essential for proteostasis and survival, but the consequences of dysfunctional protein maturation are unknown. We find that impaired presequence processing causes accumulation of precursors inside mitochondria that form aggregates, which escape degradation and unexpectedly do not cause cell death. Instead, cells survive via activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-like pathway that is triggered very early after precursor accumulation. In contrast to classical stress pathways, this immediate response maintains mitochondrial protein import, membrane potential, and translation through translocation of the nuclear HMG-box transcription factor Rox1 to mitochondria. Rox1 binds mtDNA and performs a TFAM-like function pivotal for transcription and translation. Induction of early mtUPR provides a reversible stress model to mechanistically dissect the initial steps in mtUPR pathways with the stressTFAM Rox1 as the first line of defense."	0

"32075734"	"Regulatory Dynamics of Tet1 and Oct4 Resolve Stages of Global DNA Demethylation and Transcriptomic Changes in Reprogramming.Reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) involves the reactivation of endogenous pluripotency genes and global DNA demethylation, but temporal resolution of these events using existing markers is limited. Here, we generate murine transgenic lines harboring reporters for the 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1 and for Oct4. By monitoring dual reporter fluorescence during pluripotency entry, we identify a sequential order of Tet1 and Oct4 activation by proximal and distal regulatory elements. Full Tet1 activation marks an intermediate stage that accompanies predominantly repression of somatic genes, preceding full Oct4 activation, and distinguishes two waves of global DNA demethylation that target distinct genomic features but are uncoupled from transcriptional changes. Tet1 knockout shows that TET1 contributes to both waves of demethylation and activates germline regulatory genes in reprogramming intermediates but is dispensable for Oct4 reactivation. Our dual reporter system for time-resolving pluripotency entry thus refines the molecular roadmap of iPSC maturation."	0

Although Pol II is a complex, 12-subunit enzyme, it lacks the ability to initiate transcription and cannot consistently transcribe through long DNA sequences. To execute these essential functions, an array of proteins and protein complexes interact with Pol II to regulate its activity. In this review, we detail the structure and mechanism of over a dozen factors that govern Pol II initiation (e.g., TFIID, TFIIH, and Mediator), pausing, and elongation (e.g., DSIF, NELF, PAF, and P-TEFb). The structural basis for Pol II transcription regulation has advanced rapidly in the past decade, largely due to technological innovations in cryoelectron microscopy. Here, we summarize a wealth of structural and functional data that have enabled a deeper understanding of Pol II transcription mechanisms; we also highlight mechanistic questions that remain unanswered or controversial."	0
"32690608"	"Ozone-derived oxysterols impair lung macrophage phagocytosis via adduction of some phagocytosis receptors.Inhalation of the ambient air pollutant ozone causes lung inflammation and can suppress host defense mechanisms, including impairing macrophage phagocytosis. Ozone reacts with cholesterol in the lung to form oxysterols, like secosterol A and secosterol B (SecoA and SecoB), which can form covalent adducts on cellular proteins. How oxysterol-protein adduction modifies the function of lung macrophages is unknown. Herein, we used a proteomic screen to identify lung macrophage proteins that form adducts with ozone-derived oxysterols. Functional ontology analysis of the adductome indicated that protein binding was a major function of adducted proteins. Further analysis of specific proteins forming adducts with SecoA identified the phagocytic receptors CD206 and CD64. Adduction of these receptors with ozone-derived oxysterols impaired ligand binding and corresponded with reduced macrophage phagocytosis. This work suggests a novel mechanism for the suppression of macrophage phagocytosis following ozone exposure through the generation of oxysterols and the formation of oxysterol-protein adducts on phagocytic receptors."	0

Oral administration of a Ganoderma meroterpene derivative (GMD) ameliorates nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in the liver of fa/fa rats by reducing endotoxemia, enhancing lipid oxidation, decreasing de novo lipogenesis, and suppressing lipid export from the liver. An altered gut microbiota with an increase of butyrate and folate plays a causative role in the effects of GMD. The commensal bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides uniformis, which are enriched by GMD, are major contributors to the increased gut folate.

"30824373"	"Fuzzy Interactions Form and Shape the Histone Transport Complex.Protein transport into the nucleus is mediated by transport receptors. Import of highly charged proteins, such as histone H1 and ribosomal proteins, requires a dimer of two transport receptors. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the Imp7:Impβ:H1.0 complex, showing that the two importins form a cradle that accommodates the linker histone. The H1.0 globular domain is bound to Impβ, whereas the acidic loops of Impβ and Imp7 chaperone the positively charged C-terminal tail. Although it remains disordered, the H1 tail serves as a zipper that closes and stabilizes the structure through transient non-specific interactions with importins. Moreover, we found that the GGxxF and FxFG motifs in the Imp7 C-terminal tail are essential for Imp7:Impβ dimerization and H1 import, resembling importin interaction with nucleoporins, which, in turn, promote complex disassembly. The architecture of many other complexes might be similarly defined by rapidly exchanging electrostatic interactions mediated by disordered regions."	0

We find that EAPs in deep structures of the brain exhibit robust and systematic variability during the cardiac cycle. These cardiac-related features refine neural classification. We use these features to link bio-realistic models generated from in vitro human whole-cell recordings of morphologically classified neurons to in vivo recordings. We differentiate aspiny inhibitory and spiny excitatory human hippocampal neurons and, in a second stage, demonstrate that cardiac-motion features reveal two types of spiny neurons with distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties and phase-locking characteristics to endogenous oscillations.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell state in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. Pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analyses predict a quasi-linear differentiation hierarchy where basal cells progress from Col17a1<sup>Hi</sup>/Trp63<sup>Hi</sup> state to early-response state, proliferate at the juncture of these two states, or become growth arrested before differentiating into spinous cells.

Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of <i>in vitro</i> tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies."	0

To understand how cell-specific gene expression patterns are generated, we study the developmental timing of association of two prominent hepatic transcription factors with gene regulatory regions. Most individual binding events display extraordinarily high temporal variations during liver development. Early and persistent binding is necessary, but not sufficient, for gene activation. Stable gene expression patterns are the result of combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors, which mark regulatory regions long before activation and promote progressive broadening of active chromatin domains. Both temporally stable and dynamic, short-lived binding events contribute to the developmental maturation of active promoter configurations.

"31735643"	"Dynamic Regulation of ME1 Phosphorylation and Acetylation Affects Lipid Metabolism and Colorectal Tumorigenesis.PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis."	1

"32268122"	"Differentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are critical for continued cellular replacement in the adult brain. Lifelong maintenance of a functional NSPC pool necessitates stringent mechanisms to preserve a pristine proteome. We find that the NSPC chaperone network robustly maintains misfolded protein solubility and stress resilience through high levels of the ATP-dependent chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Strikingly, NSPC differentiation rewires the cellular chaperone network, reducing TRiC/CCT levels and inducing those of the ATP-independent small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). This switches the proteostasis strategy in neural progeny cells to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into protective inclusions. The chaperone network of NSPCs is more effective than that of differentiated cells, leading to improved management of proteotoxic stress and amyloidogenic proteins. However, NSPC proteostasis is impaired by brain aging. The less efficient chaperone network of differentiated neural progeny may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation."	0
"32877678"	"ATR Restrains DNA Synthesis and Mitotic Catastrophe in Response to CDC7 Inhibition.DNA replication initiates from multiple origins, and selective CDC7 kinase inhibitors (CDC7is) restrain cell proliferation by limiting origin firing. We have performed a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screen to identify genes that, when lost, promote the proliferation of cells treated with sub-efficacious doses of a CDC7i. We have found that the loss of function of ETAA1, an ATR activator, and RIF1 reduce the sensitivity to CDC7is by allowing DNA synthesis to occur more efficiently, notably during late S phase. We show that partial CDC7 inhibition induces ATR mainly through ETAA1, and that if ATR is subsequently inhibited, origin firing is unleashed in a CDK- and CDC7-dependent manner. Cells are then driven into a premature and highly defective mitosis, a phenotype that can be recapitulated by ETAA1 and TOPBP1 co-depletion.

We identify remarkable usage of non-canonical cysteines within the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-H3) and other CDRs and framework regions. Furthermore, our study reveals the diversity and location of non-canonical cysteines and their associated motifs in human V<sub>H</sub>s, which are reminiscent of and more complex than those found in other non-human species such as chicken, camel, llama, shark, and cow. These results explain how non-canonical cysteines strategically occur in the human antibodyome to expand its paratope space. This study will guide the design of human antibodies harboring disulfide-stabilized long CDR-H3s to access difficult-to-target epitopes and influence a paradigm shift in developability involving non-canonical cysteines."	0
"32518161"	"Loss of the RNA-binding protein Rbm15 disrupts liver maturation in zebrafish.Liver organogenesis begins with hepatic precursors in the foregut endoderm, followed by hepatoblast specification, differentiation, outgrowth, and maturation for the formation of functional hepatocytes. Although several signaling pathways and critical factors that regulate liver specification, differentiation, and proliferation have been identified, little is known about how liver maturation is regulated. Here, we used a screen for mutations affecting liver development in zebrafish and identified a <i>cq96</i> mutant that exhibits a specific defect in liver maturation. Results from positional cloning revealed that <i>cq96</i> encodes an RNA-binding protein, Rbm15, which is an evolutionarily conserved Spen family protein and known to play a crucial role in RNA m6A modification, nuclear export, and alternative splicing. However, a function of Rbm15 in embryonic liver development has not been reported. We found that <i>Rbm15</i> is specifically expressed in the liver after its differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of <i>rbm15</i> repressed hepatic maturation, but did not affect hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in <i>rbm15</i>-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin treatment partially restored normal hepatic gene expression as well as the nuclear location of the transcription factor Hnf4a. Taken together, these results reveal an unexpected role of Rbm15 in liver maturation."	0
"32814043"	"Proteolytic Restriction of Chordin Range Underlies BMP Gradient Formation.A fundamental question in developmental biology is how morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), form precise signaling gradients to impart positional and functional identity to the cells of the early embryo. We combine rigorous mutant analyses with quantitative immunofluorescence to determine that the proteases Bmp1a and Tolloid spatially restrict the BMP antagonist Chordin in dorsoventral (DV) axial patterning of the early zebrafish gastrula. We show that maternally deposited Bmp1a plays an unexpected and non-redundant role in establishing the BMP signaling gradient, while the Bmp1a/Tolloid antagonist Sizzled is surprisingly dispensable. Combining computational modeling and in vivo analyses with an immobile Chordin construct, we demonstrate that long-range Chordin diffusion is not necessary for BMP gradient formation and DV patterning. Our data do not support a counter-gradient of Chordin and instead favor a Chordin sink, established by Bmp1a and Tolloid, as the primary mechanism that drives BMP gradient formation."	1
"32234471"	"Structure and Function of an Elongation Factor P Subfamily in Actinobacteria.Translation of consecutive proline motifs causes ribosome stalling and requires rescue via the action of a specific translation elongation factor, EF-P in bacteria and archaeal/eukaryotic a/eIF5A. In Eukarya, Archaea, and all bacteria investigated so far, the functionality of this translation elongation factor depends on specific and rather unusual post-translational modifications. The phylum Actinobacteria, which includes the genera Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and Streptomyces, is of both medical and economic significance. Here, we report that EF-P is required in these bacteria in particular for the translation of proteins involved in amino acid and secondary metabolite production. Notably, EF-P of Actinobacteria species does not need any post-translational modification for activation. While the function and overall 3D structure of this EF-P type is conserved, the loop containing the conserved lysine is flanked by two essential prolines that rigidify it. Actinobacteria's EF-P represents a unique subfamily that works without any modification."	0
"32783945"	"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Childhood Ependymoma Reveals Neoplastic Cell Subpopulations That Impact Molecular Classification and Etiology.Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity increases understanding of EPN biology."	0

We show that preventing the formation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes prevents the death of RGCs normally seen in a mouse model of glaucoma. Furthermore, we show that these spared RGCs are electrophysiologically functional and thus still have potential value for the function and regeneration of the retina. Finally, we demonstrate that the death of RGCs depends on a combination of both an injury to the neurons and the presence of reactive astrocytes, suggesting a model that may explain why reactive astrocytes are toxic only in some circumstances. Altogether, these findings highlight reactive astrocytes as drivers of RGC death in a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the eye."	0
"32553155"	"Synaptic Vesicle Precursors and Lysosomes Are Transported by Different Mechanisms in the Axon of Mammalian Neurons.BORC is a multisubunit complex previously shown to promote coupling of mammalian lysosomes and C. elegans synaptic vesicle (SV) precursors (SVPs) to kinesins for anterograde transport of these organelles along microtubule tracks. We attempted to meld these observations into a unified model for axonal transport in mammalian neurons by testing two alternative hypotheses: (1) that SV and lysosomal proteins are co-transported within a single type of ""lysosome-related vesicle"" and (2) that SVPs and lysosomes are distinct organelles, but both depend on BORC for axonal transport. Analyses of various types of neurons from wild-type rats and mice, as well as from BORC-deficient mice, show that neither hypothesis is correct. We find that SVPs and lysosomes are transported separately, but only lysosomes depend on BORC for axonal transport in these neurons. These findings demonstrate that SVPs and lysosomes are distinct organelles that rely on different machineries for axonal transport in mammalian neurons."	0
"32402276"	"S-phase Enriched Non-coding RNAs Regulate Gene Expression and Cell Cycle Progression.Many proteins that are needed for progression through S-phase are produced from transcripts that peak in the S-phase, linking temporal expression of those proteins to the time that they are required in cell cycle. Here, we explore the potential roles of long non-coding RNAs in cell cycle progression. We use a sensitive click-chemistry approach to isolate nascent RNAs in a human cell line, and we identify more than 900 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) whose synthesis peaks during the S-phase. More than 200 of these are long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) with S-phase-specific expression. We characterize three of these lincRNAs by knockdown and find that all three lincRNAs are required for appropriate S-phase progression. We infer that non-coding RNAs are key regulatory effectors during the cell cycle, acting on distinct regulatory networks, and herein, we provide a large catalog of candidate cell-cycle regulatory RNAs."	0
"32101752"	"Directed Differentiation of Notochord-like and Nucleus Pulposus-like Cells Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.Intervertebral disc degeneration might be amenable to stem cell therapy, but the required cells are scarce. Here, we report the development of a protocol for directed in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into notochord-like and nucleus pulposus (NP)-like cells of the disc. The first step combines enhancement of ACTIVIN/NODAL and WNT and inhibition of BMP pathways. By day 5 of differentiation, hPSC-derived cells express notochordal cell characteristic genes. After activating the TGF-β pathway for an additional 15 days, qPCR, immunostaining, and transcriptome data show that a wide array of NP markers are expressed. Transcriptomically, the in vitro-derived cells become more like in vivo adolescent human NP cells, driven by a set of influential genes enriched with motifs bound by BRACHYURY and FOXA2, consistent with an NP cell-like identity. Transplantation of these NP-like cells attenuates fibrotic changes in a rat disc injury model of disc degeneration."	0

Here, we study their differentiation pathways in relation with their sampling, migratory, and T cell-priming abilities. Among four identified LysoDC differentiation stages displaying similar phagocytic activity, one is located in follicles, and the others reside in subepithelial domes (SED), where they proliferate and mature as they get closer to the epithelium. Mature LysoDCs but not macrophages express a gene set in common with conventional dendritic cells and prime naive helper T cells in vitro. At steady state, they do not migrate into naive T cell-enriched interfollicular regions (IFRs), but upon stimulation, they express the chemokine receptor CCR7 and migrate from SED to the IFR periphery, where they strongly interact with proliferative immune cells. Finally, we show that LysoDCs populate human Peyer's patches, strengthening their interest as targets for modulating intestinal immunity."	0
"32620552"	"Phosphorylation on Ser-359 of the α2 subunit in GABA type A receptors down-regulates their density at inhibitory synapses.GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) mediate fast synaptic inhibition and are trafficked to functionally diverse synapses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition. The MS data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange, with the data set identifier PXD019597."	1
"32320649"	"The Set7 Lysine Methyltransferase Regulates Plasticity in Oxidative Phosphorylation Necessary for Trained Immunity Induced by β-Glucan.Trained immunity confers a sustained augmented response of innate immune cells to a secondary challenge, via a process dependent on metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. Because of its previous associations with metabolic and transcriptional memory, as well as the importance of H3 histone lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) to innate immune memory, we hypothesize that the Set7 methyltransferase has an important role in trained immunity induced by β-glucan. Using pharmacological studies of human primary monocytes, we identify trained immunity-specific immunometabolic pathways regulated by Set7, including a previously unreported H3K4me1-dependent plasticity in the induction of oxidative phosphorylation. Recapitulation of β-glucan training in vivo additionally identifies Set7-dependent changes in gene expression previously associated with the modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors in trained immunity. By revealing Set7 as a key regulator of trained immunity, these findings provide mechanistic insight into sustained metabolic changes and underscore the importance of characterizing regulatory circuits of innate immune memory."	0
"32268123"	"DNAJB6, a Key Factor in Neuronal Sensitivity to Amyloidogenesis.CAG-repeat expansions in at least eight different genes cause neurodegeneration. The length of the extended polyglutamine stretches in the corresponding proteins is proportionally related to their aggregation propensity. Although these proteins are ubiquitously expressed, they predominantly cause toxicity to neurons. To understand this neuronal hypersensitivity, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington's disease patients. iPSC generation and neuronal differentiation are unaffected by polyglutamine proteins and show no spontaneous aggregate formation. However, upon glutamate treatment, aggregates form in neurons but not in patient-derived neural progenitors. During differentiation, the chaperone network is drastically rewired, including loss of expression of the anti-amyloidogenic chaperone DNAJB6. Upregulation of DNAJB6 in neurons antagonizes glutamate-induced aggregation, while knockdown of DNAJB6 in progenitors results in spontaneous polyglutamine aggregation. Loss of DNAJB6 expression upon differentiation is confirmed in vivo, explaining why stem cells are intrinsically protected against amyloidogenesis and protein aggregates are dominantly present in neurons."	0
"30952514"	"Dynamic Recruitment of Single RNAs to Processing Bodies Depends on RNA Functionality.Cellular RNAs often colocalize with cytoplasmic, membrane-less ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules enriched for RNA-processing enzymes, termed processing bodies (PBs). Here we track the dynamic localization of individual miRNAs, mRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to PBs using intracellular single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We find that unused miRNAs stably bind to PBs, whereas functional miRNAs, repressed mRNAs, and lncRNAs both transiently and stably localize within either the core or periphery of PBs, albeit to different extents. Consequently, translation potential and 3' versus 5' placement of miRNA target sites significantly affect the PB localization dynamics of mRNAs. Using computational modeling and supporting experimental approaches, we show that partitioning in the PB phase attenuates mRNA silencing, suggesting that physiological mRNA turnover occurs predominantly outside of PBs. Instead, our data support a PB role in sequestering unused miRNAs for surveillance and provide a framework for investigating the dynamic assembly of RNP granules by phase separation at single-molecule resolution."	0
"31053471"	"PD-L1 (B7-H1) Competes with the RNA Exosome to Regulate the DNA Damage Response and Can Be Targeted to Sensitize to Radiation or Chemotherapy.Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1, also called B7-H1) is an immune checkpoint protein that inhibits immune function through its binding of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor. Clinically approved antibodies block extracellular PD-1 and PD-L1 binding, yet the role of intracellular PD-L1 in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we discovered that intracellular PD-L1 acts as an RNA binding protein that regulates the mRNA stability of NBS1, BRCA1, and other DNA damage-related genes. Through competition with the RNA exosome, intracellular PD-L1 protects targeted RNAs from degradation, thereby increasing cellular resistance to DNA damage. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA-seq experiments demonstrated that PD-L1 regulates RNA stability genome-wide. Furthermore, we developed a PD-L1 antibody, H1A, which abrogates the interaction of PD-L1 with CMTM6, thereby promoting PD-L1 degradation. Intracellular PD-L1 may be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in cancer through the inhibition of DNA damage response and repair."	0

In this study, using Xenopus laevis embryos and phosphoproteome analyses, we uncover the rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk2 upon stimulation with centrifugal, compression, or stretching force. We demonstrate that Erk2 induces the remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins, including F-actin, an embryonic cadherin C-cadherin, and the tight junction protein ZO-1. We show these force-dependent changes to be prerequisites for the enhancement of cellular junctions and tissue stiffening during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, Erk2 activation is FGFR1 dependent while not requiring fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands, suggesting that cell/tissue deformation triggers receptor activation in the absence of ligands. These findings establish previously unrecognized functions for mechanical forces in embryogenesis and reveal its underlying force-induced signaling pathways."	0
"30795893"	"Microscopy-Based Chromosome Conformation Capture Enables Simultaneous Visualization of Genome Organization and Transcription in Intact Organisms.Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized in multiple scales, from nucleosomes to chromosome territories. Recently, genome-wide methods identified an intermediate level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), that play key roles in transcriptional regulation. However, these methods cannot directly examine the interplay between transcriptional activation and chromosome architecture while maintaining spatial information. Here we present a multiplexed, sequential imaging approach (Hi-M) that permits simultaneous detection of chromosome organization and transcription in single nuclei. This allowed us to unveil the changes in 3D chromatin organization occurring upon transcriptional activation and homologous chromosome unpairing during awakening of the zygotic genome in intact Drosophila embryos. Excitingly, the ability of Hi-M to explore the multi-scale chromosome architecture with spatial resolution at different stages of development or during the cell cycle will be key to understanding the mechanisms and consequences of the 4D organization of the genome."	0
"32049006"	"A Switch in Tissue Stem Cell Identity Causes Neuroendocrine Tumors in Drosophila Gut.Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are able to generate gut-specific enterocytes, as well as neural-like enteroendocrine cells. It is unclear how the tissue identity of the ISC lineage is regulated to confer cell-lineage fidelity. Here, we show that, in adult Drosophila midgut, loss of the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack in ISCs causes a self-renewal program switch to neural stem cell (NSC)-like, and that switch drives neuroendocrine tumor development. In Tramtrack-depleted ISCs, the ectopically expressed Deadpan acts as a major self-renewal factor for cell propagation, and Sequoia acts as a differentiation factor for the neuroendocrine phenotype. In addition, the expression of Sequoia renders NSC-specific self-renewal genes responsive to Notch in ISCs, thus inverting the differentiation-promoting function of Notch into a self-renewal role as in normal NSCs. These results suggest an active maintenance mechanism for the gut identity of ISCs, whose disruption may lead to an improper acquisition of NSC-like traits and tumorigenesis."	0
"32187541"	"Changes in Gut Microbiota by Chronic Stress Impair the Efficacy of Fluoxetine.Major depressive disorders (MDDs) constitute a leading cause of disability worldwide and current pharmacological treatments are partially effective. The gut microbiota (GM) has recently emerged as a target of therapeutic interest for MDDs. In this study, we transfer GM from mice that sustained unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to healthy recipient mice. The fecal transfer induces despair-like behavior, decreases neurogenesis in the hippocampus (HpC), and impairs the antidepressant and neurogenic effects of a standard selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (FLX). These effects are paralleled by deficits in 5-HT bioavailability, biosynthesis, and reuptake in the HpC. Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan restores the levels of 5-HT and its precursors in the HpC, improves HpC neurogenesis, and alleviates despair-like symptoms. Our results reveal that stress-induced changes in GM are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders and minimize FLX efficacy via alterations in the serotonergic pathway of Trp metabolism."	0
"32209479"	"Cannabinoids Rescue Cocaine-Induced Seizures by Restoring Brain Glycine Receptor Dysfunction.Cannabinoids are reported to rescue cocaine-induced seizures (CISs), a severe complication in cocaine users. However, the molecular targets for cannabinoid therapy of CISs remain unclear. Here, we report that the systemic administration of cannabinoids alleviates CISs in a CB<sub>1</sub>/CB<sub>2</sub>-receptor-independent manner. In HEK293 cells and cortical neurons, cocaine-induced dysfunction of the glycine receptor (GlyR) is restored by cannabinoids. Such restoration is blocked by GlyRα1<sup>S296A</sup> mutation. Consistently, the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids on CISs are also eliminated in GlyRα1<sup>S296A</sup> mutant mice. Based on molecular dynamic simulation, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between cocaine and the GlyR is weakened by cannabinoid docking. Without altering cocaine distribution across the brain, cannabinoids significantly suppress cocaine-exaggerated neuronal excitability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus by rehabilitating extra-synaptic GlyR function. Microinjection of cannabinoids into the PFC and hippocampus restores cocaine-puzzled neural activity and alleviates CISs. These findings suggest that using GlyR-hypersensitive cannabinoids may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating CISs."	0
"32333838"	"DNA Methylation Regulates Alternative Polyadenylation via CTCF and the Cohesin Complex.Dysregulation of DNA methylation and mRNA alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) are both prevalent in cancer and have been studied as independent processes. We discovered a DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism when we compared genome-wide DNA methylation and polyadenylation site usage between DNA methylation-competent and DNA methylation-deficient cells. Here, we show that removal of DNA methylation enables CTCF binding and recruitment of the cohesin complex, which, in turn, form chromatin loops that promote proximal polyadenylation site usage. In this DNA demethylated context, either deletion of the CTCF binding site or depletion of RAD21 cohesin complex protein can recover distal polyadenylation site usage. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we authenticated the relationship between DNA methylation and mRNA polyadenylation isoform expression in vivo. This DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism demonstrates how aberrant DNA methylation impacts transcriptome diversity and highlights the potential sequelae of global DNA methylation inhibition as a cancer treatment."	0

Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed.

Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system."	0
"32619402"	"Structural Insights into Pseudokinase Domains of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.Despite their apparent lack of catalytic activity, pseudokinases are essential signaling molecules. Here, we describe the structural and dynamic properties of pseudokinase domains from the Wnt-binding receptor tyrosine kinases (PTK7, ROR1, ROR2, and RYK), which play important roles in development. We determined structures of all pseudokinase domains in this family and found that they share a conserved inactive conformation in their activation loop that resembles the autoinhibited insulin receptor kinase (IRK). They also have inaccessible ATP-binding pockets, occluded by aromatic residues that mimic a cofactor-bound state. Structural comparisons revealed significant domain plasticity and alternative interactions that substitute for absent conserved motifs. The pseudokinases also showed dynamic properties that were strikingly similar to those of IRK. Despite the inaccessible ATP site, screening identified ATP-competitive type-II inhibitors for ROR1. Our results set the stage for an emerging therapeutic modality of ""conformational disruptors"" to inhibit or modulate non-catalytic functions of pseudokinases deregulated in disease."	0
"31857346"	"CDK7 regulates organ size and tumor growth by safeguarding the Hippo pathway effector Yki/Yap/Taz in the nucleus.Hippo signaling controls organ size and tumor progression through a conserved pathway leading to nuclear translocation of the transcriptional effector Yki/Yap/Taz. Most of our understanding of Hippo signaling pertains to its cytoplasmic regulation, but how the pathway is controlled in the nucleus remains poorly understood. Here we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which CDK7 promotes Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization in the nucleus to sustain Hippo pathway outputs. We found that a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4<sup>DCAF12</sup> binds and targets Yki/Yap/Taz for ubiquitination and degradation, whereas CDK7 phosphorylates Yki/Yap/Taz at S169/S128/S90 to inhibit CRL4<sup>DCAF12</sup> recruitment, leading to Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization. As a consequence, inactivation of CDK7 reduced organ size and inhibited tumor growth, which could be reversed by restoring Yki/Yap activity. Our study identifies an unanticipated layer of Hippo pathway regulation, defines a novel mechanism by which CDK7 regulates tissue growth, and implies CDK7 as a drug target for Yap/Taz-driven cancer."	1
"32454028"	"Antibody RING-Mediated Destruction of Endogenous Proteins.To understand gene function, the encoding DNA or mRNA transcript can be manipulated and the consequences observed. However, these approaches do not have a direct effect on the protein product of the gene, which is either permanently abrogated or depleted at a rate defined by the half-life of the protein. We therefore developed a single-component system that could induce the rapid degradation of the specific endogenous protein itself. A construct combining the RING domain of ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 with a protein-specific camelid nanobody mediates target destruction by the ubiquitin proteasome system, a process we describe as antibody RING-mediated destruction (ARMeD). The technique is highly specific because we observed no off-target protein destruction. Furthermore, bacterially produced nanobody-RING fusion proteins electroporated into cells induce degradation of target within minutes. With increasing availability of protein-specific nanobodies, this method will allow rapid and specific degradation of a wide range of endogenous proteins."	0
"32719005"	"Structure of a collagen VI α3 chain VWA domain array: adaptability and functional implications of myopathy causing mutations.Collagen VI is a ubiquitous heterotrimeric protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that plays an essential role in the proper maintenance of skeletal muscle. Mutations in collagen VI lead to a spectrum of congenital myopathies, from the mild Bethlem myopathy to the severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Collagen VI contains only a short triple helix and consists primarily of von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains, protein-protein interaction modules found in a range of ECM proteins. Disease-causing mutations occur commonly in the VWA domains, and the second VWA domain of the α3 chain, the N2 domain, harbors several such mutations. Here, we investigate structure-function relationships of the N2 mutations to shed light on their possible myopathy mechanisms. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of N2, combined with monitoring secretion efficiency in cell culture of selected N2 single-domain mutants, finding that mutations located within the central core of the domain severely affect secretion efficiency. In longer α3 chain constructs, spanning N6-N3, small-angle X-ray scattering demonstrates that the tandem VWA array has a modular architecture and samples multiple conformations in solution. Single-particle EM confirmed the presence of multiple conformations. Structural adaptability appears intrinsic to the VWA domain region of collagen VI α3 and has implications for binding interactions and modulating stiffness within the ECM."	0
"32553165"	"Identification of a G-Protein-Independent Activator of GIRK Channels.G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels are essential effectors of inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. GIRK channels have been implicated in diseases with abnormal neuronal excitability, including epilepsy and addiction. GIRK channels are tetramers composed of either the same subunit (e.g., homotetramers) or different subunits (e.g., heterotetramers). Compounds that specifically target subsets of GIRK channels in vivo are lacking. Previous studies have shown that alcohol directly activates GIRK channels through a hydrophobic pocket located in the cytoplasmic domain of the channel. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a GIRK1-selective activator, termed GiGA1, that targets the alcohol pocket. GiGA1 activates GIRK1/GIRK2 both in vitro and in vivo and, in turn, mitigates the effects of a convulsant in an acute epilepsy mouse model. These results shed light on the structure-based development of subunit-specific GIRK modulators that could provide potential treatments for brain disorders."	0
"32527728"	"The functional role of the αM4 transmembrane helix in the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor probed through mutagenesis and coevolutionary analyses.The activity of the muscle-type <i>Torpedo</i> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is highly sensitive to lipids, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The nAChR transmembrane α-helix, M4, is positioned at the perimeter of each subunit in direct contact with lipids and likely plays a central role in lipid sensing. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying nAChR lipid sensing, we used homology modeling, coevolutionary analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to examine the role of the α-subunit M4 (αM4) in the function of the adult muscle nAChR. Ala substitutions for most αM4 residues, including those in clusters of polar residues at both the N and C termini, and deletion of up to 11 C-terminal residues had little impact on the agonist-induced response. Even Ala substitutions for coevolved pairs of residues at the interface between αM4 and the adjacent helices, αM1 and αM3, had little effect, although some impaired nAChR expression. On the other hand, Ala substitutions for Thr422 and Arg429 caused relatively large losses of function, suggesting functional roles for these specific residues. Ala substitutions for aromatic residues at the αM4-αM1/αM3 interface generally led to gains of function, as previously reported for the prokaryotic homolog, the <i>Erwinia chrysanthemi</i> ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). The functional effects of individual Ala substitutions in αM4 were found to be additive, although not in a completely independent manner. Our results provide insight into the structural features of αM4 that are important. They also suggest how lipid-dependent changes in αM4 structure ultimately modify nAChR function."	0

In the context of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, most studies focused on studying splenic virus-specific CD8 T cells. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of exhausted CD8 T cells isolated from six different tissues during established LCMV infection, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Our data reveal that exhausted cells are heterogeneous, adopt organ-specific transcriptomic profiles, and can be divided into five main functional subpopulations: advanced exhaustion, effector-like, intermediate, proliferating, or memory-like. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that these phenotypes are plastic, suggesting that the tissue microenvironment has a major impact in shaping the phenotype and function of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic infection."	0

Our previous studies have revealed a single Arl13b ortholog in the evolutionarily divergent <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. TbArl13 catalyzes two TbArl3 homologs, TbArl3A and TbArl3C, suggesting the presence of a conserved LIFT pathway in these protozoan parasites. Only a single homolog to the cargo carrier protein Unc119 has been identified in <i>T. brucei</i> genome, but its function in lipidated protein transport has not been characterized. In this study, we exploited the proximity-based biotinylation approach to identify binding partners of TbUnc119. We showed that TbUnc119 binds to a flagellar arginine kinase TbAK3 in a myristoylation-dependent manner and is responsible for its targeting to and enrichment in the flagellum. Interestingly, only TbArl3A, but not TbArl3C interacted with TbUnc119 in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting functional specialization of Arl3-GTPases in <i>T. brucei</i> These results establish the function of TbUnc119 as a myristoylated cargo carrier and support the presence of a conserved LIFT pathway in <i>T. brucei.</i>"	0
"32611769"	"Methyltransferase-like 21C (METTL21C) methylates alanine tRNA synthetase at Lys-943 in muscle tissue.Protein-lysine methylation is a common posttranslational modification (PTM) throughout the human proteome that plays important roles in diverse biological processes. In humans, there are >100 known and candidate protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs), many of which are linked to human diseases. Methyltransferase-like protein 21C (METTL21C) is a PKMT implicated in muscle biology that has been reported to methylate valosin-containing protein/p97 (VCP) and heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8). However, a clear <i>in vitro</i> methyltransferase activity for METTL21C remains yet to be demonstrated, and whether it is an active enzyme that directly methylates substrate(s) <i>in vivo</i> is unclear. Here, we used an unbiased biochemistry-based screening assay coupled to MS, which identified alanine tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) as a direct substrate of METTL21C. We found that METTL21C catalyzes methylation of Lys-943 of AARS1 (AARS1-K943me) both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i><i>In vitro</i> METTL21C-mediated AARS1 methylation was independent of ATP or tRNA molecules. Unlike for AARS1, and in conflict with previous reports, we did not detect METTL21C methylation of VCP and HSPA8. AARS1-K943 methylation in HEK293T cells depends upon METTL21C levels. Finally, METTL2C was almost exclusively expressed in muscle tissue, and, accordingly, we detected METTL21C-catalyzed methylation of AARS1 in mouse skeletal muscle tissue. These results reveal that AARS1 is a <i>bona fide in vitro</i> substrate of METTL21C and suggest a role for the METTL21C-AARS1 axis in the regulation of protein synthesis in muscle tissue. Moreover, our study describes a straightforward protocol for elucidating the physiological substrates of poorly characterized or uncharacterized PKMTs."	1
"32533919"	"Stress Can Induce Transcription of Toxin-Antitoxin Systems without Activating Toxin.Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous genetic elements in bacterial genomes, but their functions are controversial. Although they are frequently postulated to regulate cell growth following stress, few null phenotypes for TA systems have been reported. Here, we show that TA transcript levels can increase substantially in response to stress, but toxin is not liberated. We find that the growth of an Escherichia coli strain lacking ten TA systems encoding endoribonuclease toxins is not affected following exposure to six stresses that each trigger TA transcription. Additionally, using RNA sequencing, we find no evidence of mRNA cleavage following stress. Stress-induced transcription arises from antitoxin degradation and relief of transcriptional autoregulation. Importantly, although free antitoxin is readily degraded in vivo, antitoxin bound to toxin is protected from proteolysis, preventing release of active toxin. Thus, transcription is not a reliable marker of TA activity, and TA systems do not strongly promote survival following individual stresses."	0

This sets an unprecedented stage for exploring the mechanisms that link chromosome structure and biological function.

"32937131"	"Extensive SUMO Modification of Repressive Chromatin Factors Distinguishes Pluripotent from Somatic Cells.Post-translational modification by SUMO is a key regulator of cell identity. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SUMO impedes reprogramming to pluripotency, while in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it represses the emergence of totipotent-like cells, suggesting that SUMO targets distinct substrates to preserve somatic and pluripotent states. Using MS-based proteomics, we show that the composition of endogenous SUMOylomes differs dramatically between MEFs and ESCs. In MEFs, SUMO2/3 targets proteins associated with canonical SUMO functions, such as splicing, and transcriptional regulators driving somatic enhancer selection. In contrast, in ESCs, SUMO2/3 primarily modifies highly interconnected repressive chromatin complexes, thereby preventing chromatin opening and transitioning to totipotent-like states. We also characterize several SUMO-modified pluripotency factors and show that SUMOylation of Dppa2 and Dppa4 impedes the conversion to 2-cell-embryo-like states. Altogether, we propose that rewiring the repertoire of SUMO target networks is a major driver of cell fate decision during embryonic development."	0
"30879903"	"MDM2 Integrates Cellular Respiration and Apoptotic Signaling through NDUFS1 and the Mitochondrial Network.Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2."	1

Here, we report that an evolutionarily conserved microprotein, Mozart1 (Mzt1), regulates subcellular targeting and microtubule formation activity of γ-TuRC at different cell cycle stages. Crystal structures of protein complexes demonstrate that Mzt1 promiscuously interacts with the N-terminal domains of multiple γ-tubulin complex protein subunits in γ-TuRC via an intercalative binding mode. Genetic- and microscopy-based analyses show that promiscuous binding of Mzt1 in γ-TuRC controls specific subcellular localization of γ-TuRC to modulate microtubule nucleation and stabilization in fission yeast. Moreover, we find Mzt1-independent targeting of γ-TuRC to be crucial for mitotic spindle assembly, demonstrating the cell-cycle-dependent regulation and function of γ-TuRC. Our findings reveal a microprotein-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying microtubule cytoskeleton formation, whereby Mzt1 binding promiscuity confers localization specificity on the multi-protein complex γ-TuRC."	0
"32814040"	"Targeted Neurostimulation in Mouse Brains with Non-invasive Ultrasound.Recently developed brain stimulation techniques have significantly advanced our ability to manipulate the brain's function. However, stimulating specific neurons in a desired region without significant surgical invasion remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a neuron-specific and region-targeted neural excitation strategy using non-invasive ultrasound through activation of heterologously expressed mechanosensitive ion channels (MscL-G22S). Low-intensity ultrasound is significantly better at inducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and neuron activation in vitro and at evoking electromyogram (EMG) responses in vivo in targeted cells expressing MscL-G22S. Neurons in the cerebral cortex or dorsomedial striatum of mice are made to express MscL-G22S and stimulated ultrasonically. We find significant upregulation of c-Fos in neuron nuclei only in the regions expressing MscL-G22S compared with the non-MscL controls, as well as in various other regions in the same brain. Thus, we detail an effective approach for activating specific regions and cell types in intact mouse brains by sensitizing them to ultrasound using a mechanosensitive ion channel."	0
"32640216"	"The Diabetes Gene JAZF1 Is Essential for the Homeostatic Control of Ribosome Biogenesis and Function in Metabolic Stress.The ability of pancreatic β-cells to respond to increased demands for insulin during metabolic stress critically depends on proper ribosome homeostasis and function. Excessive and long-lasting stimulation of insulin secretion can elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response, and β-cell apoptosis. Here we show that the diabetes susceptibility gene JAZF1 is a key transcriptional regulator of ribosome biogenesis, global protein, and insulin translation. JAZF1 is excluded from the nucleus, and its expression levels are reduced upon metabolic stress and in diabetes. Genetic deletion of Jazf1 results in global impairment of protein synthesis that is mediated by defects in ribosomal protein synthesis, ribosomal RNA processing, and aminoacyl-synthetase expression, thereby inducing ER stress and increasing β-cell susceptibility to apoptosis. Importantly, JAZF1 function and its pleiotropic actions are impaired in islets of murine T2D and in human islets exposed to metabolic stress. Our study identifies JAZF1 as a central mediator of metabolic stress in β-cells."	0
"31940478"	"Niemann-Pick C1 Heterogeneity of Bat Cells Controls Filovirus Tropism.Fruit bats are suspected to be natural hosts of filoviruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV). Interestingly, however, previous studies suggest that these viruses have different tropisms depending on the bat species. Here, we show a molecular basis underlying the host-range restriction of filoviruses. We find that bat-derived cell lines FBKT1 and ZFBK13-76E show preferential susceptibility to EBOV and MARV, respectively, whereas the other bat cell lines tested are similarly infected with both viruses. In FBKT1 and ZFBK13-76E, unique amino acid (aa) sequences are found in the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, one of the cellular receptors interacting with the filovirus glycoprotein (GP). These aa residues, as well as a few aa differences between EBOV and MARV GPs, are crucial for the differential susceptibility to filoviruses. Taken together, our findings indicate that the heterogeneity of bat NPC1 orthologs is an important factor controlling filovirus species-specific host tropism."	0
"32905769"	"Atf-6 Regulates Lifespan through ER-Mitochondrial Calcium Homeostasis.Individually, dysfunction of both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria has been linked to aging, but how communication between these organelles might be targeted to promote longevity is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, inhibition of the conserved unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) mediator, activating transcription factor (atf)-6, increases lifespan by modulating calcium homeostasis and signaling to mitochondria. Atf-6 loss confers longevity via downregulation of the ER calcium buffer, calreticulin. ER calcium release via the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R/itr-1) is required for longevity, while IP<sub>3</sub>R/itr-1 gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan. Highlighting coordination between organelles, the mitochondrial calcium import channel mcu-1 is also required for atf-6 longevity. IP<sub>3</sub>R inhibition leads to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and hyperfusion, which is sufficient to suppress long life in atf-6 mutants. This study reveals the importance of organellar calcium handling as a critical output for the UPR<sup>ER</sup> in determining the quality of aging."	0
"31940495"	"Targeting the Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNA SLNCR1 by Blocking Its Sequence-Specific Binding to the Androgen Receptor.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of numerous physiological processes and diseases, especially cancers. However, development of lncRNA-based therapies is limited because the mechanisms of many lncRNAs are obscure, and interactions with functional partners, including proteins, remain uncharacterized. The lncRNA SLNCR1 binds to and regulates the androgen receptor (AR) to mediate melanoma invasion and proliferation in an androgen-independent manner. Here, we use biochemical analyses coupled with selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) RNA structure probing to show that the N-terminal domain of AR binds a pyrimidine-rich motif in an unstructured region of SLNCR1. This motif is predictive of AR binding, as we identify an AR-binding motif in lncRNA HOXA11-AS-203. Oligonucleotides that bind either the AR N-terminal domain or the AR RNA motif block the SLNCR1-AR interaction and reduce SLNCR1-mediated melanoma invasion. Delivery of oligos that block SLNCR1-AR interaction thus represent a plausible therapeutic strategy."	0

A well-known target of cyclin D-Cdk4,6 is the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which inhibits cell-cycle progression until its inactivation by phosphorylation. However, the role of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D-Cdk4,6 in cell-cycle progression is unclear because Rb can be phosphorylated by other cyclin-Cdks, and cyclin D-Cdk4,6 has other targets involved in cell division. Here, we show that cyclin D-Cdk4,6 docks one side of an alpha-helix in the Rb C terminus, which is not recognized by cyclins E, A, and B. This helix-based docking mechanism is shared by the p107 and p130 Rb-family members across metazoans. Mutation of the Rb C-terminal helix prevents its phosphorylation, promotes G1 arrest, and enhances Rb's tumor suppressive function. Our work conclusively demonstrates that the cyclin D-Rb interaction drives cell division and expands the diversity of known cyclin-based protein docking mechanisms."	0
"32640232"	"Functional Convergence of Autonomic and Sensorimotor Processing in the Lateral Cerebellum.The cerebellum is involved in the control of voluntary and autonomic rhythmic behaviors, yet it is unclear to what extent it coordinates these in concert. We studied Purkinje cell activity during unperturbed and perturbed respiration in lobules simplex, crus 1, and crus 2. During unperturbed (eupneic) respiration, complex spike and simple spike activity encode the phase of ongoing sensorimotor processing. In contrast, when the respiratory cycle is perturbed by whisker stimulation, mice concomitantly protract their whiskers and advance their inspiration in a phase-dependent manner, preceded by increased simple spike activity. This phase advancement of respiration in response to whisker stimulation can be mimicked by optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells and prevented by cell-specific genetic modification of their AMPA receptors, hampering increased simple spike firing. Thus, the impact of Purkinje cell activity on respiratory control is context and phase dependent, highlighting a coordinating role for the cerebellar hemispheres in aligning autonomic and sensorimotor behaviors."	0
"31708417"	"ATR Protects the Genome against R Loops through a MUS81-Triggered Feedback Loop.R loops arising during transcription induce genomic instability, but how cells respond to the R loop-associated genomic stress is still poorly understood. Here, we show that cells harboring high levels of R loops rely on the ATR kinase for survival. In response to aberrant R loop accumulation, the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 pathway is activated by R loop-induced reversed replication forks. In contrast to the activation of ATR by replication inhibitors, R loop-induced ATR activation requires the MUS81 endonuclease. ATR protects the genome from R loops by suppressing transcription-replication collisions, promoting replication fork recovery, and enforcing a G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, ATR prevents excessive cleavage of reversed forks by MUS81, revealing a MUS81-triggered and ATR-mediated feedback loop that fine-tunes MUS81 activity at replication forks. These results suggest that ATR is a key sensor and suppressor of R loop-induced genomic instability, uncovering a signaling circuitry that safeguards the genome against R loops."	1

Biomarkers such as β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils and Tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease are accessible only via invasive cerebrospinal fluid assays, and reactive oxygen species can be fleeting and challenging to monitor <i>in vivo</i> Although remaining a challenge for <i>in vivo</i> detection, the protein-protein interactions underlying these disease-specific biomarkers present opportunities for the engineering of <i>in vitro</i> pathology-sensitive biosensors. These tools can be useful for investigating early stage events in neurodegenerative diseases in both cellular and animal models and may lead to clinically useful reagents. Here, we report a light- and cellular stress-gated protein switch based on cofilin-actin rod formation, occurring in stressed neurons in the Alzheimer's disease brain and following ischemia. By coupling the stress-sensitive cofilin-actin interaction with the light-responsive Cry2-CIB blue-light switch, referred to hereafter as the CofActor, we accomplished both light- and energetic/oxidative stress-gated control of this interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of both cofilin and actin revealed residues critical for sustaining or abrogating the light- and stress-gated response. Of note, the switch response varied depending on whether cellular stress was generated via glycolytic inhibition or by both glycolytic inhibition and azide-induced ATP depletion. We also demonstrate light- and cellular stress-gated switch function in cultured hippocampal neurons. CofActor holds promise for the tracking of early stage events in neurodegeneration and for investigating actin's interactions with other proteins during cellular stress."	0

The perturbation of nuclear actin dynamics in zygotes results in the misregulation of genes related to genome integrity and abnormal development of mouse embryos. We show that nuclear F-actin ensures DNA damage repair, thus preventing the activation of a zygotic checkpoint. Furthermore, optogenetic control of cofilin nuclear localization reveals the dynamically regulated F-actin nucleoskeleton in zygotes, and its timely disassembly is needed for developmental progression. Nuclear F-actin is a hallmark of totipotent zygotic PN, and the temporal regulation of its polymerized state is necessary for normal embryonic development."	0
"32497497"	"Single-Molecule Imaging of Telomerase RNA Reveals a Recruitment-Retention Model for Telomere Elongation.Extension of telomeres is a critical step in the immortalization of cancer cells. This complex reaction requires proper spatiotemporal coordination of telomerase and telomeres and remains poorly understood at the cellular level. To understand how cancer cells execute this process, we combine CRISPR genome editing and MS2 RNA tagging to image single molecules of telomerase RNA (hTR). Real-time dynamics and photoactivation experiments of hTR in Cajal bodies (CBs) reveal that hTERT controls the exit of hTR from CBs. Single-molecule tracking of hTR at telomeres shows that TPP1-mediated recruitment results in short telomere-telomerase scanning interactions, and then base pairing between hTR and telomere ssDNA promotes long interactions required for stable telomerase retention. Interestingly, POT1 OB-fold mutations that result in abnormally long telomeres in cancers act by enhancing this retention step. In summary, single-molecule imaging unveils the life cycle of telomerase RNA and provides a framework to reveal how cancer-associated mutations mechanistically drive defects in telomere homeostasis."	0

We have determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of complete Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA transcription elongation complexes, comprising RNA polymerase; DNA; RNA bearing an N-utilization-site-like anti-termination element; Nus factors A, B, E, and G; inositol mono-phosphatase SuhB; and ribosomal protein S4. Our structures and structure-informed functional analyses show that fast transcription and anti-termination involve suppression of NusA-stabilized pausing, enhancement of NusG-mediated anti-backtracking, sequestration of the NusG C-terminal domain from termination factor ρ, and the ρ blockade. Strikingly, the factors form a composite RNA chaperone around the RNA polymerase RNA-exit tunnel, which supports co-transcriptional RNA folding and annealing of distal RNA regions.

However, although our understanding of glial biology is increasing, the signals that emanate from axons and regulate myelination remain largely unknown. To identify the core components of the myelination process, here we adopted a microarray analysis approach combined with laser-capture microdissection of spinal motoneurons during the myelinogenic phase of development. We identified neuronal genes whose expression was enriched during myelination and further investigated hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 3 (HRP3 or HDGFRP3). HRP3 was strongly expressed in the white matter fiber tracts of the peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nervous systems during myelination and remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The dynamic localization of HPR3 between axons and nuclei during myelination was consistent with its axonal localization during neuritogenesis. To study this phenomenon, we identified two splice variants encoded by the <i>HRP3</i> gene: the canonical isoform HRP3-I and a newly recognized isoform, HRP3-II. HRP3-I remained solely in the nucleus, whereas HRP3-II displayed distinct axonal localization both before and during myelination. Interestingly, HRP3-II remained in the nuclei of unmyelinated neurons and glial cells, suggesting the existence of a molecular machinery that transfers it to and retains it in the axons of neurons fated for myelination. Overexpression of HRP3-II, but not of HRP3-I, increased Schwann cell numbers and myelination in PNS neuron-glia co-cultures. However, HRP3-II overexpression in CNS co-cultures did not alter myelination."	0

To determine whether HMCES responds to the ssDNA abasic site in cells, we exploited the activity of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A). APOBEC3A preferentially deaminates cytosines to uracils in ssDNA, which are then converted to abasic sites by uracil DNA glycosylase. We find that HMCES-deficient cells are hypersensitive to nuclear APOBEC3A localization. HMCES relocalizes to chromatin in response to nuclear APOBEC3A and protects abasic sites from processing into double-strand breaks (DSBs). Abasic sites induced by APOBEC3A slow both leading and lagging strand synthesis, and HMCES prevents further slowing of the replication fork by translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases zeta (Polζ) and kappa (Polκ). Thus, our study provides direct evidence that HMCES responds to ssDNA abasic sites in cells to prevent DNA cleavage and balance the engagement of TLS polymerases."	0

It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation.

Mice treated with β-glucan are significantly protected against pulmonary Mtb infection, which is associated with the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and increased myelopoiesis. The protective signature of β-glucan is mediated via IL-1 signaling, as β-glucan shows no protection in mice lacking a functional IL-1 receptor (IL1R<sup>-/-</sup>).

Here we report high-resolution in vivo maps of RPA and RAD51 in meiosis, mapping their binding locations and lifespans to individual homologous chromosomes using a genetically engineered hybrid mouse. Together with high-resolution microscopy and DMC1 binding maps, we show that DMC1 and RAD51 have distinct spatial localization on ssDNA: DMC1 binds near the break site, and RAD51 binds away from it. We characterize inter-homolog recombination intermediates bound by RPA in vivo, with properties expected for the critical displacement loop (D-loop) intermediates. These data support the hypothesis that DMC1, not RAD51, performs strand exchange in mammalian meiosis. RPA-bound D-loops can be resolved as crossovers or non-crossovers, but crossover-destined D-loops may have longer lifespans. D-loops resemble crossover gene conversions in size, but their extent is similar in both repair pathways."	0

Biochemical experiments revealed that the cap-dependently translating ribosome becomes a better substrate for the HCV IRES than the free ribosome. Therefore, the HCV IRES is likely to efficiently induce the translation initiation of its downstream mRNA with the captured translating ribosome as soon as the ongoing translation terminates."	0

Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wild-type tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes, and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this histone mark. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders."	0
"32579921"	"The Kinase Activity of Drosophila BubR1 Is Required for Insulin Signaling-Dependent Stem Cell Maintenance.As a core component of the mitotic checkpoint complex, BubR1 has a modular organization of molecular functions, with KEN box and other motifs at the N terminus inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and a kinase domain at the C terminus, whose function remains unsettled, especially at organismal levels. We generate knock-in BubR1 mutations in the Drosophila genome to separately disrupt the KEN box and the kinase domain. All of the mutants are homozygously viable and fertile and show no defects in mitotic progression. The mutants without kinase activity have an increased lifespan and phenotypic changes associated with attenuated insulin signaling, including reduced InR on the cell membrane, weakened PI3K and AKT activity, and elevated expression of dFoxO targets. The BubR1 kinase-dead mutants have a reduced cap cell number in female germaria, which can be rescued by expressing a constitutively active InR. We conclude that one major physiological role of BubR1 kinase in Drosophila is to modulate insulin signaling."	0
"30819644"	"Selective Roles of Vertebrate PCF11 in Premature and Full-Length Transcript Termination.The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including mNET-seq, 3' mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and consequent gene downregulation. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination."	0
"31101497"	"Cyclin-Specific Docking Mechanisms Reveal the Complexity of M-CDK Function in the Cell Cycle.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) coordinate hundreds of molecular events during the cell cycle. Multiple cyclins are involved, but the global role of cyclin-specific phosphorylation has remained unsolved. We uncovered a cyclin docking motif, LxF, that mediates binding of replication factor Cdc6 to mitotic cyclin. This interaction leads to phospho-adaptor Cks1-mediated inhibition of M-CDK to facilitate Cdc6 accumulation and sequestration in mitosis. The LxF motif and Cks1 also mediate the mutual inhibition between M-CDK and the tyrosine kinase Swe1. Additionally, the LxF motif is critical for targeting M-CDK to phosphorylate several mitotic regulators; for example, Spo12 is targeted via LxF to release the phosphatase Cdc14. The results complete the full set of G1, S, and M-CDK docking mechanisms and outline the unified role of cyclin specificity and CDK activity thresholds. Cooperation of cyclin and Cks1 docking creates a variety of CDK thresholds and switching orders, including combinations of last in, first out (LIFO) and first in, first out (FIFO) ordering."	0
"32320660"	"The Asymmetric Expression of SAUR Genes Mediated by ARF7/19 Promotes the Gravitropism and Phototropism of Plant Hypocotyls.The asymmetric distribution of auxin leads to the bending growth of hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, but the signaling events downstream of auxin remain unclear. Here, we identify many SAUR genes showing asymmetric expression in soybean hypocotyls during gravistimulation and then study their homologs in Arabidopsis. SAUR19 subfamily genes have asymmetric expression in Arabidopsis hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, induced by the lateral redistribution of auxin. Both the mutation of SAUR19 subfamily genes and the ectopic expression of SAUR19 weaken these tropic responses, indicating the critical role of their asymmetric expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor ARF7 may directly bind the SAUR19 promoter and activate SAUR19 expression asymmetrically in tropic responses. Taken together, our results reveal that a gravity- or light-triggered asymmetric auxin distribution induces the asymmetric expression of SAUR19 subfamily genes by ARF7 and ARF19 in the hypocotyls, which leads to bending growth during gravitropic and phototropic responses."	1
"32553154"	"Combinatorial Developmental Controls on Striatonigral Circuits.Cortical pyramidal cells are generated locally, from pre-programmed progenitors, to form functionally distinct areas. By contrast, striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are generated remotely from a common source, undergo migration to form mosaics of striosomes and matrix, and become incorporated into functionally distinct sectors. Striatal circuits might thus have a unique logic of developmental organization, distinct from those of the neocortex. We explore this possibility in mice by mapping one set of SPNs, those in striosomes, with striatonigral projections to the dopamine-containing substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Same-age SPNs exhibit topographic striatonigral projections, according to their resident sector. However, the different birth dates of resident SPNs within a given sector specify the destination of their axons within the SNpc. These findings highlight a logic intercalating birth date-dependent and birth date-independent factors in determining the trajectories of SPN axons and organizing specialized units of striatonigral circuitry that could influence behavioral expression and vulnerabilities to disease."	0
"32460015"	"Combined TP53 and RB1 Loss Promotes Prostate Cancer Resistance to a Spectrum of Therapeutics and Confers Vulnerability to Replication Stress.Prostate cancers (PCs) with loss of the potent tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 exhibit poor outcomes. TP53 and RB1 also influence cell plasticity and are frequently lost in PCs with neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Therapeutic strategies that address these aggressive variant PCs are urgently needed. Using deep genomic profiling of 410 metastatic biopsies, we determine the relationships between combined TP53 and RB1 loss and PC phenotypes. Notably, 40% of TP53/RB1-deficient tumors are classified as AR-active adenocarcinomas, indicating that NE differentiation is not an obligate consequence of TP53/RB1 inactivation. A gene expression signature reflecting TP53/RB1 loss is associated with diminished responses to AR antagonists and reduced survival. These tumors exhibit high proliferation rates and evidence of elevated DNA repair processes. While tumor cells lacking TP53/RB1 are highly resistant to all single-agent therapeutics tested, the combination of PARP and ATR inhibition is found to produce significant responses, reflecting a clinically exploitable vulnerability resulting from replication stress."	0
"32426212"	"Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections.The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development."	0
"32023451"	"A Positive Feedback Loop of TET3 and TGF-β1 Promotes Liver Fibrosis.Pathological activation of TGF-β signaling is universal in fibrosis. Aberrant TGF-β signaling in conjunction with transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into fibrogenic myofibroblasts plays a central role in liver fibrosis. Here we report that the DNA demethylase TET3 is anomalously upregulated in fibrotic livers in both humans and mice. We demonstrate that in human HSCs, TET3 promotes profibrotic gene expression by upregulation of multiple key TGF-β pathway genes, including TGFB1. TET3 binds to target gene promoters, inducing demethylation, which in turn facilitates chromatin remodeling and transcription. We also reveal a positive feedback loop between TGF-β1 and TET3 in both HSCs and hepatocytes. Furthermore, TET3 knockdown ameliorates liver fibrosis in mice. Our results uncover a TET3/TGF-β1 positive feedback loop as a crucial determinant of liver fibrosis and suggest that inhibiting TET3 may represent a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis and perhaps other fibrotic diseases."	1
"32668200"	"Construction of the Central Protuberance and L1 Stalk during 60S Subunit Biogenesis.Ribosome assembly is driven by numerous assembly factors, including the Rix1 complex and the AAA ATPase Rea1. These two assembly factors catalyze 60S maturation at two distinct states, triggering poorly understood large-scale structural transitions that we analyzed by cryo-electron microscopy. Two nuclear pre-60S intermediates were discovered that represent previously unknown states after Rea1-mediated removal of the Ytm1-Erb1 complex and reveal how the L1 stalk develops from a pre-mature nucleolar to a mature-like nucleoplasmic state. A later pre-60S intermediate shows how the central protuberance arises, assisted by the nearby Rix1-Rea1 machinery, which was solved in its pre-ribosomal context to molecular resolution. This revealed a Rix1<sub>2</sub>-Ipi3<sub>2</sub> tetramer anchored to the pre-60S via Ipi1, strategically positioned to monitor this decisive remodeling. These results are consistent with a general underlying principle that temporarily stabilized immature RNA domains are successively remodeled by assembly factors, thereby ensuring failsafe assembly progression."	0

"32553172"	"Molecular Competition in G1 Controls When Cells Simultaneously Commit to Terminally Differentiate and Exit the Cell Cycle.Terminal differentiation is essential for the development and maintenance of tissues in all multi-cellular organisms and is associated with permanent exit from the cell cycle. Failure to permanently exit the cell cycle can result in cancer and disease. However, the molecular mechanisms and timing that coordinate differentiation commitment and cell cycle exit are not yet understood. Using live, single-cell imaging of cell cycle progression and differentiation commitment during adipogenesis, we show that a rapid switch mechanism engages exclusively in G1 to trigger differentiation commitment simultaneously with permanent exit from the cell cycle. We identify a molecular competition in G1 between when the differentiation switch is triggered and when the proliferative window closes that allows mitogen and differentiation stimuli to control the balance between terminally differentiating cells produced and progenitor cells kept in reserve, a parameter of critical importance for enabling proper development of tissue domains and organs."	0
"32665404"	"Structural features of bovine colostral immunoglobulin that confer proteolytic stability in a simulated intestinal fluid.Bovine colostral antibodies, purified from cow's milk produced immediately after calving, have enhanced resistance to degradation by intestinal proteases relative to antibodies from human or bovine serum, making them of particular interest as orally administered therapeutic agents. However, the basis of this resistance is not well defined. We evaluated the stability of AVX-470, a bovine colostral anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) polyclonal antibody used in early clinical studies for treatment of ulcerative colitis, using conditions that mimic the human small intestine. AVX-470 was degraded ∼3 times more slowly than human IgG antibodies or infliximab (a monoclonal mouse-human chimeric IgG). Bovine IgG1 antibodies, the primary component of AVX-470, were slowly cleaved to F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragments. In contrast, bovine IgG2 and human IgG1 antibodies were cleaved rapidly into Fab and smaller fragments, pointing to specific regions where additional stability might be gained. Infliximab was modified to incorporate the sequences from these regions, including the bovine IgG1 hinge region and a predicted disulfide bonding motif linking the upper hinge region, the CH1 domain, and the light chain. This infliximab-bovine IgG1 chimera (bovinized infliximab) retained the antigen binding and neutralization activity of the WT sequence but was degraded 9-fold more slowly than the unmodified infliximab. This remarkable increase in stability with as few as 18 amino acid substitutions suggests that this bovinization process is a means to enable oral delivery of proven therapeutic antibodies as well as novel antibodies to targets that have been previously inaccessible to therapies delivered by injection."	0
"31732456"	"Epigenetic Regulator CoREST Controls Social Behavior in Ants.Ants acquire distinct morphological and behavioral phenotypes arising from a common genome, underscoring the importance of epigenetic regulation. In Camponotus floridanus, ""Major"" workers defend the colony, but can be epigenetically reprogrammed to forage for food analogously to ""Minor"" workers. Here, we utilize reprogramming to investigate natural behavioral specification. Reprogramming of Majors upregulates Minor-biased genes and downregulates Major-biased genes, engaging molecular pathways fundamental to foraging behavior. We discover the neuronal corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST) is upregulated upon reprogramming and required for the epigenetic switch to foraging. Genome-wide profiling during reprogramming reveals CoREST represses expression of enzymes that degrade juvenile hormone (JH), a hormone elevated upon reprogramming. High CoREST, low JH-degrader expression, and high JH levels are mirrored in natural Minors, revealing parallel mechanisms of natural and reprogrammed foraging. These results unveil chromatin regulation via CoREST as central to programming of ant social behavior, with potential far-reaching implications for behavioral epigenetics."	0
"32209481"	"c-Src Promotes Tumorigenesis and Tumor Progression by Activating PFKFB3.Reprogramming of glucose metabolism is a key event in tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we show that active c-Src stimulates glycolysis by phosphorylating (Tyr194) and activating PFKFB3, a key enzyme that boosts glycolysis by producing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and activating PFK1. Increased glycolysis intermediates replenish non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine pathway for biosynthesis of cancer cells. PFKFB3 knockout (KO) cells and their counterpart reconstituted with PFKFB3-Y194F show comparably impaired abilities for proliferation, migration, and xenograft formation. Furthermore, PFKFB3-Y194F knockin mice show impaired glycolysis and, mating of these mice with APC<sup>min/+</sup> mice attenuates spontaneous colon cancer formation in APC<sup>min/+</sup> mice. In summary, we identify a specific mechanism by which c-Src mediates glucose metabolism to meet cancer cells' requirements for maximal biosynthesis and proliferation. The PFKFB3-Tyr194 phosphorylation level highly correlates with c-Src activity in clinical tumor samples, indicating its potential as an evaluation for tumor prognosis."	1
"32079653"	"Estrogen-related receptors are targetable ROS sensors.Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause oxidative stress and consequently cell injury contributing to a wide range of diseases. Addressing the critical gaps in our understanding of the adaptive molecular events downstream ROS provocation holds promise for the identification of druggable metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we unveil a direct molecular link between the activity of two estrogen-related receptor (ERR) isoforms and the control of glutamine utilization and glutathione antioxidant production. ERRα down-regulation restricts glutamine entry into the TCA cycle, while ERRγ up-regulation promotes glutamine-driven glutathione production. Notably, we identify increased ERRγ expression/activation as a hallmark of oxidative stress triggered by mitochondrial disruption or chemotherapy. Enhanced tumor antioxidant capacity is an underlying feature of human breast cancer (BCa) patients that respond poorly to treatment. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of ERRγ with the selective inverse agonist GSK5182 increases antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel on poor outcome BCa tumor organoids. Our findings thus underscore the ERRs as novel redox sensors and effectors of a ROS defense program and highlight the potential therapeutic advantage of exploiting ERRγ inhibitors for the treatment of BCa and other diseases where oxidative stress plays a central role."	0
"32755582"	"Altered MICOS Morphology and Mitochondrial Ion Homeostasis Contribute to Poly(GR) Toxicity Associated with C9-ALS/FTD.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) manifests pathological changes in motor neurons and various other cell types. Compared to motor neurons, the contribution of the other cell types to the ALS phenotypes is understudied. G4C2 repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS along with frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), with increasing evidence supporting repeat-encoded poly(GR) in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show in Drosophila muscle that poly(GR) enters mitochondria and interacts with components of the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS), altering MICOS dynamics and intra-subunit interactions. This impairs mitochondrial inner membrane structure, ion homeostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and muscle integrity. Similar mitochondrial defects are observed in patient fibroblasts. Genetic manipulation of MICOS components or pharmacological restoration of ion homeostasis with nigericin effectively rescue the mitochondrial pathology and disease phenotypes in both systems. These results implicate MICOS-regulated ion homeostasis in C9-ALS pathogenesis and suggest potential new therapeutic strategies."	0
"32460009"	"Lactobacilli Have a Niche in the Human Nose.Although an increasing number of beneficial microbiome members are characterized for the human gut and vagina, beneficial microbes are underexplored for the human upper respiratory tract (URT). In this study, we demonstrate that taxa from the beneficial Lactobacillus genus complex are more prevalent in the healthy URT than in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Several URT-specific isolates are cultured, characterized, and further explored for their genetic and functional properties related to adaptation to the URT. Catalase genes are found in the identified lactobacilli, which is a unique feature within this mostly facultative anaerobic genus. Moreover, one of our isolated strains, Lactobacillus casei AMBR2, contains fimbriae that enable strong adherence to URT epithelium, inhibit the growth and virulence of several URT pathogens, and successfully colonize nasal epithelium of healthy volunteers. This study thus demonstrates that specific lactobacilli are adapted to the URT and could have a beneficial keystone function in this habitat."	0
"32101756"	"SEEDSTICK Controls Arabidopsis Fruit Size by Regulating Cytokinin Levels and FRUITFULL.Upon fertilization, the ovary increases in size and undergoes a complex developmental process to become a fruit. We show that cytokinins (CKs), which are required to determine ovary size before fertilization, have to be degraded to facilitate fruit growth. The expression of CKX7, which encodes a cytosolic CK-degrading enzyme, is directly positively regulated post-fertilization by the MADS-box transcription factor STK. Similar to stk, two ckx7 mutants possess shorter fruits than wild type. Quantification of CKs reveals that stk and ckx7 mutants have high CK levels, which negatively control cell expansion during fruit development, compromising fruit growth. Overexpression of CKX7 partially complements the stk fruit phenotype, confirming a role for CK degradation in fruit development. Finally, we show that STK is required for the expression of FUL, which is essential for valve elongation. Overall, we provide insights into the link between CKs and molecular pathways that control fruit growth."	0
"32348770"	"Id1 and Id3 Maintain Steady-State Hematopoiesis by Promoting Sinusoidal Endothelial Cell Survival and Regeneration.Investigating mechanisms that regulate endothelial cell (EC) growth and survival is important for understanding EC homeostasis and how ECs maintain stem cell niches. We report here that targeted loss of Id genes in adult ECs results in dilated, leaky sinusoids and a pro-inflammatory state that increases in severity over time. Disruption in sinusoidal integrity leads to increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, differentiation, migration, and exhaustion. Mechanistically, sinusoidal ECs (SECs) show increased apoptosis because of reduced Bcl2-family gene expression following Id gene ablation. Furthermore, Id1<sup>-/-</sup>Id3<sup>-/-</sup> SECs and upstream type H vessels show increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 and impaired ability to proliferate, which is rescued by reducing E2-2 expression. Id1<sup>-/-</sup>Id3<sup>-/-</sup> mice do not survive sublethal irradiation because of impaired vessel regeneration and hematopoietic failure. Thus, Id genes are required for the survival and regeneration of BM SECs during homeostasis and stress to maintain HSC development."	0

Known risk factors include obesity, diet, and type 2 diabetes; however, the low incidence rate and interconnection of these factors confound the isolation of individual effects. Here, we use epidemiological analysis of prospective human cohorts and parallel tracking of pancreatic cancer in mice to dissect the effects of obesity, diet, and diabetes on pancreatic cancer. Through longitudinal monitoring and multi-omics analysis in mice, we found distinct effects of protein, sugar, and fat dietary components, with dietary sugars increasing Mad2l1 expression and tumor proliferation. Using epidemiological approaches in humans, we find that dietary sugars give a MAD2L1 genotype-dependent increased susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. The translation of these results to a clinical setting could aid in the identification of the at-risk population for screening and potentially harness dietary modification as a therapeutic measure."	0
"32579917"	"Local miRNA-Dependent Translational Control of GABA<sub>A</sub>R Synthesis during Inhibitory Long-Term Potentiation.Molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity at brain inhibitory synapses remain poorly characterized. Increased postsynaptic clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) rapidly strengthens inhibition during inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP). However, it is unclear how synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering is maintained to sustain iLTP. Here, we identify a role for miR376c in regulating the translation of mRNAs encoding the synaptic α1 and γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits, GABRA1 and GABRG2, respectively. Following iLTP induction, transcriptional repression of miR376c is induced through a calcineurin-NFAT-HDAC signaling pathway and promotes increased translation and clustering of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. This pathway is essential for the long-term expression of iLTP and is blocked by miR376c overexpression, specifically impairing inhibitory synaptic strength. Finally, we show that local de novo synthesis of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs occurs exclusively in dendrites and in a miR376c-dependent manner following iLTP. Together, this work describes a local post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates inhibitory synaptic plasticity via miRNA control of dendritic protein synthesis."	1
"32675285"	"Intracellular autoactivation of TMPRSS11A, an airway epithelial transmembrane serine protease.Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) are a group of enzymes participating in diverse biological processes. Some members of the TTSP family are implicated in viral infection. TMPRSS11A is a TTSP expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells, which has been shown to cleave and activate spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A that converts the one-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme. By expression in human embryonic kidney 293, esophageal EC9706, and lung epithelial A549 and 16HBE cells, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the activation cleavage of human TMPRSS11A was mediated by autocatalysis. Moreover, we found that TMPRSS11A activation cleavage occurred before the protein reached the cell surface, as indicated by studies with trypsin digestion to remove cell surface proteins, treatment with cell organelle-disturbing agents to block intracellular protein trafficking, and analysis of a soluble form of TMPRSS11A without the transmembrane domain. We also showed that TMPRSS11A was able to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results reveal an intracellular autocleavage mechanism in TMPRSS11A zymogen activation, which differs from the extracellular zymogen activation reported in other TTSPs. These findings provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms in regulating TTSP activation."	0
"32375036"	"Antagonistic Center-Surround Mechanisms for Direction Selectivity in the Retina.An antagonistic center-surround receptive field is a key feature in sensory processing, but how it contributes to specific computations such as direction selectivity is often unknown. Retinal On-starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which mediate direction selectivity in direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), exhibit antagonistic receptive field organization: depolarizing to light increments and decrements in their center and surround, respectively. We find that a repetitive stimulation exhausts SAC center and enhances its surround and use it to study how center-surround responses contribute to direction selectivity. Center, but not surround, activation induces direction-selective responses in SACs. Nevertheless, both SAC center and surround elicited direction-selective responses in DSGCs, but to opposite directions. Physiological and modeling data suggest that the opposing direction selectivity can result from inverted temporal balance between excitation and inhibition in DSGCs, implying that SAC's response timing dictates direction selectivity. Our findings reveal antagonistic center-surround mechanisms for direction selectivity and demonstrate how context-dependent receptive field reorganization enables flexible computations."	0

The results suggest substantial genetic heterogeneity based on ancestry, cohort type (military versus civilian), and sex. Two study-wide significant PTSD associations are identified in European and military European cohorts; ZNF140 is predicted to be upregulated in whole blood, and SNRNP35 is predicted to be downregulated in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. In peripheral leukocytes from 175 marines, the observed PTSD differential gene expression correlates with the predicted differences for these individuals, and deployment stress produces glucocorticoid-regulated expression changes that include downregulation of both ZNF140 and SNRNP35. SNRNP35 knockdown in cells validates its functional role in U12-intron splicing. Finally, exogenous glucocorticoids in mice downregulate prefrontal Snrnp35 expression."	0
