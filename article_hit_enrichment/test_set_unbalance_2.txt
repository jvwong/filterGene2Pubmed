"32049017"	"Targeting Macrophage Histone H3 Modification as a Leishmania Strategy to Dampen the NF-κB/NLRP3-Mediated Inflammatory Response.Aberrant macrophage activation during intracellular infection generates immunopathologies that can cause severe human morbidity. A better understanding of immune subversion strategies and macrophage phenotypic and functional responses is necessary to design host-directed intervention strategies. Here, we uncover a fine-tuned transcriptional response that is induced in primary and lesional macrophages infected by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis and dampens NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Subversion is amastigote-specific and characterized by a decreased expression of activating and increased expression of de-activating components of these pro-inflammatory pathways, thus revealing a regulatory dichotomy that abrogates the anti-microbial response. Changes in transcript abundance correlate with histone H3K9/14 hypoacetylation and H3K4 hypo-trimethylation in infected primary and lesional macrophages at promoters of NF-κB-related, pro-inflammatory genes. Our results reveal a Leishmania immune subversion strategy targeting host cell epigenetic regulation to establish conditions beneficial for parasite survival and open avenues for host-directed, anti-microbial drug discovery."	0
"32518164"	"Cytochrome <i>c</i> nitrite reductase from the bacterium <i>Geobacter lovleyi</i> represents a new NrfA subclass.Cytochrome <i>c</i> nitrite reductase (NrfA) catalyzes the reduction of nitrite to ammonium in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) pathway, a process that competes with denitrification, conserves nitrogen, and minimizes nutrient loss in soils. The environmental bacterium <i>Geobacter lovleyi</i> has recently been recognized as a key driver of DNRA in nature, but its enzymatic pathway is still uncharacterized. To address this limitation, here we overexpressed, purified, and characterized <i>G. lovleyi</i> NrfA. We observed that the enzyme crystallizes as a dimer but remains monomeric in solution. Importantly, its crystal structure at 2.55-Å resolution revealed the presence of an arginine residue in the region otherwise occupied by calcium in canonical NrfA enzymes. The presence of EDTA did not affect the activity of <i>G. lovleyi</i> NrfA, and site-directed mutagenesis of this arginine reduced enzymatic activity to <3% of the WT levels. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four separate emergences of Arg-containing NrfA enzymes. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, Arg-containing NrfA from <i>G. lovleyi</i> represents a new subclass of cytochrome <i>c</i> nitrite reductase. Most genera from the exclusive clades of Arg-containing NrfA proteins are also represented in clades containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes, suggesting convergent evolution."	0

We show here that hepatocyte-specific loss of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) disrupts liver metabolic homeostasis and promotes tumour progression. FBP1 is universally silenced in both human and murine liver tumours. Hepatocyte-specific Fbp1 deletion results in steatosis, concomitant with activation and senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Depleting senescent HSCs by 'senolytic' treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence for FBP1 as a metabolic tumour suppressor in liver cancer and establish a critical crosstalk between hepatocyte metabolism and HSC senescence that promotes tumour growth."	0
"31806350"	"The ER-Localized Transmembrane Protein TMEM39A/SUSR2 Regulates Autophagy by Controlling the Trafficking of the PtdIns(4)P Phosphatase SAC1.TMEM39A, encoding an ER-localized transmembrane protein, is a susceptibility locus for multiple autoimmune diseases. The molecular function of TMEM39A remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrated that TMEM39A, also called SUSR2, modulates autophagy activity by regulating the spatial distribution and levels of PtdIns(4)P. Depletion of SUSR2 elevates late endosomal/lysosomal PtdIns(4)P levels, facilitating recruitment of the HOPS complex to promote assembly of the SNARE complex for autophagosome maturation. SUSR2 knockdown also increases the degradative capability of lysosomes. Mechanistically, SUSR2 interacts with the ER-localized PtdIns(4)P phosphatase SAC1 and also the COPII SEC23/SEC24 subunits to promote the ER-to-Golgi transport of SAC1. Retention of SAC1 on the ER in SUSR2 knockdown cells increases the level of PtdIns(3)P produced by the VPS34 complex, promoting autophagosome formation. Our study reveals that TMEM39A/SUSR2 acts as an adaptor protein for efficient export of SAC1 from the ER and provides insights into the pathogenesis of diseases associated with TMEM39A mutations."	0

Although these functions are acquired during thymic ontogeny, the sequence of events that gives rise to discrete effector subsets remains unclear. Using an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis combined with functional assays, we reveal an unappreciated diversity among thymic iNKT cells, especially among iNKT1 cells. Mathematical modeling and biological methods unravel a developmental map whereby iNKT2 cells constitute a transient branching point toward the generation of iNKT1 and iNKT17 cells, which reconciles the two previously proposed models. In addition, we identify the transcription co-factor Four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) as a critical cell-intrinsic regulator of iNKT1 specification. Thus, these data illustrate the changing transcriptional network that guides iNKT cell effector fate."	0
"32492415"	"Radiation Triggers a Dynamic Sequence of Transient Microglial Alterations in Juvenile Brain.Cranial irradiation (IR), an effective tool to treat malignant brain tumors, triggers a chronic pro-inflammatory microglial response, at least in the adult brain. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, combined with histology, we show that the microglial response in the juvenile mouse hippocampus is rapid but returns toward normal within 1 week. The response is characterized by a series of temporally distinct homeostasis-, sensome-, and inflammation-related molecular signatures. We find that a single microglial cell simultaneously upregulates transcripts associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. Finally, we show that juvenile and adult irradiated microglia are already transcriptionally distinct in the early phase after IR. Our results indicate that microglia are involved in the initial stages but may not be responsible for driving long-term inflammation in the juvenile brain."	0
"31226277"	"Structural Basis of an Asymmetric Condensin ATPase Cycle.The condensin protein complex plays a key role in the structural organization of genomes. How the ATPase activity of its SMC subunits drives large-scale changes in chromosome topology has remained unknown. Here we reconstruct, at near-atomic resolution, the sequence of events that take place during the condensin ATPase cycle. We show that ATP binding induces a conformational switch in the Smc4 head domain that releases its hitherto undescribed interaction with the Ycs4 HEAT-repeat subunit and promotes its engagement with the Smc2 head into an asymmetric heterodimer. SMC head dimerization subsequently enables nucleotide binding at the second active site and disengages the Brn1 kleisin subunit from the Smc2 coiled coil to open the condensin ring. These large-scale transitions in the condensin architecture lay out a mechanistic path for its ability to extrude DNA helices into large loop structures."	0
"31051141"	"Reversible Disruption of Specific Transcription Factor-DNA Interactions Using CRISPR/Cas9.The control of gene expression by transcription factor binding sites frequently determines phenotype. However, it is difficult to determine the function of single transcription factor binding sites within larger transcription networks. Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to disrupt binding to specific sites, a method we term CRISPRd. Since CRISPR guide RNAs are longer than transcription factor binding sites, flanking sequence can be used to target specific sites. Targeting dCas9 to an Oct4 site in the Nanog promoter displaced Oct4 from this site, reduced Nanog expression, and slowed division. In contrast, disrupting the Oct4 binding site adjacent to Pax6 upregulated Pax6 transcription and disrupting Nanog binding its own promoter upregulated its transcription. Thus, we can easily distinguish between activating and repressing binding sites and examine autoregulation. Finally, multiple guide RNA expression allows simultaneous inhibition of multiple binding sites, and conditionally destabilized dCas9 allows rapid reversibility."	0

"32873576"	"UTteR control through miRs: fine-tuning ATXN1 levels to prevent ataxia.Pathomechanistic studies of neurodegenerative diseases have documented the toxic effects of mutant protein expression, misfolding, and aggregation. However, alterations in the expression of the corresponding wild-type (WT) gene, due to either variations in copy number or transcriptional regulation, have also been linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Another striking example of this mutant and WT duality is spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) caused by an ATXN1 polyglutamine protein, although subtle variations in WT AXTN1 levels also lead to ataxia. In this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Nitschke and colleagues (pp. 1147-1160) delve into posttranscriptional events that fine-tune ATXN1 expression and uncover a key role for 5' untranslated region (5' UTR)-miR760 interactions. Thus, this study not only provides significant insights into the complexities of modulating the expression of a dosage-sensitive gene but also highlights the critical importance of identifying noncoding polymorphisms as disease risk factors."	0
"32518166"	"The mitochondrial metal transporters mitoferrin1 and mitoferrin2 are required for liver regeneration and cell proliferation in mice.Mitochondrial iron import is essential for iron-sulfur cluster formation and heme biosynthesis. Two nuclear-encoded vertebrate mitochondrial high-affinity iron importers, mitoferrin1 (Mfrn1) and Mfrn2, have been identified in mammals. In mice, the gene encoding Mfrn1, <i>solute carrier family 25 member 37</i> (<i>Slc25a37</i>), is highly expressed in sites of erythropoiesis, and whole-body <i>Slc25a37</i> deletion leads to lethality. Here, we report that mice with a deletion of <i>Slc25a28</i> (encoding Mfrn2) are born at expected Mendelian ratios, but show decreased male fertility due to reduced sperm numbers and sperm motility. <i>Mfrn2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice placed on a low-iron diet exhibited reduced mitochondrial manganese, cobalt, and zinc levels, but not reduced iron. Hepatocyte-specific loss of <i>Slc25a37</i> (encoding Mfrn1) in <i>Mfrn2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not affect animal viability, but resulted in a 40% reduction in mitochondrial iron and reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Placing animals on a low-iron diet exaggerated the reduction in mitochondrial iron observed in liver-specific <i>Mfrn1/2</i>-knockout animals. <i>Mfrn1</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Mfrn2</i><sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow-derived macrophages or skin fibroblasts <i>in vitro</i> were unable to proliferate, and overexpression of Mfrn1-GFP or Mfrn2-GFP prevented this proliferation defect. Loss of both mitoferrins in hepatocytes dramatically reduced regeneration in the adult mouse liver, further supporting the notion that both mitoferrins transport iron and that their absence limits proliferative capacity of mammalian cells. We conclude that Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 contribute to mitochondrial iron homeostasis and are required for high-affinity iron import during active proliferation of mammalian cells."	0
"32348754"	"Netrin-G1 Regulates Microglial Accumulation along Axons and Supports the Survival of Layer V Neurons in the Postnatal Mouse Brain.Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, accumulate along subcerebral projection axons and support neuronal survival during the early postnatal period. It remains unknown how microglia follow an axon-specific distribution pattern to maintain neural circuits. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of microglial accumulation along subcerebral projection axons that were necessary for microglial accumulation in the internal capsule. Screening of molecules involved in this accumulation of microglia to axons of layer V cortical neurons identified netrin-G1, a member of the netrin family of axon guidance molecules with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. Deletion or knockdown of the netrin-G1 gene Ntng1 reduced microglial accumulation and caused loss of cortical neurons. Netrin-G1 ligand-Ngl1 knockout-mice-derived microglia showed reduced accumulation along the axons compared with wild-type microglia. Thus, microglia accumulate around the subcerebral projection axons via NGL1-netrin-G1 signaling and support neuronal survival. Our observations unveil bidirectional neurotrophic interactions between neurons and microglia."	0
"30704899"	"Pacer Is a Mediator of mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 Signaling in Regulation of Autophagosome Maturation and Lipid Metabolism.mTORC1 and GSK3 play critical roles in early stages of (macro)autophagy, but how they regulate late steps of autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 and GSK3-TIP60 signaling converge to modulate autophagosome maturation through Pacer, an autophagy regulator that was identified in our recent study. Hepatocyte-specific Pacer knockout in mice results in impaired autophagy flux, glycogen and lipid accumulation, and liver fibrosis. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates Pacer at serine157 to disrupt the association of Pacer with Stx17 and the HOPS complex and thus abolishes Pacer-mediated autophagosome maturation. Importantly, dephosphorylation of Pacer under nutrient-deprived conditions promotes TIP60-mediated Pacer acetylation, which facilitates HOPS complex recruitment and is required for autophagosome maturation and lipid droplet clearance. This work not only identifies Pacer as a regulator in hepatic autophagy and liver homeostasis in vivo but also reveals a signal integration mechanism involved in late stages of autophagy and lipid metabolism."	1
"30979586"	"ULK1 and ULK2 Regulate Stress Granule Disassembly Through Phosphorylation and Activation of VCP/p97.Disturbances in autophagy and stress granule dynamics have been implicated as potential mechanisms underlying inclusion body myopathy (IBM) and related disorders. Yet the roles of core autophagy proteins in IBM and stress granule dynamics remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that disrupted expression of the core autophagy proteins ULK1 and ULK2 in mice causes a vacuolar myopathy with ubiquitin and TDP-43-positive inclusions; this myopathy is similar to that caused by VCP/p97 mutations, the most common cause of familial IBM. Mechanistically, we show that ULK1/2 localize to stress granules and phosphorylate VCP, thereby increasing VCP's activity and ability to disassemble stress granules. These data suggest that VCP dysregulation and defective stress granule disassembly contribute to IBM-like disease in Ulk1/2-deficient mice. In addition, stress granule disassembly is accelerated by an ULK1/2 agonist, suggesting ULK1/2 as targets for exploiting the higher-order regulation of stress granules for therapeutic intervention of IBM and related disorders."	1
"32514071"	"AP-1 imprints a reversible transcriptional programme of senescent cells.Senescent cells affect many physiological and pathophysiological processes. While select genetic and epigenetic elements for senescence induction have been identified, the dynamics, epigenetic mechanisms and regulatory networks defining senescence competence, induction and maintenance remain poorly understood, precluding the deliberate therapeutic targeting of senescence for health benefits. Here, we examined the possibility that the epigenetic state of enhancers determines senescent cell fate. We explored this by generating time-resolved transcriptomes and epigenome profiles during oncogenic RAS-induced senescence and validating central findings in different cell biology and disease models of senescence. Through integrative analysis and functional validation, we reveal links between enhancer chromatin, transcription factor recruitment and senescence competence. We demonstrate that activator protein 1 (AP-1) 'pioneers' the senescence enhancer landscape and defines the organizational principles of the transcription factor network that drives the transcriptional programme of senescent cells. Together, our findings enabled us to manipulate the senescence phenotype with potential therapeutic implications."	0
"32348751"	"Pbrm1 Steers Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Osteolineage Differentiation by Integrating PBAF-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling and BMP/TGF-β Signaling.Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling determines mesenchymal-stromal-cell (MSC) osteolineage commitment and tissue identity. However, molecular integration of developmental signaling with MSC-intrinsic chromatin regulation remains incompletely understood. SWI/SNF-(BAF) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler implicated in multi-cellular development. We show that BMPs and long-term osteogenic signals in MSCs selectively induce expression of polybromo BAF (PBAF) components Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7. Loss of Pbrm1/Arid2/Brd7 profoundly impairs osteolineage gene expression and osteogenesis without compromising adipogenesis. Pbrm1 loss attenuates MSC in vivo ossification. Mechanistically, Pbrm1/PBAF deficiency impairs Smad1/5/8 activation through locus-specific epi-genomic remodeling, involving Pbrm1 bromodomains, along with transcriptional downregulation of Bmpr/TgfβrII affecting BMP-early-responsive gene expression. Gain of function of BmprIβ, TgfβrII in PBAF-deficient MSCs partly restores Smad1/5/8 activation and osteogenesis. Pbrm1 loss further affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor activity through non-cell-autonomous regulation of microenvironment and niche-factor expression. Together, these findings reveal a link illustrating epi-genomic feedforward control of BMP/TGF-β signaling to transcriptional and cellular plasticity in the mesenchymal microenvironment and account for stromal-SWI/SNF in hematopoiesis."	1
"32402274"	"Protein Kinase A Catalytic Subunit Is a Molecular Switch that Promotes the Pro-tumoral Function of Macrophages.As current therapies benefit only a minority of cancer patients, additional therapeutic targets are needed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have attracted attention for improving therapeutic responses, yet regulatory strategies remain elusive. Here, we show that the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) acts as a molecular switch, inducing a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. In human and murine breast cancer, overactivated PKA in TAMs creates a detrimental microenvironment for cancer progression by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and macrophage-derived arginase 1 (ARG1) expression. Macrophages with genetic deletion of PKA-C are prone to be pro-inflammatory, suggesting a possible immunotherapeutic target. Delivery of liposomal PKA inhibitor facilitates tumor regression and abrogates pro-tumoral TAM functions in mice. The therapeutic effect of targeting PKA is pronounced when combined with αCTLA-4 antibody, increasing cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)<sup>+</sup>GranzymeB<sup>+</sup> T cells by about 60-fold. Our findings demonstrate critical roles of TAM PKA-C in tumor progression and suggest that targeting PKA-C efficiently augments cancer treatment responses."	0

Sweet taste is the primary means of detecting the carbohydrate content of food. Surprisingly, sweet taste sensitivity is responsive to extrinsic factors like diet, and this occurs by unknown mechanisms. Here, we describe an unbiased proteomic investigation into sweet taste sensitivity in the fruit fly. We identify a dopamine/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/CREB axis acting within sweet taste neurons that controls taste perception but is largely dispensable for acute taste transduction. This pathway modulates sweet taste perception in response to both sensory- and nutrient-restricted diets and converges on PGC1α, a critical regulator of metabolic health and lifespan. By electrophysiology, we found that enhanced sucrose taste sensitivity was the result of heightened sweet taste intensity and that PGC1α was both necessary and sufficient for this effect. Together, we provide the first molecular insight into how diet-induced taste perception is regulated within the sweet taste neuron."	0

"32424275"	"Enhancer reprogramming driven by high-order assemblies of transcription factors promotes phenotypic plasticity and breast cancer endocrine resistance.Acquired therapy resistance is a major problem for anticancer treatment, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using an established breast cancer cellular model, we show that endocrine resistance is associated with enhanced phenotypic plasticity, indicated by a general downregulation of luminal/epithelial differentiation markers and upregulation of basal/mesenchymal invasive markers. Consistently, similar gene expression changes are found in clinical breast tumours and patient-derived xenograft samples that are resistant to endocrine therapies. Mechanistically, the differential interactions between oestrogen receptor α and other oncogenic transcription factors, exemplified by GATA3 and AP1, drive global enhancer gain/loss reprogramming, profoundly altering breast cancer transcriptional programs. Our functional studies in multiple culture and xenograft models reveal a coordinated role of GATA3 and AP1 in re-organizing enhancer landscapes and regulating cancer phenotypes. Collectively, our study suggests that differential high-order assemblies of transcription factors on enhancers trigger genome-wide enhancer reprogramming, resulting in transcriptional transitions that promote tumour phenotypic plasticity and therapy resistance."	0
"32755570"	"The MARCH6-SQLE Axis Controls Endothelial Cholesterol Homeostasis and Angiogenic Sprouting.The endothelial monolayer forms a barrier between the lumen of blood vessels and the underlying tissues. Stable VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions are essential for maintaining this barrier, whereas their remodeling is required for angiogenesis in health and disease. Here, we position the ERAD-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a determinant of angiogenic sprouting and barrier integrity through its ability to promote the degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Accordingly, MARCHF6 ablation in endothelial cells increases SQLE protein and cholesterol load. This leads to altered membrane order, disorganized adherens junctions, decreased endothelial barrier function, and impaired SQLE-dependent sprouting angiogenesis. Akin to MARCHF6 silencing, the overexpression of SQLE impairs angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is also attenuated when SQLE is silenced, indicating that fine-tuning cholesterol biosynthesis is a determinant of healthy endothelial function. In summary, we propose a mechanistic link between regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by the MARCH6-SQLE axis and endothelial integrity and angiogenesis."	1

Following transplantation into mice, SC-β cell function is comparable to human islets, but the magnitude and consistency of response in vitro are less robust than observed in cadaveric islets. Here, we profile metabolism of SC-β cells and islets to quantify their capacity to sense glucose and identify reduced anaplerotic cycling in the mitochondria as the cause of reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in SC-β cells. This activity can be rescued by challenging SC-β cells with intermediate metabolites from the TCA cycle and late but not early glycolysis, downstream of the enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase. Bypassing this metabolic bottleneck results in a robust, bi-phasic insulin release in vitro that is identical in magnitude to functionally mature human islets."	0
"31995749"	"Regulatory T Cells Condition Lymphatic Endothelia for Enhanced Transendothelial Migration.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of cell surface lymphotoxin alpha beta (LTα1β2) to activate the LT beta receptor (LTβR) on the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), modulating LEC adhesion molecules, intercellular junctions, and chemokines. We demonstrate a role for Tregs through this pathway to condition the permissiveness of lymphatic endothelia for transendothelial migration (TEM), thus gating leukocyte traffic. Human Tregs share the same property with murine Tregs. Activation of TLR2 on Tregs during inflammation specifically augments LTα1β2-LTβR signaling, which further enhances the permissiveness of LECs to facilitate TEM. The conditioning of endothelia may promote the resolution of inflammation by directing leukocytes out of tissues to lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, Tregs interact with lymphatic endothelia under homeostasis and inflammation and dictate endothelial permissiveness and gating mechanisms for subsequent leukocyte migration through endothelial barriers."	0
"32294471"	"Transcription Dynamics Regulate Poly(A) Tails and Expression of the RNA Degradation Machinery to Balance mRNA Levels.Gene expression is regulated by the rates of synthesis and degradation of mRNAs, but how these processes are coordinated is poorly understood. Here, we show that reduced transcription dynamics of specific genes leads to enhanced m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, preferential activity of the CCR4-Not complex, shortened poly(A) tails, and reduced stability of the respective mRNAs. These effects are also exerted by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which we found to be transcriptional pause sites. However, when transcription dynamics, and subsequently poly(A) tails, are globally altered, cells buffer mRNA levels by adjusting the expression of mRNA degradation machinery. Stress-provoked global impediment of transcription elongation leads to a dramatic inhibition of the mRNA degradation machinery and massive mRNA stabilization. Accordingly, globally enhanced transcription, such as following B cell activation or glucose stimulation, has the opposite effects. This study uncovers two molecular pathways that maintain balanced gene expression in mammalian cells by linking transcription to mRNA stability."	0

A test bed for examining this question is the tongue dorsum, which harbors a complex and important microbial community. Here, we use multiplexed fluorescence spectral imaging to investigate the organization of the tongue microbiome at micron to hundred-micron scales. We design oligonucleotide probes for taxa both abundant and prevalent, as determined by sequence analysis. Imaging reveals a highly structured spatial organization of microbial consortia, ranging in linear dimension from tens to hundreds of microns. The consortia appear to develop from a core of epithelial cells, with taxa clustering in domains suggestive of clonal expansion. Quantitative proximity analysis provides the basis for a model of tongue dorsum microbiome organization and dynamics.

"31940493"	"FOXD3 Regulates VISTA Expression in Melanoma.Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved patient survival in melanoma, but the innate resistance of many patients necessitates the investigation of alternative immune targets. Many immune checkpoint proteins lack proper characterization, including V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA). VISTA expression on immune cells can suppress T cell activity; however, few studies have investigated its expression and regulation in cancer cells. In this study, we observe that VISTA is expressed in melanoma patient samples and cell lines. Tumor cell-specific expression of VISTA promotes tumor onset in vivo, associated with increased intratumoral T regulatory cells, and enhanced PDL-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating macrophages. VISTA transcript levels are regulated by the stemness factor Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3). BRAF inhibition upregulates FOXD3 and reduces VISTA expression. Overall, this study demonstrates melanoma cell expression of VISTA and its regulation by FOXD3, contributing to the rationale for therapeutic strategies that combine targeted inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade."	1

Bacteriophages counteract bacterial responses by encoding anti-CRISPR inhibitor proteins (Acr). However, the structural basis for their inhibitory actions remains largely unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of the AcrIIA2-SpyCas9-sgRNA (single-guide RNA) complex at 3.3 Å resolution. We show that AcrIIA2 binds SpyCas9 at a position similar to the target DNA binding region. More specifically, AcrIIA2 interacts with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition residues of Cas9, preventing target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) detection. Thus, phage-encoded AcrIIA2 appears to act as a DNA mimic that blocks subsequent dsDNA binding by virtue of its highly acidic residues, disabling bacterial Cas9 by competing with target dsDNA binding with a binding motif distinct from AcrIIA4. Our study provides a more detailed mechanistic understanding of AcrIIA2-mediated inhibition of SpyCas9, the most widely used genome-editing tool, opening new avenues for improved regulatory precision during genome editing."	0
"32554464"	"Extended subsite profiling of the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D reveals a region recognized by inflammatory caspase-11.Pyroptosis is the caspase-dependent inflammatory cell death mechanism that underpins the innate immune response against pathogens and is dysregulated in inflammatory disorders. Pyroptosis occurs via two pathways: the canonical pathway, signaled by caspase-1, and the noncanonical pathway, regulated by mouse caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5. All inflammatory caspases activate the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D, but caspase-1 mostly activates the inflammatory cytokine precursors prointerleukin-18 and prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL18/pro-IL1β). Here, <i>in vitro</i> cleavage assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that caspase-11 prefers cleaving gasdermin D over the pro-ILs. However, we found that caspase-11 recognizes protein substrates through a mechanism that is different from that of most caspases. Results of kinetics analysis with synthetic fluorogenic peptides indicated that P1'-P4', the C-terminal gasdermin D region adjacent to the cleavage site, influences gasdermin D recognition by caspase-11. Furthermore, introducing the gasdermin D P1'-P4' region into pro-IL18 enhanced catalysis by caspase-11 to levels comparable with that of gasdermin D cleavage. Pro-IL1β cleavage was only moderately enhanced by similar substitutions. We conclude that caspase-11 specificity is mediated by the P1'-P4' region in its substrate gasdermin D, and similar experiments confirmed that the substrate specificities of the human orthologs of caspase-11, <i>i.e.</i> caspase-4 and caspase-5, are ruled by the same mechanism. We propose that P1'-P4'-based inhibitors could be exploited to specifically target inflammatory caspases."	0

We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1-3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms."	0
"32006463"	"Extraction of mRNA from Stalled Ribosomes by the Ski Complex.The evolutionarily conserved Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 (Ski) complex containing the 3'→5' RNA helicase Ski2 binds to 80S ribosomes near the mRNA entrance and facilitates 3'→5' exosomal degradation of mRNA during ribosome-associated mRNA surveillance pathways. Here, we assayed Ski's activity using an in vitro reconstituted translation system and report that this complex efficiently extracts mRNA from 80S ribosomes in the 3'→5' direction in a nucleotide-by-nucleotide manner. The process is ATP dependent and can occur on pre- and post-translocation ribosomal complexes. The Ski complex can engage productively with mRNA and extract it from 80S complexes containing as few as 19 (but not 13) 3'-terminal mRNA nucleotides starting from the P site. The mRNA-extracting activity of the Ski complex suggests that its role in mRNA quality control pathways is not limited to acceleration of exosomal degradation and could include clearance of stalled ribosomes from mRNA, poising mRNA for degradation and rendering stalled ribosomes recyclable by Pelota/Hbs1/ABCE1."	0
"32697991"	"Cell Competition, the Kinetics of Thymopoiesis, and Thymus Cellularity Are Regulated by Double-Negative 2 to 3 Early Thymocytes.Cell competition in the thymus is a homeostatic process that drives turnover. If the process is impaired, thymopoiesis can be autonomously maintained for several weeks, but this causes leukemia. We aimed to understand the effect of cell competition on thymopoiesis, identify the cells involved, and determine how the process is regulated. Using thymus transplantation experiments, we found that cell competition occurs within the double-negative 2 (DN2) and 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes and inhibits thymus autonomy. Furthermore, the expansion of DN2b is regulated by a negative feedback loop that is imposed by double-positive thymocytes and determines the kinetics of thymopoiesis. This feedback loop affects the cell cycle duration of DN2b, in a response controlled by interleukin 7 availability. Altogether, we show that thymocytes do not merely follow a pre-determined path if provided with the correct signals. Instead, thymopoiesis dynamically integrates cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous aspects that fine-tune normal thymus function."	0
"32668238"	"Modeling Type 1 Diabetes In Vitro Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.Understanding the root causes of autoimmune diseases is hampered by the inability to access relevant human tissues and identify the time of disease onset. To examine the interaction of immune cells and their cellular targets in type 1 diabetes, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells into pancreatic endocrine cells, including β cells. Here, we describe an in vitro platform that models features of human type 1 diabetes using stress-induced patient-derived endocrine cells and autologous immune cells. We demonstrate a cell-type-specific response by autologous immune cells against induced pluripotent stem cell-derived β cells, along with a reduced effect on α cells. This approach represents a path to developing disease models that use patient-derived cells to predict the outcome of an autoimmune response."	0
"32130899"	"Virus-Mediated Suppression of the Antigen Presentation Molecule MR1.The antigen-presenting molecule MR1 presents microbial metabolites related to vitamin B2 biosynthesis to mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells). Although bacteria and fungi drive the MR1 biosynthesis pathway, viruses have not previously been implicated in MR1 expression or its antigen presentation. We demonstrate that several herpesviruses inhibit MR1 cell surface upregulation, including a potent inhibition by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). This virus profoundly suppresses MR1 cell surface expression and targets the molecule for proteasomal degradation, whereas ligand-induced cell surface expression of MR1 prior to infection enables MR1 to escape HSV-1-dependent targeting. HSV-1 downregulation of MR1 is dependent on de novo viral gene expression, and we identify the Us3 viral gene product as functioning to target MR1. Furthermore, HSV-1 downregulation of MR1 disrupts MAIT T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Accordingly, virus-mediated targeting of MR1 defines an immunomodulatory strategy that functionally disrupts the MR1-MAIT TCR axis."	0
"32049013"	"A FLCN-TFE3 Feedback Loop Prevents Excessive Glycogenesis and Phagocyte Activation by Regulating Lysosome Activity.The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) suppresses nuclear translocation of TFE3, a master transcription factor for lysosomal biogenesis, via regulation of amino-acid-sensing Rag GTPases. However, the importance of this lysosomal regulation in mammalian physiology remains unclear. Following hematopoietic-lineage-specific Flcn deletion in mice, we found expansion of vacuolated phagocytes that accumulate glycogen in their cytoplasm, phenotypes reminiscent of lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). We report that TFE3 acts in a feedback loop to transcriptionally activate FLCN expression, and FLCN loss disrupts this loop, augmenting TFE3 activity. Tfe3 deletion in Flcn knockout mice reduces the number of phagocytes and ameliorates LSD-like phenotypes. We further reveal that TFE3 stimulates glycogenesis by promoting the expression of glycogenesis genes, including Gys1 and Gyg, upon loss of Flcn. Taken together, we propose that the FLCN-TFE3 feedback loop acts as a rheostat to control lysosome activity and prevents excessive glycogenesis and LSD-like phagocyte activation."	1

Here we report the cell fate continuum during somatic cell reprogramming at single-cell resolution. We first develop SOT to analyze cell fate continuum from Oct4/Sox2/Klf4- or OSK-mediated reprogramming and show that cells bifurcate into two categories, reprogramming potential (RP) or non-reprogramming (NR). We further show that Klf4 contributes to Cd34+/Fxyd5+/Psca+ keratinocyte-like NR fate and that IFN-γ impedes the final transition to chimera-competent pluripotency along the RP cells. We analyze more than 150,000 single cells from both OSK and chemical reprograming and identify additional NR/RP bifurcation points. Our work reveals a generic bifurcation model for cell fate decisions during somatic cell reprogramming that may be applicable to other systems and inspire further improvements for reprogramming."	0
"31178353"	"3' Uridylation Confers miRNAs with Non-canonical Target Repertoires.Many microRNAs (miRNAs) exist alongside abundant miRNA isoforms (isomiRs), most of which arise from post-maturation sequence modifications such as 3' uridylation. However, the ways in which these sequence modifications affect miRNA function remain poorly understood. Here, using human miR-27a in cell lines as a model, we discovered that a nonfunctional target site unable to base-pair extensively with the miRNA seed sequence can regain function when an upstream adenosine is able to base-pair with a post-transcriptionally added uridine in the miR-27a tail. This tail-U-mediated repression (TUMR) is abolished in cells lacking the uridylation enzymes TUT4 and TUT7, indicating that uridylation alters miRNA function by modulating target recognition. We identified a set of non-canonical targets in human cells that are specifically regulated by uridylated miR-27a. We provide evidence that TUMR expands the targets of other endogenous miRNAs. Our study reveals a function of uridylated isomiRs in regulating non-canonical miRNA targets."	0
"31968262"	"Memory B Cell Activation, Broad Anti-influenza Antibodies, and Bystander Activation Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics.Antibody memory protects humans from many diseases. Protective antibody memory responses require activation of transcriptional programs, cell proliferation, and production of antigen-specific antibodies, but how these aspects of the response are coordinated is poorly understood. We profile the molecular and cellular features of the antibody response to influenza vaccination by integrating single-cell transcriptomics, longitudinal antibody repertoire sequencing, and antibody binding measurements. Single-cell transcriptional profiling reveals a program of memory B cell activation characterized by CD11c and T-bet expression associated with clonal expansion and differentiation toward effector function. Vaccination elicits an antibody clone, which rapidly acquired broad high-affinity hemagglutinin binding during affinity maturation. Unexpectedly, many antibody clones elicited by vaccination do not bind vaccine, demonstrating non-specific activation of bystander antibodies by influenza vaccination. These results offer insight into how molecular recognition, transcriptional programs, and clonal proliferation are coordinated in the human B cell repertoire during memory recall."	0

Given that macrophages play a major role in inflammation, we studied the contribution of Mfn2 to the activity of these cells. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced Mfn2 expression. The use of the Mfn2 and Mfn1 myeloid-conditional knockout (KO) mouse models reveals that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is required for the adaptation of mitochondrial respiration to stress conditions and for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon pro-inflammatory activation. Mfn2 deficiency specifically impairs the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. In addition, the lack of Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is associated with dysfunctional autophagy, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and antigen processing. Mfn2<sup>floxed;CreLysM</sup> mice fail to be protected from Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or LPS endotoxemia. These results reveal an unexpected contribution of Mfn2 to ROS production and inflammation in macrophages."	0
"32783936"	"Human GBP1 Differentially Targets Salmonella and Toxoplasma to License Recognition of Microbial Ligands and Caspase-Mediated Death.Interferon-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) promote cell-intrinsic defense through host cell death. GBPs target pathogens and pathogen-containing vacuoles and promote membrane disruption for release of microbial molecules that activate inflammasomes. GBP1 mediates pyroptosis or atypical apoptosis of Salmonella Typhimurium (STm)- or Toxoplasma gondii (Tg)- infected human macrophages, respectively. The pathogen-proximal detection-mechanisms of GBP1 remain poorly understood, as humans lack functional immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) that assist murine Gbps. Here, we establish that GBP1 promotes the lysis of Tg-containing vacuoles and parasite plasma membranes, releasing Tg-DNA. In contrast, we show GBP1 targets cytosolic STm and recruits caspase-4 to the bacterial surface for its activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but does not contribute to bacterial vacuole escape. Caspase-1 cleaves and inactivates GBP1, and a cleavage-deficient GBP1<sup>D192E</sup> mutant increases caspase-4-driven pyroptosis due to the absence of feedback inhibition. Our studies elucidate microbe-specific roles of GBP1 in infection detection and its triggering of the assembly of divergent caspase signaling platforms."	0
"32540960"	"Photoaffinity labeling identifies an intersubunit steroid-binding site in heteromeric GABA type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors.Allopregnanolone (3α5α-P), pregnanolone, and their synthetic derivatives are potent positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) with <i>in vivo</i> anesthetic, anxiolytic, and anti-convulsant effects. Mutational analysis, photoaffinity labeling, and structural studies have provided evidence for intersubunit and intrasubunit steroid-binding sites in the GABA<sub>A</sub>R transmembrane domain, but revealed only little definition of their binding properties. Here, we identified steroid-binding sites in purified human α1β3 and α1β3γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs by photoaffinity labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]21-[4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirine-3-yl)benzoxy]allopregnanolone ([<sup>3</sup>H]21-<i>p</i>TFDBzox-AP), a potent GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAM. Protein microsequencing established 3α5α-P inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids near the cytoplasmic end of the β subunit M4 (β3Pro-415, β3Leu-417, and β3Thr-418) and M3 (β3Arg-309) helices located at the base of a pocket in the β<sup>+</sup>-α<sup>-</sup> subunit interface that extends to the level of αGln-242, a steroid sensitivity determinant in the αM1 helix. Competition photolabeling established that this site binds with high affinity a structurally diverse group of 3α-OH steroids that act as anesthetics, anti-epileptics, and anti-depressants. The presence of a 3α-OH was crucial: 3-acetylated, 3-deoxy, and 3-oxo analogs of 3α5α-P, as well as 3β-OH analogs that are GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonists, bound with at least 1000-fold lower affinity than 3α5α-P. Similarly, for GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAMs with the C-20 carbonyl of 3α5α-P or pregnanolone reduced to a hydroxyl, binding affinity is reduced by 1,000-fold, whereas binding is retained after deoxygenation at the C-20 position. These results provide a first insight into the structure-activity relationship at the GABA<sub>A</sub>R β<sup>+</sup>-α<sup>-</sup> subunit interface steroid-binding site and identify several steroid PAMs that act via other sites."	0
"32460031"	"Targeting Lymph Node Niches Enhances Type 1 Immune Responses to Immunization.Generating robust CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses is essential for protective vaccine-induced type 1 immunity. Here, we examine whether immunization formulation associated with enhanced vaccine efficacy promotes antigen targeting and cell recruitment into lymph node (LN) niches associated with optimal type 1 responses. Immunization with antigen and Toll-like receptor agonist emulsified in oil leads to an increased differentiation of IFNγ/TNF-α<sup>+</sup> polyfunctional Th1 cells compared to an identical immunization in saline. Oil immunization results in a rapid delivery and persistence of antigen in interfollicular regions (IFRs) of the LN, whereas without oil, antigen is distributed in the medullary region. Following oil immunization, CXCL10-producing inflammatory monocytes accumulate in the IFR, which mobilizes antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into this niche. In this microenvironment, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are advantageously positioned to encounter arriving IL-12-producing inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs). These data suggest that formulations delivering antigen to the LN IFR create an inflammatory niche that can improve vaccine efficacy."	0
"32579929"	"Enhancer RNAs Mediate Estrogen-Induced Decommissioning of Selective Enhancers by Recruiting ERα and Its Cofactor.The function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. By analyzing the genome-wide nascent transcript profiles in breast cancer cells, we identify a special group of eRNAs that are essential for estrogen-induced transcriptional repression. Using eRNAs of TM4SF1 and EFEMP1 as the paradigms, we find that these RNA molecules not only stabilize promoter-enhancer interactions but also recruit liganded estrogen receptor α (ERα) to particular enhancer regions, facilitate the formation of a functional transcriptional complex, and cause gene silencing. Interestingly, ERα is shown to directly bind with eRNAs by its DNA-binding domain. These eRNAs help with the formation of a specific ERα-centered transcriptional complex and promote the association of the histone demethylase KDM2A, which dismisses RNA polymerase II from designated enhancers and suppresses the transcription of target genes. Our work demonstrates a complete mechanism underlying the action of eRNAs in modulating and refining the locus-specific transcriptional program."	0
"32719006"	"Structural and functional studies of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> legumain beta reveal isoform specific mechanisms of activation and substrate recognition.The vacuolar cysteine protease legumain plays important functions in seed maturation and plant programmed cell death. Because of their dual protease and ligase activity, plant legumains have become of particular biotechnological interest, <i>e.g.</i> for the synthesis of cyclic peptides for drug design or for protein engineering. However, the molecular mechanisms behind their dual protease and ligase activities are still poorly understood, limiting their applications. Here, we present the crystal structure of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> legumain isoform β (AtLEGβ) in its zymogen state. Combining structural and biochemical experiments, we show for the first time that plant legumains encode distinct, isoform-specific activation mechanisms. Whereas the autocatalytic activation of isoform γ (AtLEGγ) is controlled by the latency-conferring dimer state, the activation of the monomeric AtLEGβ is concentration independent. Additionally, in AtLEGβ the plant-characteristic two-chain intermediate state is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions, as in AtLEGγ, resulting in significantly different pH stability profiles. The crystal structure of AtLEGβ revealed unrestricted nonprime substrate binding pockets, consistent with the broad substrate specificity, as determined by degradomic assays. Further to its protease activity, we show that AtLEGβ exhibits a true peptide ligase activity. Whereas cleavage-dependent transpeptidase activity has been reported for other plant legumains, AtLEGβ is the first example of a plant legumain capable of linking free termini. The discovery of these isoform-specific differences will allow us to identify and rationally design efficient ligases with application in biotechnology and drug development."	0
"32719007"	"Characterization of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident peroxidases GPx7 and GPx8 shows the higher oxidative activity of GPx7 and its linkage to oxidative protein folding.Oxidative protein folding occurs primarily in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, enabled by a diverse network comprising more than 20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and more than five PDI oxidases. Although the canonical disulfide bond formation pathway involving Ero1α and PDI has been well-studied so far, the physiological roles of the newly identified PDI oxidases, glutathione peroxidase-7 (GPx7) and -8 (GPx8), are only poorly understood. We here demonstrated that human GPx7 has much higher reactivity with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and hence greater PDI oxidation activity than human GPx8. The high reactivity of GPx7 is due to the presence of a catalytic tetrad at the redox-active site, which stabilizes the sulfenylated species generated upon the reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Although it was previously postulated that GPx7 catalysis involved a highly reactive peroxidatic cysteine that can be sulfenylated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we revealed that a resolving cysteine instead regulates the PDI oxidation activity of GPx7. We also determined that GPx7 formed complexes preferentially with PDI and P5 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. Altogether, these results suggest that human GPx7 functions as an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent PDI oxidase in cells, whereas PDI oxidation may not be the central physiological role of human GPx8."	0
"32348759"	"Modulation of Peptidoglycan Synthesis by Recycled Cell Wall Tetrapeptides.The bacterial cell wall is made of peptidoglycan (PG), a polymer that is essential for the maintenance of cell shape and survival. During growth, bacteria remodel their PG, releasing fragments that are predominantly re-internalized and recycled. Here, we show that Vibrio cholerae recycles PG fragments modified with non-canonical d-amino acids (NCDAA), which lead to the accumulation of cytosolic PG tetrapeptides. We demonstrate that the accumulation of recycled tetrapeptides has two regulatory consequences for the cell wall: reduction of d,d-cross-linkage and reduction of PG synthesis. We further demonstrate that l,d-carboxypeptidases from five different species show a preferential activity for substrates containing canonical (d-alanine) versus non-canonical (d-methionine) d-amino acids, suggesting that the accumulation of intracellular tetrapeptides in NCDAA-rich environments is widespread. Collectively, this work reveals a regulatory role of NCDAA linking PG recycling and synthesis to promote optimal cell wall assembly and composition in the stationary phase."	0
"31995746"	"Chronic Viral Infection Promotes Efficient Germinal Center B Cell Responses.Persistent viral infections subvert key elements of adaptive immunity. To compare germinal center (GC) B cell responses in chronic and acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, we exploit activation-induced deaminase (AID) fate-reporter mice and perform adoptive B cell transfer experiments. Chronic infection yields GC B cell responses of higher cellularity than acute infections do, higher memory B cell and antibody secreting cell output for longer periods of time, a better representation of the late B cell repertoire in serum immunoglobulin, and higher titers of protective neutralizing antibodies. GC B cells of chronically infected mice are similarly hypermutated as those emerging from acute infection. They efficiently adapt to viral escape variants and even in hypermutation-impaired AID mutant mice, chronic infection selects for GC B cells with hypermutated B cell receptors (BCRs) and neutralizing antibody formation. These findings demonstrate that, unlike for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, chronic viral infection drives a functional, productive, and protective GC B cell response."	0
"31901448"	"The SUMO Ligase Su(var)2-10 Controls Hetero- and Euchromatic Gene Expression via Establishing H3K9 Trimethylation and Negative Feedback Regulation.Сhromatin is critical for genome compaction and gene expression. On a coarse scale, the genome is divided into euchromatin, which harbors the majority of genes and is enriched in active chromatin marks, and heterochromatin, which is gene-poor but repeat-rich. The conserved molecular hallmark of heterochromatin is the H3K9me3 modification, which is associated with gene silencing. We found that in Drosophila, deposition of most of the H3K9me3 mark depends on SUMO and the SUMO ligase Su(var)2-10, which recruits the histone methyltransferase complex SetDB1/Wde. In addition to repressing repeats, H3K9me3 influences expression of both hetero- and euchromatic host genes. High H3K9me3 levels in heterochromatin are required to suppress spurious transcription and ensure proper gene expression. In euchromatin, a set of conserved genes is repressed by Su(var)2-10/SetDB1-induced H3K9 trimethylation, ensuring tissue-specific gene expression. Several components of heterochromatin are themselves repressed by this pathway, providing a negative feedback mechanism to ensure chromatin homeostasis."	0
"32467227"	"Combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency activates expression of mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1) required for growth of triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer subtype for which effective therapies are unavailable. TNBC has a high frequency of tumor protein p53 (Tp53/p53)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiencies, and combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency is associated with poor prognosis and poor response to anticancer therapies. In this study, we discovered that combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency in TNBC activates expression of the transcription factor mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1). We found that MEOX1 is expressed only in TNBC cells with frequent deficiencies in p53 and PTEN, and that its expression is undetectable in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2+ subtypes, as well as in normal breast cells with wild-type (WT) p53 and PTEN. Notably, siRNA knockdown of both p53 and PTEN activated MEOX1 expression in breast cancer cells, whereas individual knockdowns of either p53 or PTEN had only minimal effects on MEOX1 expression. MEOX1 knockdown abolished cell proliferation of p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC <i>in vitro</i> and inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>, but had no effect on the proliferation of luminal and HER2+ cancer cells and normal breast cells. RNA-Seq and immunoblotting analyses showed that MEOX1 knockdown decreased expression of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B), and STAT6 in p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC cells. These results reveal the effects of combined p53- and PTEN-deficiency on MEOX1 expression and TNBC cell proliferation, suggesting that MEOX1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing p53- and PTEN-deficient TNBC."	0

Here, we discovered a conserved multifunctional GH, SsGalNagA, containing a unique combination of two family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a GH16 domain and a GH20 domain, in the zoonotic pathogen <i>Streptococcus suis</i> 05ZYH33. Enzymatic assays revealed that the SsCBM-GH16 domain displays <i>endo</i>-(β1,4)-galactosidase activity specifically toward the host-derived αGal epitope Gal(α1,3)Gal(β1,4)Glc(NAc)-R, whereas the SsGH20 domain has a wide spectrum of <i>exo</i>-β-<i>N</i>-acetylhexosaminidase activities, including <i>exo</i>-(β1,3)-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminidase activity, and employs this activity to act in tandem with SsCBM-GH16 on the αGal-epitope glycan. Further, we found that the CBM32 domain adjacent to the SsGH16 domain is indispensable for SsGH16 catalytic activity. Surface plasmon resonance experiments uncovered that both CBM32 domains specifically bind to αGal-epitope glycan, and together they had a <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of 3.5 mm toward a pentasaccharide αGal-epitope glycan. Cell-binding and αGal epitope removal assays revealed that SsGalNagA efficiently binds to both swine erythrocytes and tracheal epithelial cells and removes the αGal epitope from these cells, suggesting that SsGalNagA functions in nutrient acquisition or alters host signaling in <i>S. suis</i> Both binding and removal activities were blocked by an αGal-epitope glycan. SsGalNagA is the first enzyme reported to sequentially act on a glycan containing the αGal epitope.

In some humans, <i>hCYP11B2</i> undergoes a unique intron conversion whose function is largely unclear. The intron conversion is formed by a replacement of the segment of DNA within intron 2 of <i>hCYP11B2</i> with the corresponding region of the <i>hCYP11B1</i> gene. We show here that the intron conversion is located in an open chromatin form and binds more strongly to the transcriptional regulators histone acetyltransferase P300 (p300), NFκB, and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). Reporter constructs containing the intron conversion had increased promoter activity on transient transfection in H295R cells compared with WT intron 2. We generated humanized transgenic (TG) mice containing all the introns, exons, and 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of the <i>hCYP11B2</i> gene containing either the intron conversion or WT intron 2. We found that TG mice containing the intron conversion have (<i>a</i>) increased plasma aldosterone levels, (<i>b</i>) increased <i>hCYP11B2</i> mRNA and protein levels, and (<i>c</i>) increased blood pressure compared with TG mice containing WT intron 2. Results of a ChIP assay showed that chromatin obtained from the adrenals of TG mice containing the intron conversion binds more strongly to p300, NFκB, and CEBPα than to WT intron 2.

"32075738"	"The Natural Metabolite 4-Cresol Improves Glucose Homeostasis and Enhances β-Cell Function.Exposure to natural metabolites contributes to the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). Through metabolome profiling, we identify the inverse correlation between serum concentrations of 4-cresol and type 2 diabetes. The chronic administration of non-toxic doses of 4-cresol in complementary preclinical models of CMD reduces adiposity, glucose intolerance, and liver triglycerides, enhances insulin secretion in vivo, stimulates islet density and size, and pancreatic β-cell proliferation, and increases vascularization, suggesting activated islet enlargement. In vivo insulin sensitivity is not affected by 4-cresol. The incubation of mouse isolated islets with 4-cresol results in enhanced insulin secretion, insulin content, and β-cell proliferation of a magnitude similar to that induced by GLP-1. In both CMD models and isolated islets, 4-cresol is associated with the downregulated expression of the kinase DYRK1A, which may mediate its biological effects. Our findings identify 4-cresol as an effective regulator of β-cell function, which opens up perspectives for therapeutic applications in syndromes of insulin deficiency."	0

O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which act in a nutrient- and stress-responsive manner. The precise role of O-GlcNAc in adult stem cells and the relationship between O-GlcNAc and the DNA damage response (DDR) is poorly understood. Here, we show that hyper-O-GlcNacylation leads to elevated insulin signaling, hyperproliferation, and DDR activation that mimic the glucose- and oxidative-stress-induced response. We discover a feedback mechanism involving key downstream effectors of DDR, ATM, ATR, and CHK1/2 that regulates OGT stability to promote O-GlcNAcylation and elevate DDR. This O-GlcNAc-dependent regulatory pathway is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in Drosophila and the DDR in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our findings reveal a conserved mechanistic link among O-GlcNAc cycling, stem cell self-renewal, and DDR with profound implications for stem-cell-derived diseases including cancer."	1

Here, we report that Akita mutant proinsulin forms detergent-insoluble aggregates that entrap wild-type (WT) proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby blocking insulin production. Two distinct quality-control mechanisms operate together to combat this insult: the ER luminal chaperone Grp170 prevents proinsulin aggregation, while the ER membrane morphogenic protein reticulon-3 (RTN3) disposes of aggregates via ER-coupled autophagy (ER-phagy). We show that enhanced RTN-dependent clearance of aggregated Akita proinsulin helps to restore ER export of WT proinsulin, which can promote WT insulin production, potentially alleviating MIDY. We also find that RTN3 participates in the clearance of other mutant prohormone aggregates. Together, these results identify a series of substrates of RTN3-mediated ER-phagy, highlighting RTN3 in the disposal of pathogenic prohormone aggregates."	0

To initiate DSB repair by end joining or homologous recombination, the Mre11-nuclease Rad50-ATPase complex detects and processes diverse and obstructed DNA ends, but a structural mechanism is still lacking. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the E. coli Mre11-Rad50 homolog SbcCD in resting and DNA-bound cutting states. In the resting state, Mre11's nuclease is blocked by ATP-Rad50, and the Rad50 coiled coils appear flexible. Upon DNA binding, the two coiled coils zip up into a rod and, together with the Rad50 nucleotide-binding domains, form a clamp around dsDNA. Mre11 moves to the side of Rad50, binds the DNA end, and assembles a DNA cutting channel for the nuclease reactions. The structures reveal how Mre11-Rad50 can detect and process diverse DNA ends and uncover a clamping and gating function for the coiled coils."	0
"32846128"	"Sequential Organization of Critical Periods in the Mouse Auditory System.Critical periods-time windows of heightened plasticity in postnatal development-are specific to sensory features and are asynchronous. Whether they are timed by a temporally precise developmental program or are sequentially organized is not known. We use electrophysiology and molecular or sensory manipulations to elucidate the biological constraints on critical period timing. Passive sound exposure shows that the cortical representations of two sound features, pure tone and frequency-modulated sweep (FMS), are not influencing each other. Enhancing inhibition before the critical period for pure tone accelerates it without changing the critical period for FMS. Similarly, delaying the critical period for pure tone with white noise exposure has no effect on the critical period for FMS. However, the critical period for FMS starts only if the one for pure tone has occurred. Together, these results indicate that distinct critical periods, although sequentially organized, can be temporally shifted independently of each other."	0
"32433957"	"Distinct Transcriptomic Cell Types and Neural Circuits of the Subiculum and Prosubiculum along the Dorsal-Ventral Axis.Subicular regions play important roles in spatial processing and many cognitive functions, and these are mainly attributed to the subiculum (Sub) rather than the prosubiculum (PS). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify 27 transcriptomic cell types residing in sub-domains of the Sub and PS. Based on in situ expression of reliable transcriptomic markers, the precise boundaries of the Sub and PS are consistently defined along the dorsoventral axis. Using these borders to evaluate Cre-line specificity and tracer injections, we find bona fide Sub projections topographically to structures important for spatial processing and navigation. In contrast, the PS sends its outputs to widespread brain regions crucial for motivation, emotion, reward, stress, anxiety, and fear. The Sub and PS, respectively, dominate dorsal and ventral subicular regions and receive different afferents. These results reveal two molecularly and anatomically distinct circuits centered in the Sub and PS, respectively, providing a consistent explanation for historical data and a clearer foundation for future studies."	0
"32592682"	"An Insulin-Sensitive Circular RNA that Regulates Lifespan in Drosophila.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and accumulate with age in neurons of diverse species. However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo."	0

These efforts require an environment that values the individual student and integrates recent advances from the primary literature in the discipline, experimentally directed research, data collection and analysis, and scientific writing. Current trends shaping these efforts must include critical thinking, experimental testing, computational modeling, and inferential logic. In essence, modern biochemistry and molecular biology education must be informed by, and integrated with, cutting-edge research. This environment relies on sustained research support, commitment to providing the requisite mentoring, access to instrumentation, and state-of-the-art facilities. The academic environment must establish a culture of excellence and faculty engagement, leading to innovation in the classroom and laboratory. These efforts must not lose sight of the importance of multidimensional programs that enrich science literacy in all facets of the population, students and teachers in K-12 schools, nonbiochemistry and molecular biology students, and other stakeholders. As biochemistry and molecular biology educators, we have an obligation to provide students with the skills that allow them to be innovative and self-reliant. The next generation of biochemistry and molecular biology students must be taught proficiencies in scientific and technological literacy, the importance of the scientific discourse, and skills required for problem solvers of the 21st century."	0
"30581142"	"Drp1-Zip1 Interaction Regulates Mitochondrial Quality Surveillance System.Mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control process for eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria, can be induced by a response of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial division. However, the coordination between MMP and mitochondrial division for selecting the damaged portion of the mitochondrial network is less understood. Here, we found that MMP is reduced focally at a fission site by the Drp1 recruitment, which is initiated by the interaction of Drp1 with mitochondrial zinc transporter Zip1 and Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry through the Zip1-MCU complex. After division, healthy mitochondria restore MMP levels and participate in the fusion-fission cycle again, but mitochondria that fail to restore MMP undergo mitophagy. Thus, interfering with the interaction between Drp1 and Zip1 blocks the reduction of MMP and the subsequent mitophagic selection of damaged mitochondria. These results suggest that Drp1-dependent fission provides selective pressure for eliminating ""bad sectors"" in the mitochondrial network, serving as a mitochondrial quality surveillance system."	1

We integrate quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics from over 1,000 post-mortem brains from six cohorts representing Alzheimer's disease (AD), asymptomatic AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and control patients from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease consortium. We define robust co-expression trajectories related to disease progression, including early neuronal, microglial, astrocyte, and immune response modules, and later mRNA splicing and mitochondrial modules. The majority of, but not all, modules are conserved at the transcriptomic level, including module C3, which is only observed in proteome networks and enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Genetic risk enriches in modules changing early in disease and indicates that AD and PSP have distinct causal biological drivers at the pathway level, despite aspects of similar pathology, including synaptic loss and glial inflammatory changes. The conserved, high-confidence proteomic changes enriched in genetic risk represent targets for drug discovery."	0

One of the most studied autophagy-related proteins is LC3. Despite growing evidence that LC3 is enriched in the nucleus, its nuclear role is poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Atg8a protein, homologous to mammalian LC3, interacts with the transcription factor Sequoia in a LIR motif-dependent manner. We show that Sequoia depletion induces autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions through the enhanced expression of autophagy genes. We show that Atg8a interacts with YL-1, a component of a nuclear acetyltransferase complex, and that it is acetylated in nutrient-rich conditions. We also show that Atg8a interacts with the deacetylase Sir2, which deacetylates Atg8a during starvation to activate autophagy. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation of the expression of autophagy genes by Atg8a, which is linked to its acetylation status and its interaction with Sequoia, YL-1, and Sir2."	1

While cell-autonomous consequences of p53 mutation have been studied extensively, the role of p53 in regulating the anti-tumor immune response is still poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of p53 in cancer cells modulates the tumor-immune landscape to circumvent immune destruction. Deletion of p53 promotes the recruitment and instruction of suppressive myeloid CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, in part through increased expression of CXCR3/CCR2-associated chemokines and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and attenuates the CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper 1 (Th1) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in vivo. p53-null tumors also show an accumulation of suppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Finally, we show that two key drivers of tumorigenesis, activation of KRAS and deletion of p53, cooperate to promote immune tolerance."	0
"30738703"	"Porin Associates with Tom22 to Regulate the Mitochondrial Protein Gate Assembly.Mitochondria import nearly all of their resident proteins from the cytosol, and the TOM complex functions as their entry gate. The TOM complex undergoes a dynamic conversion between the majority population of a three-channel gateway (""trimer"") and the minor population that lacks Tom22 and has only two Tom40 channels (""dimer""). Here, we found that the porin Por1 acts as a sink to bind newly imported Tom22. This Por1 association thereby modulates Tom22 integration into the TOM complex, guaranteeing formation of the functional trimeric TOM complex. Por1 sequestration of Tom22 dissociated from the trimeric TOM complex also enhances the dimeric TOM complex, which is preferable for the import of TIM40/MIA-dependent proteins into mitochondria. Furthermore, Por1 appears to contribute to cell-cycle-dependent variation of the functional trimeric TOM complex by chaperoning monomeric Tom22, which arises from the cell-cycle-controlled variation of phosphorylated Tom6."	1

The anaerobic biosynthesis of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), the lower ligand of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, involves five reactions catalyzed by the <i>bza</i> operon gene products, namely the hydroxybenzimidazole synthase BzaAB/BzaF, phosphoribosyltransferase CobT, and three methyltransferases, BzaC, BzaD, and BzaE, that conduct three distinct methylation steps. Of these, the methyltransferases that contribute to benzimidazole lower ligand diversity in cobamides remain to be characterized, and the precise role of the <i>bza</i> operon protein CobT is unclear. In this study, we used the <i>bza</i> operon from the anaerobic bacterium <i>Moorella thermoacetica</i> (comprising <i>bzaA-bzaB-cobT-bzaC</i>) to examine the role of CobT and investigate the activity of the first methyltransferase, BzaC. We studied the phosphoribosylation catalyzed by <i>Mt</i>CobT and found that it regiospecifically activates 5-hydroxybenzimidazole (5-OHBza) to form the 5-OHBza-ribotide (5-OHBza-RP) isomer as the sole product. Next, we characterized the domains of <i>Mt</i>BzaC and reconstituted its methyltransferase activity with the predicted substrate 5-OHBza and with two alternative substrates, the <i>Mt</i>CobT product 5-OHBza-RP and its riboside derivative 5-OHBza-R. Unexpectedly, we found that 5-OHBza-R is the most favored <i>Mt</i>BzaC substrate. Our results collectively explain the long-standing observation that the attachment of the lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis is regiospecific. In conclusion, we validate <i>Mt</i>BzaC as a SAM:hydroxybenzimidazole-riboside methyltransferase (HBIR-OMT). Finally, we propose a new pathway for the synthesis and activation of the benzimidazolyl lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis."	0
"30765193"	"Unravelling Intratumoral Heterogeneity through High-Sensitivity Single-Cell Mutational Analysis and Parallel RNA Sequencing.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for resolving transcriptional heterogeneity. However, its application to studying cancerous tissues is currently hampered by the lack of coverage across key mutation hotspots in the vast majority of cells; this lack of coverage prevents the correlation of genetic and transcriptional readouts from the same single cell. To overcome this, we developed TARGET-seq, a method for the high-sensitivity detection of multiple mutations within single cells from both genomic and coding DNA, in parallel with unbiased whole-transcriptome analysis. Applying TARGET-seq to 4,559 single cells, we demonstrate how this technique uniquely resolves transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) stem and progenitor cells, providing insights into deregulated pathways of mutant and non-mutant cells. TARGET-seq is a powerful tool for resolving the molecular signatures of genetically distinct subclones of cancer cells."	0
"32268082"	"Innate Immunity in the C. elegans Intestine Is Programmed by a Neuronal Regulator of AWC Olfactory Neuron Development.Olfactory neurons allow animals to discriminate nutritious food sources from potential pathogens. From a forward genetic screen, we uncovered a surprising requirement for the olfactory neuron gene olrn-1 in the regulation of intestinal epithelial immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. During nematode development, olrn-1 is required to program the expression of odorant receptors in the AWC olfactory neuron pair. Here, we show that olrn-1 also functions in AWC neurons in the cell non-autonomous suppression of the canonical p38 MAPK PMK-1 immune pathway in the intestine. Low activity of OLRN-1, which activates the p38 MAPK signaling cassette in AWC neurons during larval development, also de-represses the p38 MAPK PMK-1 pathway in the intestine to promote immune effector transcription, increased clearance of an intestinal pathogen, and resistance to bacterial infection. These data reveal an unexpected connection between olfactory receptor development and innate immunity and show that anti-pathogen defenses in the intestine are developmentally programmed."	0
"32726624"	"An Apoptotic Caspase Network Safeguards Cell Death Induction in Pyroptotic Macrophages.Pyroptosis has emerged as a key mechanism by which inflammasomes promote host defense against microbial pathogens and sterile inflammation. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated cell lysis is a hallmark of pyroptosis, but our understanding of cell death signaling during pyroptosis is fragmented. Here, we show that independently of GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization, inflammasome receptors engage caspase-1 and caspase-8, both of which redundantly promote activation of apoptotic executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 in pyroptotic macrophages. Impaired GSDMD pore formation downstream of caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation suffices to unmask the apoptotic phenotype of pyroptotic macrophages. Combined inactivation of initiator caspase-1 and caspase-8, or executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, is required to abolish inflammasome-induced DEVDase activity during pyroptosis and in apoptotic Gsdmd<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Collectively, these results unveil a robust apoptotic caspase network that is activated in parallel to GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization and safeguards cell death induction in pyroptotic macrophages."	1

Here, we find that loss of Vangl2, a core PCP gene, results in opposite effects on pattern completion and pattern separation processes. Mechanistically, we show that Vangl2 loss maintains young postmitotic granule cells in an immature state, providing increased cellular input for pattern separation. The genetic ablation of Vangl2 disrupts granule cell morpho-functional maturation and further prevents CaMKII and GluA1 phosphorylation, disrupting the stabilization of AMPA receptors. As a functional consequence, LTP at lateral perforant path-GC synapses is impaired, leading to defects in pattern completion behavior. In conclusion, we show that Vangl2 exerts a bimodal regulation on young and mature GCs, and its disruption leads to an imbalance in hippocampus-dependent pattern completion and separation processes."	0

The auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factor family regulates auxin-responsive gene expression and exhibits nuclear localization in regions of high auxin responsiveness. Here we show that the ARF7 and ARF19 proteins accumulate in micron-sized assemblies within the cytoplasm of tissues with attenuated auxin responsiveness. We found that the intrinsically disordered middle region and the folded PB1 interaction domain of ARFs drive protein assembly formation. Mutation of a single lysine within the PB1 domain abrogates cytoplasmic assemblies, promotes ARF nuclear localization, and results in an altered transcriptome and morphological defects. Our data suggest a model in which ARF nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning regulates auxin responsiveness, providing a mechanism for cellular competence for auxin signaling."	0
"32234477"	"Brain Endothelial Cells Are Exquisite Sensors of Age-Related Circulatory Cues.Brain endothelial cells (BECs) are key constituents of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protecting the brain from pathogens and restricting access of circulatory factors. Yet, because circulatory proteins have prominent age-related effects on adult neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function in mice, we wondered whether BECs receive and potentially relay signals between the blood and brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal BECs, we discover that capillary BECs-compared with arterial and venous BECs-undergo the greatest transcriptional changes in normal aging, upregulating innate immunity and oxidative stress response pathways. Short-term infusions of aged plasma into young mice recapitulate key aspects of this aging transcriptome, and remarkably, infusions of young plasma into aged mice exert rejuvenation effects on the capillary transcriptome. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional age of BECs is exquisitely sensitive to age-related circulatory cues and pinpoint the BBB itself as a promising therapeutic target to treat brain disease."	0
"32579923"	"Microglia Dysfunction Caused by the Loss of Rhoa Disrupts Neuronal Physiology and Leads to Neurodegeneration.Nervous tissue homeostasis requires the regulation of microglia activity. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the small GTPase Rhoa in adult microglia is sufficient to trigger spontaneous microglia activation, producing a neurological phenotype (including synapse and neuron loss, impairment of long-term potentiation [LTP], formation of β-amyloid plaques, and memory deficits). Mechanistically, loss of Rhoa in microglia triggers Src activation and Src-mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, leading to excitotoxic glutamate secretion. Inhibiting Src in microglia Rhoa-deficient mice attenuates microglia dysregulation and the ensuing neurological phenotype. We also find that the Rhoa/Src signaling pathway is disrupted in microglia of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer disease and that low doses of Aβ oligomers trigger microglia neurotoxic polarization through the disruption of Rhoa-to-Src signaling. Overall, our results indicate that disturbing Rho GTPase signaling in microglia can directly cause neurodegeneration."	1
"31995761"	"The ARK Assay Is a Sensitive and Versatile Method for the Global Detection of DNA-Protein Crosslinks.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are a frequent form of DNA lesion and are strongly inhibitive in diverse DNA transactions. Despite recent developments, the biochemical detection of DPCs remains a limiting factor for the in-depth mechanistic understanding of DPC repair. Here, we develop a sensitive and versatile assay, designated ARK, for the quantitative analysis of DPCs in cells. ARK uses sequential chaotropic and detergent-based isolation of DPCs and substantially enhances sample purity, resulting in a 5-fold increase in detection sensitivity and a 10-fold reduction in background reading. We validate the ARK assay with genetic mutants with established deficiencies in DPC repair and demonstrate its robustness by using common DPC-inducing reagents, including formaldehyde, camptothecin, and etoposide. In addition, we show that the Fanconi anemia pathway contributes to the repair of DPCs. Thus, ARK is expected to facilitate various studies aimed at understanding both fundamental biology and translational applications of DNA-protein crosslink repair."	0

Phosphatidic acid (PA) produced by phospholipase D1 (PLD1) regulates the sequential stages underlying secretory granule exocytosis in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, as revealed by pharmacological approaches and genetic mouse models. Lipidomic analysis shows that secretory granule and plasma membranes display distinct and specific composition in PA. Secretagogue-evoked stimulation triggers the selective production of several PA species at the plasma membrane near the sites of active exocytosis. Rescue experiments in cells depleted of PLD1 activity reveal that mono-unsaturated PA restores the number of exocytotic events, possibly by contributing to granule docking, whereas poly-unsaturated PA regulates fusion pore stability and expansion. Altogether, this work provides insight into the roles that subspecies of the same phospholipid may play based on their fatty acyl chain composition."	0

SORL1-deficient hiPSC neurons show early endosome enlargement, a hallmark cytopathology of AD. There is no effect of SORL1 depletion on endosome size in hiPSC microglia, suggesting a selective effect on neuronal endosomal trafficking. We validate defects in neuronal endosomal traffic by showing altered localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in early endosomes, a site of APP cleavage by the β-secretase (BACE). Inhibition of BACE does not rescue endosome enlargement in SORL1-deficient neurons, suggesting that this phenotype is independent of amyloidogenic APP processing. Our data, together with recent findings, underscore how sporadic AD pathways regulating endosomal trafficking and autosomal-dominant AD pathways regulating APP cleavage independently converge on the defining cytopathology of AD."	0
"30878283"	"Co-translational, Post-translational, and Non-catalytic Roles of N-Terminal Acetyltransferases.Recent studies of N-terminal acetylation have identified new N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and expanded the known functions of these enzymes beyond their roles as ribosome-associated co-translational modifiers. For instance, the identification of Golgi- and chloroplast-associated NATs shows that acetylation of N termini also happens post-translationally. In addition, we now appreciate that some NATs are highly specific; for example, a dedicated NAT responsible for post-translational N-terminal acetylation of actin was recently revealed. Other studies have extended NAT function beyond Nt acetylation, including functions as lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and non-catalytic roles. Finally, emerging studies emphasize the physiological relevance of N-terminal acetylation, including roles in calorie-restriction-induced longevity and pathological α-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Combined, the NATs rise as multifunctional proteins, and N-terminal acetylation is gaining recognition as a major cellular regulator."	0

Here, we engineer the PylT/RS pair encoded by Methanogenic archaeon ISO4-G1 (G1) to be orthogonal to Mma PylT/RS and alter the G1 PylRS active site to accept a complementary ncAA spectrum. We combine the resulting mutual orthogonal pairs for site-specific dual ncAA incorporation of two lysine analogs with high selectivity and efficiency. Demonstrating the robustness of the system, we incorporate two ncAAs with compatible bioorthogonal reactivity into a Notch receptor, as well as a G protein-coupled receptor.

Attenuating MYC expression reverses mitotic defects, even in established tumor cell lines, indicating an ongoing role for MYC in CIN. MYC reprograms mitotic gene expression, and we identify TPX2 to be permissive for spindle assembly in MYC-high cells. TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death, and prevents tumor growth. Further elevating TPX2 expression reduces mitotic defects in MYC-high cells. MYC and TPX2 expression may be useful biomarkers to stratify patients for anti-mitotic therapies.

"32780990"	"An In Vitro Assembly System Identifies Roles for RNA Nucleation and ATP in Yeast Stress Granule Formation.Stress granules (SGs) are condensates of mRNPs that form in response to stress. SGs arise by multivalent protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions. However, the role of RNA-RNA interactions in SG assembly remains understudied. Here, we describe a yeast SG reconstitution system that faithfully recapitulates SG assembly in response to trigger RNAs. SGs assembled by stem-loop RNA triggers are ATP-sensitive, regulated by helicase/chaperone activity, and exhibit the hallmarks of maturation observed for SG proteins that phase-separate in vitro. Additionally, the fraction of total RNA that phase-separates in vitro is sufficient to trigger SG formation. However, condensation of NFT1 mRNA, an enriched transcript in this population, can only assemble an incomplete SG.

Examination of these interactions using purified mitochondria and liposomes with full-length recombinant proteins revealed that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> inhibits apoptosis as a higher-order complex that binds multiple BH3 proteins. Allosteric regulation of this complex by the BH3 sensitizer Bad confers switch-like activity to the indirect activation of Bax.

We show that COQ9 repurposes the bacterial TetR fold to bind aromatic isoprenes with high specificity, including CoQ intermediates that likely reside entirely within the bilayer. We reveal a process by which COQ9 associates with cardiolipin-rich membranes and warps the membrane surface to access this cargo. Finally, we identify a molecular interface between COQ9 and the hydroxylase COQ7, motivating a model whereby COQ9 presents intermediates directly to CoQ enzymes.

"32231310"	"Cystine transporter regulation of pentose phosphate pathway dependency and disulfide stress exposes a targetable metabolic vulnerability in cancer.SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake is critical for maintaining redox balance and cell survival. Here we show that this comes at a significant cost for cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11. Actively importing cystine is potentially toxic due to its low solubility, forcing cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11 (SLC7A11<sup>high</sup>) to constitutively reduce cystine to the more soluble cysteine. This presents a significant drain on the cellular NADPH pool and renders such cells dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway. Limiting glucose supply to SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> cancer cells results in marked accumulation of intracellular cystine, redox system collapse and rapid cell death, which can be rescued by treatments that prevent disulfide accumulation. We further show that inhibitors of glucose transporters selectively kill SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> cancer cells and suppress SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> tumour growth. Our results identify a coupling between SLC7A11-associated cystine metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway, and uncover an accompanying metabolic vulnerability for therapeutic targeting in SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> cancers."	0

Here, we identify an lncRNA, BDNF-AS, whose overexpression is specifically driven by a MEF2A-regulated enhancer in endocrine-resistant and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High levels of BDNF-AS in breast cancer tissues not only feature endocrine resistance in hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients but also correlate with poor outcomes in both HR-positive and TNBC patients. Mechanistically, BDNF-AS acts as a molecular scaffold to promote RNH1 protein degradation via TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of RNH1 at K225. Subsequently, BDNF-AS abolishes RNH1-regulated and RISC-mediated mTOR mRNA decay, therefore sustaining the activation of mTOR signaling. Importantly, mTOR inhibitor, but not PI3K inhibitor, could reverse tamoxifen resistance induced by the overexpression of BDNF-AS. These results point toward a master regulatory role of an enhancer-activated cascade of BDNF-AS/RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR in endocrine resistance and malignant progression of breast cancer."	1

Activation, however, is useful for prediction only if the in-scanner task is related to the predicted phenotype. To further characterize these predictive FC changes, we develop and apply an inter-subject PPI analysis. We find that moderate, but not high, task-induced consistency of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across individuals is useful for prediction. Together, these findings demonstrate that in-scanner tasks have distributed, phenotypically relevant effects on brain functional organization, and they offer a framework to leverage both task activation and FC to reveal the neural bases of complex human traits, symptoms, and behaviors."	0

We report here that human 17-β-estradiol (E2) and its related steroid hormones induce apoptosis by binding directly to phosphodiesterase 3A, which in turn recruits and stabilizes an otherwise fast-turnover protein Schlafen 12 (SLFN12). The elevated SLFN12 binds to ribosomes to exclude the recruitment of signal recognition particles (SRPs), thereby blocking the continuous protein translation occurring on the endoplasmic reticulum of E2-treated cells. These proteins include Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, whose ensuing decrease triggers apoptosis. The SLFN12 protein and an apoptosis activation marker were co-localized in syncytiotrophoblast of human placentas, where levels of estrogen-related hormones are high, and dynamic cell turnover by apoptosis is critical for successful implantation and placenta development."	1
"32234472"	"Targeting the Extrinsic Pathway of Hepatocyte Apoptosis Promotes Clearance of Plasmodium Liver Infection.Plasmodium sporozoites infect the liver and develop into exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate blood-stage disease. The hepatocyte molecular pathways that permit or abrogate parasite replication and merozoite formation have not been thoroughly explored, and a deeper understanding may identify therapeutic strategies to mitigate malaria. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins regulate cell survival and are co-opted by intracellular pathogens to support development. Here, we show that cIAP1 levels are upregulated during Plasmodium liver infection and that genetic or pharmacological targeting of cIAPs using clinical-stage antagonists preferentially kills infected hepatocytes and promotes immunity. Using gene-targeted mice, the mechanism was defined as TNF-TNFR1-mediated apoptosis via caspases 3 and 8 to clear parasites. This study reveals the importance of cIAPs to Plasmodium infection and demonstrates that host-directed antimalarial drugs can eliminate liver parasites and induce immunity while likely providing a high barrier to resistance in the parasite."	0
"32433954"	"Intrauterine Pressures Adjusted by Reichert's Membrane Are Crucial for Early Mouse Morphogenesis.Mammalian embryogenesis proceeds in utero with the support of nutrients and gases from maternal tissues. However, the contribution of the mechanical environment provided by the uterus to embryogenesis remains unaddressed. Notably, how intrauterine pressures are produced, accurately adjusted, and exerted on embryos are completely unknown. Here, we find that Reichert's membrane, a specialized basement membrane that wraps around the implanted mouse embryo, plays a crucial role as a shock absorber to protect embryos from intrauterine pressures. Notably, intrauterine pressures are produced by uterine smooth muscle contractions, showing the highest and most frequent periodic peaks just after implantation. Mechanistically, such pressures are adjusted within the sealed space between the embryo and uterus created by Reichert's membrane and are involved in egg-cylinder morphogenesis as an important biomechanical environment in utero. Thus, we propose the buffer space sealed by Reichert's membrane cushions and disperses intrauterine pressures exerted on embryos for egg-cylinder morphogenesis."	0

Using optogenetics, we activated terminals from ipsi- or contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or primary motor cortex (M1), or thalamus while obtaining simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs or triplets of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and adjacent interneurons. Ipsilateral corticostriatal projections provided stronger excitation to fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) than to MSNs and only sparse and weak excitation to low threshold-spiking interneurons (LTSIs) and cholinergic interneurons (ChINs). Projections from contralateral M1 evoked the strongest responses in LTSIs but none in ChINs, whereas thalamus provided the strongest excitation to ChINs but none to LTSIs. In addition, inputs varied in their glutamate receptor composition and their short-term plasticity. Our data revealed a highly selective organization of excitatory striatal afferents, which is determined by both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal identity."	0

However, conclusive evidence for the conversion of mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells in these organs is lacking. Using embryonal cell lineage tracing with reporters driven by mesenchymal cell marker genes of the female reproductive tract (AMHR2, CSPG4, and PDGFRβ), we show that these reporters are also expressed by some oviductal and uterine epithelial cells at birth. These mesenchymal reporter-positive epithelial cells are maintained in adult mice across multiple pregnancies, respond to ovarian hormones, and form organoids. However, no labeled epithelial cells are present in any oviductal or uterine epithelia when mesenchymal cell labeling was induced in adult mice. Organoids developed from mice labeled in adulthood were also negative for mesenchymal reporters. Collectively, our work found no definitive evidence of MET in the adult fallopian tube and uterine epithelium."	0
"32499400"	"Nutrient-dependent control of RNA polymerase II elongation rate regulates specific gene expression programs by alternative polyadenylation.Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a dynamic process with frequent variations in the elongation rate. However, the physiological relevance of variations in RNAPII elongation kinetics has remained unclear. Here we show in yeast that a RNAPII mutant that reduces the transcription elongation rate causes widespread changes in alternative polyadenylation (APA). We unveil two mechanisms by which APA affects gene expression in the slow mutant: 3' UTR shortening and gene derepression by premature transcription termination of upstream interfering noncoding RNAs. Strikingly, the genes affected by these mechanisms are enriched for functions involved in phosphate uptake and purine synthesis, processes essential for maintenance of the intracellular nucleotide pool. As nucleotide concentration regulates transcription elongation, our findings argue that RNAPII is a sensor of nucleotide availability and that genes important for nucleotide pool maintenance have adopted regulatory mechanisms responsive to reduced rates of transcription elongation."	0

"32049028"	"Opposing Regulation of Cocaine Seeking by Glutamate and GABA Neurons in the Ventral Pallidum.Projections from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum (VP) regulate relapse in animal models of addiction. The VP contains GABAergic (VP<sub>GABA</sub>) and glutamatergic (VP<sub>Glu</sub>) neurons, and a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons co-express enkephalin (VP<sub>Penk</sub>). Rabies tracing reveals that VP<sub>Glu</sub> and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons receive preferential innervation from upstream D1- relative to D2-expressing accumbens neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons inhibits, whereas stimulation of VP<sub>GABA</sub> and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons potentiates cocaine seeking in mice withdrawn from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Calcium imaging reveals cell type-specific activity patterns when animals learn to suppress drug seeking during extinction training versus engaging in cue-induced cocaine seeking. During cued seeking, VP<sub>GABA</sub> neurons increase their overall activity, and VP<sub>Penk</sub> neurons are selectively activated around nose pokes for cocaine. In contrast, VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons increase their spike rate following extinction training. These data show that VP subpopulations differentially encode and regulate cocaine seeking, with VP<sub>Penk</sub> and VP<sub>GABA</sub> neurons facilitating and VP<sub>Glu</sub> neurons inhibiting cocaine seeking."	0
"31561953"	"Life or Death after a Break: What Determines the Choice?DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a constant threat to genomic integrity. Such DSBs need to be repaired to preserve homeostasis at both the cellular and organismal levels. Hence, the DNA damage response (DDR) has evolved to repair these lesions and limit their toxicity. The initiation of DNA repair depends on the activation of the DDR, and we know that the strength of DDR signaling may differentially affect cellular viability. However, we do not fully understand what determines the cytotoxicity of a DSB. Recent work has identified genomic location, (in)correct DNA repair pathway usage, and cell-cycle position as contributors to DSB-induced cytotoxicity. In this review, we discuss how these determinants affect cytotoxicity, highlight recent discoveries, and identify open questions that could help to improve our understanding about cell fate decisions after a DNA DSB."	0

"32169162"	"Mec1 Is Activated at the Onset of Normal S Phase by Low-dNTP Pools Impeding DNA Replication.The Mec1 and Rad53 kinases play a central role during acute replication stress in budding yeast. They are also essential for viability in normal growth conditions, but the signal that activates the Mec1-Rad53 pathway in the absence of exogenous insults is currently unknown. Here, we show that this pathway is active at the onset of normal S phase because deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels present in G<sub>1</sub> phase may not be sufficient to support processive DNA synthesis and impede DNA replication. This activation can be suppressed experimentally by increasing dNTP levels in G<sub>1</sub> phase. Moreover, we show that unchallenged cells entering S phase in the absence of Rad53 undergo irreversible fork collapse and mitotic catastrophe. Together, these data indicate that cells use suboptimal dNTP pools to detect the onset of DNA replication and activate the Mec1-Rad53 pathway, which in turn maintains functional forks and triggers dNTP synthesis, allowing the completion of DNA replication."	0

The two DUBs USP25 and USP28 share high similarity but vary in their cellular functions. USP28 is known for its tumor-promoting role, whereas USP25 is a regulator of the innate immune system and, recently, a role in tumorigenesis was proposed. We solved the structures of the catalytic domains of both proteins and established substantial differences in their activities. While USP28 is a constitutively active dimer, USP25 presents an auto-inhibited tetramer. Our data indicate that the activation of USP25 is not achieved through substrate or ubiquitin binding. USP25 cancer-associated mutations lead to activation in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing a functional link between auto-inhibition and the cancer-promoting role of the enzyme. Our work led to the identification of significant differences between USP25 and USP28 and provided the molecular basis for the development of new and highly specific anti-cancer drugs."	0
"32460029"	"Apical Restriction of the Planar Cell Polarity Component VANGL in Pancreatic Ducts Is Required to Maintain Epithelial Integrity.Cell polarity is essential for the architecture and function of numerous epithelial tissues. Here, we show that apical restriction of planar cell polarity (PCP) components is necessary for the maintenance of epithelial integrity. Using the mammalian pancreas as a model, we find that components of the core PCP pathway, such as the transmembrane protein Van Gogh-like (VANGL), become apically restricted over a period of several days. Expansion of VANGL localization to the basolateral membranes of progenitors leads to their death and disruption of the epithelial integrity. VANGL basolateral expansion does not affect apico-basal polarity but acts in the cells where Vangl is mislocalized by reducing Dishevelled and its downstream target ROCK. This reduction in ROCK activity culminates in progenitor cell egression, death, and eventually pancreatic hypoplasia. Thus, precise spatiotemporal modulation of VANGL-dependent PCP signaling is crucial for proper pancreatic morphogenesis."	0
"32554468"	"Discordance between GLP-1R gene and protein expression in mouse pancreatic islet cells.The insulinotropic actions of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) in β-cells have made it a useful target to manage type 2 diabetes. Metabolic stress reduces β-cell sensitivity to GLP-1, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that <i>Glp1r</i> expression is heterogeneous among β-cells and that metabolic stress decreases the number of GLP-1R-positive β-cells. Here, analyses of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq sequencing (scRNASeq) data from mouse and human β-cells indicated that significant populations of β-cells do not express the <i>Glp1r</i> gene, supporting heterogeneous GLP-1R expression. To check these results, we used complementary approaches employing FACS coupled with quantitative RT-PCR, a validated GLP-1R antibody, and flow cytometry to quantify GLP-1R promoter activity, gene expression, and protein expression in mouse α-, β-, and δ-cells. Experiments with <i>Glp1r</i> reporter mice and a validated GLP-1R antibody indicated that >90% of the β-cells are GLP-1R positive, contradicting the findings with the scRNASeq data. α-cells did not express <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA and δ-cells expressed <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA but not protein. We also examined the expression patterns of GLP-1R in mouse models of metabolic stress. Multiparous female mice had significantly decreased β-cell <i>Glp1r</i> expression, but no reduction in GLP-1R protein levels or GLP-1R-mediated insulin secretion. These findings suggest caution in interpreting the results of scRNASeq for low-abundance transcripts such as the incretin receptors and indicate that GLP-1R is widely expressed in β-cells, absent in α-cells, and expressed at the mRNA, but not protein, level in δ-cells."	0

Using an ex vivo system in which we supply the known survival signals, direct cell contact to stromal cells, and the soluble cytokine a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), we have elucidated the critical signaling pathways required for the survival of long-lived plasma cells. Integrin-mediated contact of bone marrow plasma cells with stromal cells activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, leading to critical inactivation of Forkhead-Box-Protein O1/3 (FoxO1/3) and preventing the activation of mitochondrial stress-associated effector caspases 3 and 7. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K signaling in vivo ablates bone marrow plasma cells. APRIL signaling, by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, blocks activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-associated initiator caspase 12. Thus, stromal-cell-contact-induced PI3K and APRIL-induced NF-κB signaling provide the necessary and complementary signals to maintain bone marrow memory plasma cells."	1

We here report that PGAM1 is overexpressed in gliomas where it increases the efficiency of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by cytoplasmic binding of WIP1 phosphatase, thereby preventing WIP1 nuclear translocation and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing of PGAM1 expression in glioma cells consequently decreases formation of γ-H2AX foci, increases apoptosis, and decreases clonogenicity following irradiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with PGAM1-knockdown cells have significantly improved survival after treatment with IR and TMZ. These effects are counteracted by exogenous expression of two kinase-dead PGAM1 mutants, H186R and Y92F, indicating an important non-enzymatic function of PGAM1. Our findings identify PGAM1 as a potential therapeutic target in gliomas."	1
"32579943"	"The ASC-1 Complex Disassembles Collided Ribosomes.Translating ribosomes that slow excessively incur collisions with trailing ribosomes. Persistent collisions are detected by ZNF598, a ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates sites on the ribosomal 40S subunit to initiate pathways of mRNA and protein quality control. The collided ribosome complex must be disassembled to initiate downstream quality control, but the mechanistic basis of disassembly is unclear. Here, we reconstitute the disassembly of a collided polysome in a mammalian cell-free system. The widely conserved ASC-1 complex (ASCC) containing the ASCC3 helicase disassembles the leading ribosome in an ATP-dependent reaction. Disassembly, but not ribosome association, requires 40S ubiquitination by ZNF598, but not GTP-dependent factors, including the Pelo-Hbs1L ribosome rescue complex. Trailing ribosomes can elongate once the roadblock has been removed and only become targets if they subsequently stall and incur collisions. These findings define the specific role of ASCC during ribosome-associated quality control and identify the molecular target of its activity."	0

Two features of the nascent transcript correlated with RNAPI distribution: folding energy and GC content in the transcription bubble. In vitro experiments confirmed that strong RNA structures close to the polymerase promote forward translocation and limit backtracking, whereas high GC in the transcription bubble slows elongation. A mathematical model for RNAPI elongation confirmed the importance of nascent RNA folding in transcription. RNAPI from S. pombe was similarly sensitive to transcript folding, as were S. cerevisiae RNAPII and RNAPIII.

APOL1 and APOL3 are death-promoting proteins that are partially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. We report that in podocytes, either APOL1 C-terminal helix truncation (APOL1Δ) or APOL3 deletion (APOL3KO) induces similar actomyosin reorganization linked to the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] synthesis by the Golgi PI(4)-kinase IIIB (PI4KB). Both APOL1 and APOL3 can form K<sup>+</sup> channels, but only APOL3 exhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of high affinity to neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), promoting NCS-1-PI4KB interaction and stimulating PI4KB activity. Alteration of the APOL1 C-terminal helix triggers APOL1 unfolding and increased binding to APOL3, affecting APOL3-NCS-1 interaction. Since the podocytes of G1 and G2 patients exhibit an APOL1Δ or APOL3KO-like phenotype, APOL1 C-terminal variants may induce kidney disease by preventing APOL3 from activating PI4KB, with consecutive actomyosin reorganization of podocytes."	0
"32126208"	"Structures of Gα Proteins in Complex with Their Chaperone Reveal Quality Control Mechanisms.Many chaperones promote nascent polypeptide folding followed by substrate release through ATP-dependent conformational changes. Here we show cryoEM structures of Gα subunit folding intermediates in complex with full-length Ric-8A, a unique chaperone-client system in which substrate release is facilitated by guanine nucleotide binding to the client G protein. The structures of Ric-8A-Gα<sub>i</sub> and Ric-8A-Gα<sub>q</sub> complexes reveal that the chaperone employs its extended C-terminal region to cradle the Ras-like domain of Gα, positioning the Ras core in contact with the Ric-8A core while engaging its switch2 nucleotide binding region. The C-terminal α5 helix of Gα is held away from the Ras-like domain through Ric-8A core domain interactions, which critically depend on recognition of the Gα C terminus by the chaperone.

Structure-guided mutagenesis and internalization assay reveal that hZIP4 per se acts as the exclusive zinc sensor, with the transport site's being responsible for zinc sensing. In an effort of seeking sorting signal, a scan of the longest cytosolic loop (L2) leads to identification of a conserved Leu-Gln-Leu motif that is essential for endocytosis. Partial proteolysis of purified hZIP4 demonstrates a structural coupling between the transport site and the L2 upon zinc binding, which supports a working model of how zinc ions at physiological concentration trigger a conformation-dependent endocytosis of the zinc transporter.

The vast majority (>95%) of DPs in these large multigene families still await discovery of their biochemical functions. Here, we elucidated the 3D structures of two pterocarpan-forming proteins with dirigent-like domains. Both proteins stereospecifically convert distinct diastereomeric chiral isoflavonoid precursors to the chiral pterocarpans, (-)- and (+)-medicarpin, respectively. Their 3D structures enabled comparisons with stereoselective lignan- and aromatic terpenoid-forming DP orthologs. Each protein provides entry into diverse plant natural products classes, and our experiments suggest a common biochemical mechanism in binding and stabilizing distinct plant phenol-derived mono- and bis-quinone methide intermediates during different C-C and C-O bond-forming processes. These observations provide key insights into both their appearance and functional diversification of DPs during land plant evolution/adaptation. The proposed biochemical mechanisms based on our findings provide important clues to how additional physiological roles for DPs and proteins harboring dirigent-like domains can now be rationally and systematically identified."	0

However, its phosphorylation level is decreased in individuals with heart failure. The necessity of cMyBP-C phosphorylation for proper contractile function is well-established, but the physiological and pathological consequences of decreased cMyBP-C phosphorylation in the heart are not clear. Herein, using intact adult cardiomyocytes from mouse models expressing phospho-ablated (AAA) and phosphomimetic (DDD) cMyBP-C as well as controls, we found that cMyBP-C dephosphorylation is sufficient to reduce contractile parameters and calcium kinetics associated with prolonged decay time of the calcium transient and increased diastolic calcium levels. Isoproterenol stimulation reversed the depressive contractile and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-kinetic parameters. Moreover, caffeine-induced calcium release yielded no difference between AAA/DDD and controls in calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, sodium-calcium exchanger function and phosphorylation levels of calcium-handling proteins were significantly decreased in AAA hearts compared with controls. Stress conditions caused increases in both spontaneous aftercontractions in AAA cardiomyocytes and the incidence of arrhythmias <i>in vivo</i> compared with the controls. Treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil, a positive cardiac inotropic drug, rescued the contractile deficit in AAA cardiomyocytes, but not the calcium-handling abnormalities. These findings indicate a cascade effect whereby cMyBP-C dephosphorylation causes contractile defects, which then lead to calcium-cycling abnormalities, resulting in aftercontractions and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias under stress conditions. We conclude that improvement of contractile deficits alone without improving calcium handling may be insufficient for effective management of heart failure."	0

Yet, it remains unclear how the diversification in DNA-binding specificity was brought about, and the mutational paths that led to changes in specificity are unknown. Using a pair of evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins, each with a different DNA preference (ParB [Partitioning Protein B] and Noc [Nucleoid Occlusion Factor], which both play roles in bacterial chromosome maintenance), we show that specificity is encoded by a set of four residues at the protein-DNA interface. Combining X-ray crystallography and deep mutational scanning of the interface, we suggest that permissive mutations must be introduced before specificity-switching mutations to reprogram specificity and that mutational paths to new specificity do not necessarily involve dual-specificity intermediates. Overall, our results provide insight into the possible evolutionary history of ParB and Noc and, in a broader context, might be useful for understanding the evolution of other classes of DNA-binding proteins."	0

A combination of noncoding SNPs in the nucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 <i>FLC</i> frequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing cold duration.

However, it remains largely unknown how mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) is established and stably propagated during cell division. In this study, we found that the proteins RYBP and YAF2 each specifically bind H2AK119ub1 to recruit the RYBP-PRC1 or YAF2-PRC1 complex to catalyse the ubiquitination of H2A on neighbouring nucleosomes through a positive-feedback model. Additionally, we demonstrated that histone H1-compacted chromatin enhances the distal propagation of H2AK119ub1, thereby reinforcing the inheritance of H2AK119ub1 during cell division. Moreover, we showed that either disruption of RYBP/YAF2-PRC1 activity or impairment of histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction resulted in a significant defect of the maintenance of H2AK119ub1. Therefore, our results suggest that histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction plays a critical role in the stable propagation of H2AK119ub1 by RYBP/YAF2-PRC1 during cell division."	0
"31940479"	"Neuroinflammation-Associated Aspecific Manipulation of Mouse Predator Fear by Toxoplasma gondii.In rodents, the decrease of felid aversion induced by Toxoplasma gondii, a phenomenon termed fatal attraction, is interpreted as an adaptive manipulation by the neurotropic protozoan parasite. With the aim of understanding how the parasite induces such specific behavioral modifications, we performed a multiparametric analysis of T. gondii-induced changes on host behavior, physiology, and brain transcriptome as well as parasite cyst load and distribution. Using a set of complementary behavioral tests, we provide strong evidence that T. gondii lowers general anxiety in infected mice, increases explorative behaviors, and surprisingly alters predator aversion without selectivity toward felids. Furthermore, we show a positive correlation between the severity of the behavioral alterations and the cyst load, which indirectly reflects the level of inflammation during brain colonization. Taken together, these findings refute the myth of a selective loss of cat fear in T. gondii-infected mice and point toward widespread immune-related alterations of behaviors."	0
"32707033"	"Kinase Interaction Network Expands Functional and Disease Roles of Human Kinases.Protein kinases are essential for signal transduction and control of most cellular processes, including metabolism, membrane transport, motility, and cell cycle. Despite the critical role of kinases in cells and their strong association with diseases, good coverage of their interactions is available for only a fraction of the 535 human kinases. Here, we present a comprehensive mass-spectrometry-based analysis of a human kinase interaction network covering more than 300 kinases. The interaction dataset is a high-quality resource with more than 5,000 previously unreported interactions. We extensively characterized the obtained network and were able to identify previously described, as well as predict new, kinase functional associations, including those of the less well-studied kinases PIM3 and protein O-mannose kinase (POMK). Importantly, the presented interaction map is a valuable resource for assisting biomedical studies. We uncover dozens of kinase-disease associations spanning from genetic disorders to complex diseases, including cancer."	0
"32610130"	"Opposing Ventral Striatal Medium Spiny Neuron Activities Shaped by Striatal Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons during Goal-Directed Behaviors.Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of mice show opposing activities upon the initiation of a food-seeking lever press task. Ventromedial striatal (VMS)-MSNs are inhibited but ventrolateral striatal (VLS)-MSNs are activated; these activities mediate action selection and action initiation, respectively. To understand what input shapes the opposing MSN activities, here, we monitor cortical input activities at the cell population level and artificially reverse them. We demonstrate that the ventral hippocampus (vHP) and the insular cortex (IC) are major inputs to the VMS and VLS, both projections show silencing at the trial start time, and the vHP-VMS and IC-VLS pathways form functionally coupled input-output units during the task. Of note, the upstream IC silencing is converted to the downstream VLS-MSN activation. We find biased localization of striatal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) and verify PV IN-dependent feedforward architecture in the VLS. Our results reveal a distinct mode of cortico-striatal signal conveyance via feedforward disinhibition in behaving animals."	0

We report that the [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] prion allows yeast to anticipate nutrient repletion after periods of starvation, providing a strong selective advantage. By transforming the landscape of post-transcriptional gene expression, [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] regulates the decision between two broad growth and survival strategies: mitotic proliferation or meiotic differentiation into a stress-resistant state. [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] is common in laboratory yeast strains, where standard propagation practice produces regular cycles of nutrient scarcity followed by repletion. Distinct [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] variants are also widespread in wild yeast isolates from multiple niches, establishing that prion polymorphs can be utilized in natural populations. Our data provide a striking example of how protein-based epigenetic switches, hidden in plain sight, can establish a transgenerational memory that integrates adaptive prediction into developmental decisions."	0
"32877670"	"Identification and Structure of a Multidonor Class of Head-Directed Influenza-Neutralizing Antibodies Reveal the Mechanism for Its Recurrent Elicitation.Multidonor antibodies are of interest for vaccine design because they can in principle be elicited in the general population by a common set of immunogens. For influenza, multidonor antibodies have been observed against the hemagglutinin (HA) stem, but not the immunodominant HA head. Here, we identify and characterize a multidonor antibody class (LPAF-a class) targeting the HA head. This class exhibits potent viral entry inhibition against H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (CA09) virus. LPAF-a class antibodies derive from the HV2-70 gene and contain a ""Tyr-Gly-Asp""-motif, which occludes the HA-sialic acid binding site as revealed by a co-crystal structure with HA. Both germline-reverted and mature LPAF antibodies potently neutralize CA09 virus and have nanomolar affinities for CA09 HA. Moreover, increased frequencies for LPFA-a class antibodies are observed in humans after a single vaccination. Overall, this work highlights the identification of a multidonor class of head-directed influenza-neutralizing antibodies and delineates the mechanism of their recurrent elicitation in humans."	0
"32209486"	"Conditional Single Vector CRISPR/SaCas9 Viruses for Efficient Mutagenesis in the Adult Mouse Nervous System.Mice engineered for conditional, cell type-specific gene inactivation have dominated the field of mouse genetics because of the high efficiency of Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technologies have provided alternatives for rapid gene mutagenesis for loss-of-function (LOF) analysis. Whether these strategies can be streamlined for rapid genetic analysis with the efficiencies comparable with those of conventional genetic approaches has yet to be established. We show that a single adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing a recombinase-dependent Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) are as efficient as conventional conditional gene knockout and can be adapted for use in either Cre- or Flp-driver mouse lines. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated for the analysis of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and monoaminergic neurotransmission. Using this strategy, we reveal insight into the role of GABAergic regulation of midbrain GABA-producing neurons in psychomotor activation."	0
"32268098"	"Dynamics of uS19 C-Terminal Tail during the Translation Elongation Cycle in Human Ribosomes.Ribosomes undergo multiple conformational transitions during translation elongation. Here, we report the high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human 80S ribosome in the post-decoding pre-translocation state (classical-PRE) at 3.3-Å resolution along with the rotated (hybrid-PRE) and the post-translocation states (POST). The classical-PRE state ribosome structure reveals a previously unobserved interaction between the C-terminal region of the conserved ribosomal protein uS19 and the A- and P-site tRNAs and the mRNA in the decoding site. In addition to changes in the inter-subunit bridges, analysis of different ribosomal conformations reveals the dynamic nature of this domain and suggests a role in tRNA accommodation and translocation during elongation. Furthermore, we show that disease-associated mutations in uS19 result in increased frameshifting. Together, this structure-function analysis provides mechanistic insights into the role of the uS19 C-terminal tail in the context of mammalian ribosomes."	0

Nme1Cas9 and Nme2Cas9 are compact nucleases for in vivo genome editing. Here, we report structures of meningococcal Cas9 homologs in complex with sgRNA, dsDNA, or the AcrIIC3 anti-CRISPR protein. DNA-bound structures represent an early step of target recognition, a later HNH pre-catalytic state, the HNH catalytic state, and a cleaved-target-DNA-bound state. In the HNH catalytic state of Nme1Cas9, the active site is seen poised at the scissile phosphodiester linkage of the target strand, providing a high-resolution view of the active conformation. The HNH active conformation activates the RuvC domain. Our structures explain how Nme1Cas9 and Nme2Cas9 read distinct PAM sequences and how AcrIIC3 inhibits Nme1Cas9 activity. These structures provide insights into Cas9 domain rearrangements, guide-target engagement, cleavage mechanism, and anti-CRISPR inhibition, facilitating the optimization of these genome-editing platforms."	0

However, the specific functional roles that Caspr2 plays in the central nervous system and their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report on a functional role for Caspr2 in the developing cerebellum. Using a combination of confocal microscopy, biochemical analyses, and behavioral testing, we show that loss of Caspr2 in the <i>Cntnap2</i><sup>-/-</sup> knockout mouse results in impaired Purkinje cell dendritic development, altered intracellular signaling, and motor coordination deficits. We also find that Caspr2 is highly enriched at synaptic specializations in the cerebellum. Using a proteomics approach, we identify type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R1) as a specific synaptic interaction partner of the Caspr2 extracellular domain in the molecular layer of the developing cerebellum. The interaction of the Caspr2 extracellular domain with IP<sub>3</sub>R1 inhibits IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated changes in cellular morphology. Together, our work defines a mechanism by which Caspr2 controls the development and function of the cerebellum and advances our understanding of how Caspr2 dysfunction might lead to specific brain disorders."	1
"32049022"	"Symmetric Arginine Dimethylation Is Selectively Required for mRNA Splicing and the Initiation of Type I and Type III Interferon Signaling.Alternative splicing is well understood to enhance proteome diversity as cells respond to stimuli. However, mechanistic understanding for how the spliceosome processes precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to achieve template diversification is incomplete. We use recently developed enzymatic inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and human naive T lymphocyte activation as a model system to uncover a precise set of mRNA transcripts that require symmetric arginine dimethylation. This methylation-dependent splicing selectivity is associated with a limited set of signaling pathways that are affected when PRMT5 is inhibited. Specifically, we identify a conserved role for symmetric arginine dimethylation in the induction of antiviral type I and type III interferon signaling following T cell receptor and pattern recognition receptor stimulation in human T lymphocytes and undifferentiated human THP-1 monocytes. Altogether, these findings reveal a mechanism by which cells may be enabled to precisely modulate transcript heterogeneity to orchestrate specific functional outcomes."	0

"32610129"	"Angiocrine Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Activation of S1PR2-YAP Signaling Axis in Alveolar Type II Cells Is Essential for Lung Repair.Lung alveolar epithelium is composed of alveolar type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells. AT1 cells mediate gas exchange, whereas AT2 cells act as progenitor cells to repair injured alveoli. Lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) play a crucial but still poorly understood role in regulating alveolar repair. Here, we studied the role of the LMVEC-derived bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in promoting alveolar repair using mice with endothelial-specific deletion of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), the key enzyme promoting S1P generation. These mutant lungs developed airspace-enlargement lesions and exhibited a reduced number of AT1 cells after Pseudomonas-aeruginosa-induced lung injury. We demonstrated that S1P released by LMVECs acted via its receptor, S1PR2, on AT2 cells and induced nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a regulator of AT2 to AT1 transition. Thus, angiocrine S1P released after injury acts via the S1PR2-YAP signaling axis on AT2 cells to promote AT2 to AT1 differentiation required for alveolar repair."	1
"32753671"	"Robust gene expression programs underlie recurrent cell states and phenotype switching in melanoma.Melanoma cells can switch between a melanocytic and a mesenchymal-like state. Scattered evidence indicates that additional intermediate state(s) may exist. Here, to search for such states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied 10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching. Taken together, these analyses indicate that an intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct and stable 'mixed' GRN rather than being a symbiotic heterogeneous mix of cells."	0
"32755585"	"ATF4 Regulates MYB to Increase γ-Globin in Response to Loss of β-Globin.β-Hemoglobinopathies can trigger rapid production of red blood cells in a process known as stress erythropoiesis. Cellular stress prompts differentiating erythroid precursors to express high levels of fetal γ-globin. However, the mechanisms underlying γ-globin production during cellular stress are still poorly defined. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas genome editing to model the stress caused by reduced levels of adult β-globin. We find that decreased β-globin is sufficient to induce robust re-expression of γ-globin, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of differentiating isogenic erythroid precursors implicates ATF4 as a causal regulator of this response. ATF4 binds within the HBS1L-MYB intergenic enhancer and regulates expression of MYB, a known γ-globin regulator. Overall, the reduction of ATF4 upon β-globin knockout decreases the levels of MYB and BCL11A. Identification of ATF4 as a key regulator of globin compensation adds mechanistic insight to the poorly understood phenomenon of stress-induced globin compensation and could inform strategies to treat hemoglobinopathies."	0
"32451441"	"Dynamin regulates the dynamics and mechanical strength of the actin cytoskeleton as a multifilament actin-bundling protein.The dynamin GTPase is known to bundle actin filaments, but the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological relevance remain unclear. Our genetic analyses revealed a function of dynamin in propelling invasive membrane protrusions during myoblast fusion in vivo. Using biochemistry, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we show that dynamin bundles actin while forming a helical structure. At its full capacity, each dynamin helix captures 12-16 actin filaments on the outer rim of the helix. GTP hydrolysis by dynamin triggers disassembly of fully assembled dynamin helices, releasing free dynamin dimers/tetramers and facilitating Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization. The assembly/disassembly cycles of dynamin promote continuous actin bundling to generate mechanically stiff actin super-bundles. Super-resolution and immunogold platinum replica electron microscopy revealed dynamin along actin bundles at the fusogenic synapse. These findings implicate dynamin as a unique multifilament actin-bundling protein that regulates the dynamics and mechanical strength of the actin cytoskeletal network."	0
"32109364"	"Visualizing the Role of Boundary Elements in Enhancer-Promoter Communication.Formation of self-associating loop domains is a fundamental organizational feature of metazoan genomes. Here, we employed quantitative live-imaging methods to visualize impacts of higher-order chromosome topology on enhancer-promoter communication in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that distal enhancers effectively produce transcriptional bursting from target promoters over distances when they are flanked with boundary elements. Importantly, neither inversion nor deletion of a boundary element abrogates this ""enhancer-assisting activity,"" suggesting that they can facilitate intra-domain enhancer-promoter interaction and production of transcriptional bursting independently of topologically associating domain (TAD) formation. In contrast, domain-skipping activity of distal enhancers was lost after disruption of topological domains. This observation raises a possibility that intra-domain and inter-domain enhancer-promoter interactions are differentially regulated by chromosome topology."	0
"32726614"	"Mitochondria and Peroxisome Remodeling across Cytomegalovirus Infection Time Viewed through the Lens of Inter-ViSTA.Nearly all biological processes rely on the finely tuned coordination of protein interactions across cellular space and time. Accordingly, generating protein interactomes has become routine in biological studies, yet interpreting these datasets remains computationally challenging. Here, we introduce Inter-ViSTA (Interaction Visualization in Space and Time Analysis), a web-based platform that quickly builds animated protein interaction networks and automatically synthesizes information on protein abundances, functions, complexes, and subcellular localizations. Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical for mitochondrial integrity. At the peroxisome, we show that pUL37x1 activates PEX11β to regulate fission, a key aspect of virus assembly and spread."	0
"32187542"	"Differential Modes of Orphan Subunit Recognition for the WRB/CAML Complex.A large proportion of membrane proteins must be assembled into oligomeric complexes for function. How this process occurs is poorly understood, but it is clear that complex assembly must be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of orphan subunits with potential cytotoxic effects. We interrogated assembly in mammalian cells by using the WRB/CAML complex, an essential insertase for tail-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as a model system. Our data suggest that the stability of each subunit is differentially regulated. In WRB's absence, CAML folds incorrectly, causing aberrant exposure of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain to the ER lumen. When present, WRB can correct the topology of CAML both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, WRB can independently fold correctly but is still degraded in the absence of CAML. We therefore propose that there are at least two distinct regulatory pathways for the surveillance of orphan subunits in the mammalian ER."	0
"32187540"	"Dead Cells Induce Innate Anergy via Mertk after Acute Viral Infection.Infections can result in a temporarily restricted unresponsiveness of the innate immune response, thereby limiting pathogen control. Mechanisms of such unresponsiveness are well studied in lipopolysaccharide tolerance; however, whether mechanisms of tolerance limit innate immunity during virus infection remains unknown. Here, we find that infection with the highly cytopathic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) leads to innate anergy for several days. Innate anergy is associated with induction of apoptotic cells, which activates the Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) receptor Mertk and induces high levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Lack of Mertk in Mertk<sup>-/-</sup> mice prevents induction of IL-10 and TGF-β, resulting in abrogation of innate anergy. Innate anergy is associated with enhanced VSV replication and poor survival after infection. Mechanistically, Mertk signaling upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3. Dexamethasone treatment upregulates Mertk and enhances innate anergy in a Mertk-dependent manner. In conclusion, we identify Mertk as one major regulator of innate tolerance during infection with VSV."	0

The composition of these ccfRNAs varies among biofluids. They constitute tantalizing biomarker candidates for several pathologies and have been demonstrated to be mediators of cellular communication. Little is known about their function in physiological and developmental settings, and most works are limited to in vitro studies. Here, we develop iTAG-RNA, a method for the unbiased tagging of RNA transcripts in mice in vivo. We use iTAG-RNA to isolate hepatocytes and kidney proximal epithelial cell-specific transcriptional responses to a dietary challenge without interfering with the tissue architecture and to identify multiple hepatocyte-secreted ccfRNAs in plasma. We also identify specific transfer of liver-derived ccfRNAs to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, where they likely constitute a buffering system to maintain lipid homeostasis under acute high-fat-diet feeding.

"32165409"	"<i>Drosophila</i> estrogen-related receptor directs a transcriptional switch that supports adult glycolysis and lipogenesis.Metabolism and development must be closely coupled to meet the changing physiological needs of each stage in the life cycle. The molecular mechanisms that link these pathways, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that the <i>Drosophila</i> estrogen-related receptor (<i>dERR</i>) directs a transcriptional switch in mid-pupae that promotes glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in young adults. <i>dERR</i> mutant adults are viable but display reduced locomotor activity, susceptibility to starvation, elevated glucose, and an almost complete lack of stored triglycerides. Molecular profiling by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and metabolomics revealed that glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway genes are induced by dERR, and their reduced expression in mutants is accompanied by elevated glycolytic intermediates, reduced TCA cycle intermediates, and reduced levels of long chain fatty acids. Unexpectedly, we found that the central pathways of energy metabolism, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain, are coordinately induced at the transcriptional level in mid-pupae and maintained into adulthood, and this response is partially dependent on <i>dERR</i>, leading to the metabolic defects observed in mutants. Our data support the model that <i>dERR</i> contributes to a transcriptional switch during pupal development that establishes the metabolic state of the adult fly."	0
"32755572"	"A Trio of Active Zone Proteins Comprised of RIM-BPs, RIMs, and Munc13s Governs Neurotransmitter Release.At the presynaptic active zone, action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release requires that fusion-competent synaptic vesicles are placed next to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The active zone resident proteins RIM, RBP, and Munc13 are essential contributors for vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel recruitment. Although the individual contributions of these scaffolds have been extensively studied, their respective functions in neurotransmission are still incompletely understood. Here, we analyze the functional interactions of RIMs, RBPs, and Munc13s at the genetic, molecular, functional, and ultrastructural levels in a mammalian synapse. We find that RBP, together with Munc13, promotes vesicle priming at the expense of RBP's role in recruiting presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, suggesting that the support of RBP for vesicle priming and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-secretion coupling is mutually exclusive. Our results demonstrate that the functional interaction of RIM, RBP, and Munc13 is more profound than previously envisioned, acting as a functional trio that govern basic and short-term plasticity properties of neurotransmission."	0

ARID1A is frequently mutated in various cancer types, but both mutation rates and expression levels of ARID1A are ubiquitously low in SCCs. Here, we reveal that excessive protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) contributes to the loss of ARID1A expression in SCC. We identify that the E3 ligase TRIM32 and the deubiquitinase USP11 play key roles in controlling ARID1A stability. TRIM32 depletion inhibits SCC cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance by stabilizing ARID1A, while USP11 depletion promotes SCC development by promoting ARID1A degradation. We show that syndecan-2 (SDC2) is the downstream target of both ARID1A and USP11 and that SDC2 depletion abolishes the oncogenic function of ARID1A loss. In summary, our data reveal UPS-mediated protein degradation as a mechanism underlying ARID1A loss and propose an important role for the TRIM32/USP11-ARID1A-SDC2 axis in SCC."	1
"31588022"	"Dinucleotide Degradation by REXO2 Maintains Promoter Specificity in Mammalian Mitochondria.Oligoribonucleases are conserved enzymes that degrade short RNA molecules of up to 5 nt in length and are assumed to constitute the final stage of RNA turnover.

A heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mouse displays elevated dinucleotide levels and alterations in gene expression patterns indicative of aberrant dinucleotide-primed transcription initiation. We find that dinucleotides act as potent stimulators of mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro. Our data demonstrate that increased levels of dinucleotides can be used to initiate transcription, leading to an increase in transcription levels from both mitochondrial promoters and other, nonspecific sequence elements in mitochondrial DNA. Efficient RNA turnover by REXO2 is thus required to maintain promoter specificity and proper regulation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria."	0
"32213323"	"Resolving the 3D Landscape of Transcription-Linked Mammalian Chromatin Folding.Whereas folding of genomes at the large scale of epigenomic compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) is now relatively well understood, how chromatin is folded at finer scales remains largely unexplored in mammals. Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P) and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation."	0

"31563432"	"Mediator Condensates Localize Signaling Factors to Key Cell Identity Genes.The gene expression programs that define the identity of each cell are controlled by master transcription factors (TFs) that bind cell-type-specific enhancers, as well as signaling factors, which bring extracellular stimuli to these enhancers. Recent studies have revealed that master TFs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator at super-enhancers. Here, we present evidence that signaling factors for the WNT, TGF-β, and JAK/STAT pathways use their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to enter and concentrate in Mediator condensates at super-enhancers. We show that the WNT coactivator β-catenin interacts both with components of condensates and DNA-binding factors to selectively occupy super-enhancer-associated genes. We propose that the cell-type specificity of the response to signaling is mediated in part by the IDRs of the signaling factors, which cause these factors to partition into condensates established by the master TFs and Mediator at genes with prominent roles in cell identity."	0

However, our ability to predict the editing outcome at specific sites is limited.

We find that precision of DNA editing (i.e., recurrence of a specific indel) varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly preferred indel and others displaying numerous infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency and a preference for single-nucleotide homologous insertions. Precise targets and editing outcome can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Indel profiles are robust, but they can be influenced by chromatin features. Our findings have important implications for clinical applications of CRISPR technology and reveal general patterns of broken end joining that can provide insights into DNA repair mechanisms."	0

Here we report evidence of histone crotonylation in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We define the enzymes that regulate crotonylation and show its dynamic control by environmental signals: carbon sources, the short-chain fatty acids butyrate and crotonate, and cell wall stress. Crotonate regulates stress-responsive transcription and rescues C. albicans from cell wall stress, indicating broad impact on cell biology. The YEATS domain crotonylation readers Taf14 and Yaf9 are required for C. albicans virulence, and Taf14 controls gene expression, stress resistance, and invasive growth via its chromatin reader function. Blocking the Taf14 C terminus with a tag reduced virulence, suggesting that inhibiting Taf14 interactions with chromatin regulators impairs function.

During infection, hGBP1 is recruited to pathogen-containing vacuoles, such as Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions, restricts pathogenic growth, and induces the activation of the inflammasome pathway. hGBP1 has a unique catalytic activity to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in two consecutive cleavage steps. However, the functional significance of this activity in host defense remains elusive. Here, we generate a structure-guided mutant that specifically abrogates GMP production, while maintaining fast cooperative GTP hydrolysis. Complementation experiments in human monocytes/macrophages show that hGBP1-mediated GMP production is dispensable for restricting Chlamydia trachomatis growth but is necessary for inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, GMP is catabolized to uric acid, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our study demonstrates that the unique enzymology of hGBP1 coordinates bacterial growth restriction and inflammasome signaling."	0
"32187559"	"Identification of ALPPL2 as a Naive Pluripotent State-Specific Surface Protein Essential for Human Naive Pluripotency Regulation.Human naive pluripotent stem cells established from the epiblasts of preimplantation blastocysts provide a useful model for mechanistic studies of pluripotency regulation and lineage differentiation. Important advances have been made to optimize culture conditions and define molecular criteria for naive pluripotency. However, the identity of naive-specific surface markers and the underlying molecular mechanism of naive pluripotency regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) as a prominent naive-specific surface marker by systematic proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ALPPL2 is essential for both the establishment and maintenance of naive pluripotency. Moreover, we show that ALPPL2 can interact with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 to stabilize the mRNA levels of the naive pluripotency transcription factors TFCP2L1 and STAT3 to regulate naive pluripotency. Overall, our study identifies a functional surface marker for human naive pluripotency, providing a powerful tool for human-naive-pluripotency-related mechanistic studies."	1
"30853402"	"The Cargo Receptor NDP52 Initiates Selective Autophagy by Recruiting the ULK Complex to Cytosol-Invading Bacteria.Xenophagy, a selective autophagy pathway that protects the cytosol against bacterial invasion, relies on cargo receptors that juxtapose bacteria and phagophore membranes. Whether phagophores are recruited from a constitutive pool or are generated de novo at prospective cargo remains unknown. Phagophore formation in situ would require recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery to prospective cargo. Here, we show that, essential for anti-bacterial autophagy, the cargo receptor NDP52 forms a trimeric complex with FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1, which are subunits of the autophagy-initiating ULK and the TBK1 kinase complex, respectively. FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1 are each recruited independently to bacteria via NDP52, as revealed by selective point mutations in their respective binding sites, but only in their combined presence does xenophagy proceed. Such recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery by NDP52 reveals how detection of cargo-associated ""eat me"" signals, induction of autophagy, and juxtaposition of cargo and phagophores are integrated in higher eukaryotes."	1
"32647006"	"A kinase cascade on the yeast lysosomal vacuole regulates its membrane dynamics: conserved kinase Env7 is phosphorylated by casein kinase Yck3.Membrane fusion/fission is a highly dynamic and conserved process that responds to intra- and extracellular signals. Whereas the molecular machineries involved in membrane fusion/fission have been dissected, regulation of membrane dynamics remains poorly understood. The lysosomal vacuole of budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) has served as a seminal model in studies of membrane dynamics. We have previously established that yeast <i>ENV7</i> encodes an ortholog of STK16-related kinases that localizes to the vacuolar membrane and downregulates vacuolar membrane fusion. Additionally, we have previously reported that Env7 phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i> depends on <i>YCK3</i>, a gene that encodes a vacuolar membrane casein kinase I (CKI) homolog that nonredundantly functions in fusion regulation. Here, we report that Env7 physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by Yck3. We also establish that Env7 vacuole fusion/fission regulation and vacuolar localization are mediated through its Yck3-dependent phosphorylation. Through extensive site-directed mutagenesis, we map phosphorylation to the Env7 C terminus and confirm that Ser-331 is a primary and preferred phosphorylation site. Phospho-deficient Env7 mutants were defective in negative regulation of membrane fusion, increasing the number of prominent vacuoles, whereas a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-331 increased the number of fragmented vacuoles. Bioinformatics approaches confirmed that Env7 Ser-331 is within a motif that is highly conserved in STK16-related kinases and that it also anchors an SXXS CKI phosphorylation motif (<sub>328</sub>SRFS<sub>331</sub>). This study represents the first report on the regulatory mechanism of an STK16-related kinase. It also points to regulation of vacuolar membrane dynamics via a novel Yck3-Env7 kinase cascade."	1
"32820037"	"Phf21b imprints the spatiotemporal epigenetic switch essential for neural stem cell differentiation.Cerebral cortical development in mammals involves a highly complex and organized set of events including the transition of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) from proliferative to differentiative divisions to generate neurons. Despite progress, the spatiotemporal regulation of this proliferation-differentiation switch during neurogenesis and the upstream epigenetic triggers remain poorly known. Here we report a cortex-specific PHD finger protein, Phf21b, which is highly expressed in the neurogenic phase of cortical development and gets induced as NSCs begin to differentiate. Depletion of Phf21b in vivo inhibited neuronal differentiation as cortical progenitors lacking Phf21b were retained in the proliferative zones and underwent faster cell cycles. Mechanistically, Phf21b targets the regulatory regions of cell cycle promoting genes by virtue of its high affinity for monomethylated H3K4. Subsequently, Phf21b recruits the lysine-specific demethylase Lsd1 and histone deacetylase Hdac2, resulting in the simultaneous removal of monomethylation from H3K4 and acetylation from H3K27, respectively. Intriguingly, mutations in the Phf21b locus associate with depression and mental retardation in humans. Taken together, these findings establish how a precisely timed spatiotemporal expression of Phf21b creates an epigenetic program that triggers neural stem cell differentiation during cortical development."	0

Circuit and synaptic mechanisms that integrate these cues with head-direction (HD) signals remain, however, unclear. We identify an excitatory synaptic projection from the presubiculum (PreS) and the multisensory-associative retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to the anterodorsal thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), so far classically implied in gating sensory information flow. In vitro, projections to TRN involve AMPA/NMDA-type glutamate receptors that initiate TRN cell burst discharge and feedforward inhibition of anterior thalamic nuclei. In vivo, chemogenetic anterodorsal TRN inhibition modulates PreS/RSC-induced anterior thalamic firing dynamics, broadens the tuning of thalamic HD cells, and leads to preferential use of allo- over egocentric search strategies in the Morris water maze. TRN-dependent thalamic inhibition is thus an integral part of limbic navigational circuits wherein it coordinates external sensory and internal HD signals to regulate the choice of search strategies during spatial navigation."	0

Caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways-apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively-regulate immunogenicity by the release of distinct sets of cellular proteins. To obtain an unbiased, systems-level understanding of this important process, we here applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to dissect protein release during apoptosis and necroptosis. We report hundreds of proteins released from human myeloid cells in time course experiments. Both cell death types induce receptor shedding, but only apoptotic cells released nucleosome components. Conversely, necroptotic cells release lysosomal components by activating lysosomal exocytosis at early stages of necroptosis-induced membrane permeabilization and show reduced release of conventionally secreted cytokines."	0

"31831627"	"Induction of AP-1 by YAP/TAZ contributes to cell proliferation and organ growth.Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homolog transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are key effectors of the Hippo pathway to control cell growth and organ size, of which dysregulation yields to tumorigenesis or hypertrophy. Upon activation, YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus and bind to TEAD transcription factors to promote transcriptional programs for proliferation or cell specification. Immediate early genes, represented by AP-1 complex, are rapidly induced and control later-phase transcriptional program to play key roles in tumorigenesis and organ maintenance. Here, we report that YAP/TAZ directly promote <i>FOS</i> transcription that in turn contributes to the biological function of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ bind to the promoter region of <i>FOS</i> to stimulate its transcription. Deletion of YAP/TAZ blocks the induction of immediate early genes in response to mitogenic stimuli. <i>FOS</i> induction contributes to expression of YAP/TAZ downstream target genes. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of AP-1 suppresses growth of YAP-driven cancer cells, such as <i>Lats1/2</i>-deficient cancer cells as well as Gα<sub>q/11</sub> mutated uveal melanoma. Furthermore, AP-1 inhibition almost completely abrogates the hepatomegaly induced by YAP overexpression. Our findings reveal a feed-forward interplay between immediate early transcription of AP-1 and Hippo pathway function."	1
"32937134"	"Astrocyte- and Neuron-Derived CXCL1 Drives Neutrophil Transmigration and Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability in Viral Encephalitis.Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 encephalitis has significant morbidity partly because of an over-exuberant immune response characterized by leukocyte infiltration into the brain and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Determining the role of specific leukocyte subsets and the factors that mediate their recruitment into the brain is critical to developing targeted immune therapies. In a murine model, we find that the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2 are induced in the brain following HSV-1 infection. Ccr2 (CCL2 receptor)-deficient mice have reduced monocyte recruitment, uncontrolled viral replication, and increased morbidity. Contrastingly, Cxcr2 (CXCL1 receptor)-deficient mice exhibit markedly reduced neutrophil recruitment, BBB permeability, and morbidity, without influencing viral load. CXCL1 is produced by astrocytes in response to HSV-1 and by astrocytes and neurons in response to IL-1α, and it is the critical ligand required for neutrophil transendothelial migration, which correlates with BBB breakdown. Thus, the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis represents an attractive therapeutic target to limit neutrophil-mediated morbidity in HSV-1 encephalitis."	0
"32101741"	"Hedgehog Signaling Modulates Glial Proteostasis and Lifespan.The conserved Hedgehog signaling pathway has well-established roles in development. However, its function during adulthood remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether the Hedgehog signaling pathway is active during adult life in Drosophila melanogaster, and we uncovered a protective function for Hedgehog signaling in coordinating correct proteostasis in glial cells. Adult-specific depletion of Hedgehog reduces lifespan, locomotor activity, and dopaminergic neuron integrity. Conversely, increased expression of Hedgehog extends lifespan and improves fitness. Moreover, Hedgehog pathway activation in glia rescues the lifespan and age-associated defects of hedgehog mutants. The Hedgehog pathway regulates downstream chaperones, whose overexpression in glial cells was sufficient to rescue the shortened lifespan and proteostasis defects of hedgehog mutants. Finally, we demonstrate the protective ability of Hedgehog signaling in a Drosophila Alzheimer's disease model expressing human amyloid beta in the glia. Overall, we propose that Hedgehog signaling is requisite for lifespan determination and correct proteostasis in glial cells."	0
"32807903"	"Decapping enzyme 1A breaks X-chromosome symmetry by controlling Tsix elongation and RNA turnover.How allelic asymmetry is generated remains a major unsolved problem in epigenetics. Here we model the problem using X-chromosome inactivation by developing ""BioRBP"", an enzymatic RNA-proteomic method that enables probing of low-abundance interactions and an allelic RNA-depletion and -tagging system. We identify messenger RNA-decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A) as a key regulator of Tsix, a noncoding RNA implicated in allelic choice through X-chromosome pairing. DCP1A controls Tsix half-life and transcription elongation. Depleting DCP1A causes accumulation of X-X pairs and perturbs the transition to monoallelic Tsix expression required for Xist upregulation. While ablating DCP1A causes hyperpairing, forcing Tsix degradation resolves pairing and enables Xist upregulation. We link pairing to allelic partitioning of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and show that tethering DCP1A to one Tsix allele is sufficient to drive monoallelic Xist expression. Thus, DCP1A flips a bistable switch for the mutually exclusive determination of active and inactive Xs."	1
"32130897"	"Interplay of Staphylococcal and Host Proteases Promotes Skin Barrier Disruption in Netherton Syndrome.Netherton syndrome (NS) is a monogenic skin disease resulting from loss of function of lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related protease inhibitor (LEKTI-1). In this study we examine if bacteria residing on the skin are influenced by the loss of LEKTI-1 and if interaction between this human gene and resident bacteria contributes to skin disease. Shotgun sequencing of the skin microbiome demonstrates that lesional skin of NS subjects is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). Isolates of either species from NS subjects are able to induce skin inflammation and barrier damage on mice. These microbes promote skin inflammation in the setting of LEKTI-1 deficiency due to excess proteolytic activity promoted by S. aureus phenol-soluble modulin α as well as increased bacterial proteases staphopain A and B from S. aureus or EcpA from S. epidermidis.

"31023583"	"ER and Nutrient Stress Promote Assembly of Respiratory Chain Supercomplexes through the PERK-eIF2α Axis.Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response are energetically challenging under nutrient stress conditions. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control the energetic demand under nutrient and ER stress are largely unknown. Here we show that ER stress and glucose deprivation stimulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and formation of respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) through protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK). Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of PERK suppresses nutrient and ER stress-mediated increases in SC levels and reduces oxidative phosphorylation-dependent ATP production. Conversely, PERK activation augments respiratory SCs. The PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 axis increases supercomplex assembly factor 1 (SCAF1 or COX7A2L), promoting SCs and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. PERK activation is sufficient to rescue bioenergetic defects caused by complex I missense mutations derived from mitochondrial disease patients. These studies have identified an energetic communication between ER and mitochondria, with implications in cell survival and diseases associated with mitochondrial failures."	1

However, the roles of specific tsRNAs in early embryo development remain to be elucidated. Here, using pigs as a research model, we probed the tsRNA dynamics during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation and demonstrated the delivery of tsRNAs from semen-derived exosomes to spermatozoa. By microinjection of antisense sequences into <i>in vitro</i> fertilized oocytes and subsequent single-cell RNA-seq of embryos, we identified a specific functional tsRNA group (termed here Gln-TTGs) that participate in the early cleavage of porcine preimplantation embryos, probably by regulating cell cycle-associated genes and retrotransposons.

Here, we demonstrate that murine LN stromal cells (LNSCs) suppress the formation of autoreactive T<sub>FH</sub> cells in an antigen-specific manner, thereby significantly reducing germinal center B cell responses directed against the same self-antigen. Mechanistically, LNSCs express and present self-antigens in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, leading to the conversion of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into T regulatory (T<sub>REG</sub>) cells in an interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent manner. Upon blockade of T<sub>REG</sub> cells, using neutralizing IL-2 antibodies, autoreactive T<sub>FH</sub> cells are allowed to develop.

Our findings uncover the ability of LNSCs to suppress the early activation of autoreactive immune cells and maintain peripheral tolerance."	0

How FBXL21 regulates tissue-specific circadian physiology and what mechanism operates upstream is poorly understood. Here we report the sarcomere component TCAP as a cytoplasmic substrate of FBXL21. FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation. GSK-3β phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP to activate FBXL21-mediated, phosphodegron-dependent TCAP degradation. GSK-3β inhibition or knockdown diminishes FBXL21-Cul1 complex formation and delays FBXL21-mediated TCAP degradation. Finally, Psttm mice show significant skeletal muscle defects, including impaired fiber size, exercise tolerance, grip strength, and response to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy, in conjunction with cardiac dysfunction. These data highlight a circadian regulatory pathway where a GSK-3β-FBXL21 functional axis controls TCAP degradation via SCF complex formation and regulates skeletal muscle function."	1
"31924448"	"Antisense-Mediated Transcript Knockdown Triggers Premature Transcription Termination.Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that trigger RNase-H-mediated cleavage are commonly used to knock down transcripts for experimental or therapeutic purposes. In particular, ASOs are frequently used to functionally interrogate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and discriminate lncRNA loci that produce functional RNAs from those whose activity is attributable to the act of transcription. Transcription termination is triggered by cleavage of nascent transcripts, generally during polyadenylation, resulting in degradation of the residual RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated RNA by XRN2 and dissociation of elongating Pol II. Here, we show that ASOs act upon nascent transcripts and, consequently, induce premature transcription termination downstream of the cleavage site in an XRN2-dependent manner. Targeting the transcript 3' end with ASOs, however, allows transcript knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the gene body. These results demonstrate that the effects of ASOs on transcription must be considered for appropriate experimental and therapeutic use of these reagents."	0

"32139423"	"The adrenergic-induced ERK3 pathway drives lipolysis and suppresses energy dissipation.Obesity-induced diabetes affects >400 million people worldwide. Uncontrolled lipolysis (free fatty acid release from adipocytes) can contribute to diabetes and obesity. To identify future therapeutic avenues targeting this pathway, we performed a high-throughput screen and identified the extracellular-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) as a hit. We demonstrated that β-adrenergic stimulation stabilizes ERK3, leading to the formation of a complex with the cofactor MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), thereby driving lipolysis. Mechanistically, we identified a downstream target of the ERK3/MK5 pathway, the transcription factor FOXO1, which promotes the expression of the major lipolytic enzyme ATGL. Finally, we provide evidence that targeted deletion of ERK3 in mouse adipocytes inhibits lipolysis, but elevates energy dissipation, promoting lean phenotype and ameliorating diabetes. Thus, ERK3/MK5 represents a previously unrecognized signaling axis in adipose tissue and an attractive target for future therapies aiming to combat obesity-induced diabetes."	1

Previously, we obtained a mutant of <i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i> HH103, <i>rkpA</i>, that does not produce KPS, a homopolysaccharide of a pseudaminic acid derivative, but whose LPS electrophoretic profile was indistinguishable from that of the WT strain. We also previously demonstrated that the HH103 <i>rkpLMNOPQ</i> operon is responsible for 5-acetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-7-(3-hydroxybutyramido)-l-<i>glycero</i>-l-<i>manno</i>-nonulosonic acid [Pse5NAc7(3OHBu)] production and is involved in HH103 KPS and LPS biosynthesis and that an HH103 <i>rkpM</i> mutant cannot produce KPS and displays an altered LPS structure. Here, we analyzed the LPS structure of HH103 <i>rkpA</i>, focusing on the carbohydrate portion, and found that it contains a highly heterogeneous lipid A and a peculiar core oligosaccharide composed of an unusually high number of hexuronic acids containing β-configured Pse5NAc7(3OHBu). This pseudaminic acid derivative, in its α-configuration, was the only structural component of the <i>S. fredii</i> HH103 KPS and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported from any other rhizobial LPS.

This eukaryote-specific appended domain also plays a critical role in hLysRS nuclear localization, thus facilitating noncanonical functions of hLysRS. The structure is intrinsically disordered and therefore remains poorly characterized. Findings of previous studies are consistent with the Nterm domain undergoing a conformational transition to an ordered structure upon nucleic acid binding. In this study, we used NMR to investigate how the type of RNA, as well as the presence of the adjacent anticodon-binding domain (ACB), influences the Nterm conformation. To explore the latter, we used sortase A ligation to produce a segmentally labeled tandem-domain protein, Nterm-ACB. In the absence of RNA, Nterm remained disordered regardless of ACB attachment. Both alone and when attached to ACB, Nterm structure remained unaffected by titration with single-stranded RNAs. The central region of the Nterm domain adopted α-helical structure upon titration of Nterm and Nterm-ACB with RNA hairpins containing double-stranded regions. Nterm binding to the RNA hairpins resulted in CD spectral shifts consistent with an induced helical structure. NMR and fluorescence anisotropy revealed that Nterm binding to hairpin RNAs is weak but that the binding affinity increases significantly upon covalent attachment to ACB. We conclude that the ACB domain facilitates induced-fit conformational changes and confers high-affinity RNA hairpin binding, which may be advantageous for functional interactions of LysRS with a variety of different binding partners."	0

Whether NAC exerts chaperone activity and whether this function is restricted to de novo protein synthesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NAC directly exerts chaperone activity toward structurally diverse model substrates including polyglutamine (PolyQ) proteins, firefly luciferase, and Aβ40. Strikingly, we identified the positively charged ribosome-binding domain in the N terminus of the βNAC subunit (N-βNAC) as a major chaperone entity of NAC. N-βNAC by itself suppressed aggregation of PolyQ-expanded proteins in vitro, and the positive charge of this domain was critical for this activity. Moreover, we found that NAC also exerts a ribosome-independent chaperone function in vivo. Consistently, we found that a substantial fraction of NAC is non-ribosomal bound in higher eukaryotes. In sum, NAC is a potent suppressor of aggregation and proteotoxicity of mutant PolyQ-expanded proteins associated with human diseases like Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias."	0

Using biochemical fractionation and proteomics, we found that Ambra1 binds to multiple classes of proteins in the nucleus, including nuclear pore proteins, adaptor proteins such as FAK and Akap8, chromatin-modifying proteins, and transcriptional regulators like Brg1 and Atf2. We identified biologically important genes, such as <i>Angpt1</i>, <i>Tgfb2</i>, <i>Tgfb3</i>, <i>Itga8</i>, and <i>Itgb7</i>, whose transcription is regulated by Ambra1-scaffolded complexes, likely by altering histone modifications and Atf2 activity.

This novel function for Ambra1, and the specific genes impacted, may help to explain the wider role of Ambra1 in cancer cell biology."	1

Expression of αvβ5 is correlated with ZIKV susceptibility in various cells and tropism in developing human cerebral cortex. A blocking antibody against integrin αvβ5, but not αvβ3, efficiently inhibits ZIKV infection. ZIKV binds to cells but fails to internalize when treated with integrin αvβ5-blocking antibody. αvβ5 directly binds to ZIKV virions and activates focal adhesion kinase, which is required for ZIKV infection. Finally, αvβ5 blocking antibody or two inhibitors, SB273005 and cilengitide, reduces ZIKV infection and alleviates ZIKV-induced pathology in human neural stem cells and in mouse brain. Altogether, our findings identify integrin αvβ5 as an internalization factor for ZIKV, providing a promising therapeutic target, as well as two drug candidates for prophylactic use or treatments for ZIKV infections."	0

Once activated, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway induces both type I interferon (IFN) expression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated cytokine production. Currently, these two signaling arms are thought to be mediated by a single upstream kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that TBK1 alone is dispensable for STING-induced NF-κB responses in human and mouse immune cells, as well as in vivo. We further demonstrate that TBK1 acts redundantly with IκB kinase ε (IKKε) to drive NF-κB upon STING activation. Interestingly, we show that activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is highly dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, whereas NF-κB is significantly less sensitive to TBK1/IKKε kinase inhibition. Our work redefines signaling events downstream of cGAS-STING. Our findings further suggest that cGAS-STING will need to be targeted directly to effectively ameliorate the inflammation underpinning disorders associated with STING hyperactivity."	1

Several ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) family members were reported to regulate type I IFN production and host antiviral immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we report that UBE2S acts as a negative regulator in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of UBE2S inhibits host antiviral immune responses and enhances viral replications, whereas deficiency of UBE2S enhances host antiviral immune responses and suppresses viral replications both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of type І IFN production by UBE2S is independent on its E2 and E3 enzymic activity. Mechanistically, UBE2S interacts with TBK1 and recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) to remove Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains of TBK1.

Pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TAM kinases results in a potent inhibition of necroptotic death in various cellular models. We identify phosphorylation of MLKL Tyr376 as a direct point of input from TAM kinases into the necroptosis signaling. The oligomerization of MLKL, but not its membranal translocation or phosphorylation by RIPK3, is controlled by TAM kinases. Importantly, both knockout and inhibition of TAM kinases protect mice from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, this study discovers that immunosuppressant TAM kinases are promoters of pro-inflammatory necroptosis, shedding light on the biological complexity of the regulation of inflammation."	1
"31402097"	"Osh Proteins Control Nanoscale Lipid Organization Necessary for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> Synthesis.The plasma membrane (PM) is composed of a complex lipid mixture that forms heterogeneous membrane environments. Yet, how small-scale lipid organization controls physiological events at the PM remains largely unknown. Here, we show that ORP-related Osh lipid exchange proteins are critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>], a key regulator of dynamic events at the PM. In real-time assays, we find that unsaturated phosphatidylserine (PS) and sterols, both Osh protein ligands, synergistically stimulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) activity. Biophysical FRET analyses suggest an unconventional co-distribution of unsaturated PS and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) species in sterol-containing membrane bilayers. Moreover, using in vivo imaging approaches and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Osh protein-mediated unsaturated PI4P and PS membrane lipid organization is sensed by the PIP5K specificity loop. Thus, ORP family members create a nanoscale membrane lipid environment that drives PIP5K activity and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis that ultimately controls global PM organization and dynamics."	1
"32692974"	"Translational Repression of G3BP in Cancer and Germ Cells Suppresses Stress Granules and Enhances Stress Tolerance.Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less ribonucleoprotein condensates that form in response to various stress stimuli via phase separation. SGs act as a protective mechanism to cope with acute stress, but persistent SGs have cytotoxic effects that are associated with several age-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the testis-specific protein, MAGE-B2, increases cellular stress tolerance by suppressing SG formation through translational inhibition of the key SG nucleator G3BP. MAGE-B2 reduces G3BP protein levels below the critical concentration for phase separation and suppresses SG initiation. Knockout of the MAGE-B2 mouse ortholog or overexpression of G3BP1 confers hypersensitivity of the male germline to heat stress in vivo. Thus, MAGE-B2 provides cytoprotection to maintain mammalian spermatogenesis, a highly thermosensitive process that must be preserved throughout reproductive life. These results demonstrate a mechanism that allows for tissue-specific resistance against stress and could aid in the development of male fertility therapies."	1
"32075771"	"A Two-Layered Targeting Mechanism Underlies Nuclear RNA Sorting by the Human Exosome.Degradation of transcripts in human nuclei is primarily facilitated by the RNA exosome. To obtain substrate specificity, the exosome is aided by adaptors; in the nucleoplasm, those adaptors are the nuclear exosome-targeting (NEXT) complex and the poly(A) (pA) exosome-targeting (PAXT) connection. How these adaptors guide exosome targeting remains enigmatic. Employing high-resolution 3' end sequencing, we demonstrate that NEXT substrates arise from heterogenous and predominantly pA<sup>-</sup> 3' ends often covering kilobase-wide genomic regions. In contrast, PAXT targets harbor well-defined pA<sup>+</sup> 3' ends defined by canonical pA site use. Irrespective of this clear division, NEXT and PAXT act redundantly in two ways: (1) regional redundancy, where the majority of exosome-targeted transcription units produce NEXT- and PAXT-sensitive RNA isoforms, and (2) isoform redundancy, where the PAXT connection ensures fail-safe decay of post-transcriptionally polyadenylated NEXT targets. In conjunction, this provides a two-layered targeting mechanism for efficient nuclear sorting of the human transcriptome."	0

Lenalidomide (LEN) is the treatment of choice for patients with del(5q) MDS, but half of the responding patients become resistant<sup>2</sup> within 2 years. TP53 mutations are detected in ~20% of LEN-resistant patients<sup>3</sup>. Here we show that patients who become resistant to LEN harbour recurrent variants of TP53 or RUNX1. LEN upregulated RUNX1 protein and function in a CRBN- and TP53-dependent manner in del(5q) cells, and mutation or downregulation of RUNX1 rendered cells resistant to LEN. LEN induced megakaryocytic differentiation of del(5q) cells followed by cell death that was dependent on calpain activation and CSNK1A1 degradation<sup>4,5</sup>. We also identified GATA2 as a LEN-responsive gene that is required for LEN-induced megakaryocyte differentiation. Megakaryocytic gene-promoter analyses suggested that LEN-induced degradation of IKZF1 enables a RUNX1-GATA2 complex to drive megakaryocytic differentiation. Overexpression of GATA2 restored LEN sensitivity in the context of RUNX1 or TP53 mutations by enhancing LEN-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Screening for mutations that block LEN-induced megakaryocytic differentiation should identify patients who are resistant to LEN."	0
"30527665"	"Phosphorylated RB Promotes Cancer Immunity by Inhibiting NF-κB Activation and PD-L1 Expression.Aberrant expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells promotes cancer progression by suppressing cancer immunity. The retinoblastoma protein RB is a tumor suppressor known to regulate the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that RB interacts with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) protein p65 and that their interaction is primarily dependent on CDK4/6-mediated serine-249/threonine-252 (S249/T252) phosphorylation of RB. RNA-seq analysis shows a subset of NF-κB pathway genes including PD-L1 are selectively upregulated by RB knockdown or CDK4/6 inhibitor. S249/T252-phosphorylated RB inversely correlates with PD-L1 expression in patient samples. Expression of a RB-derived S249/T252 phosphorylation-mimetic peptide suppresses radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 and augments therapeutic efficacy of radiation in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of hyperphosphorylated RB in suppressing NF-κB activity and PD-L1 expression and suggest that the RB-NF-κB axis can be exploited to overcome cancer immune evasion triggered by conventional or targeted therapies."	1
"32160541"	"Inter-dependent Centrosomal Co-localization of the cen and ik2 cis-Natural Antisense mRNAs in Drosophila.Overlapping genes are prevalent in most genomes, but the extent to which this organization influences regulatory events operating at the post-transcriptional level remains unclear. Studying the cen and ik2 genes of Drosophila melanogaster, which are convergently transcribed as cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) with overlapping 3' UTRs, we found that their encoded mRNAs strikingly co-localize to centrosomes. These transcripts physically interact in a 3' UTR-dependent manner, and the targeting of ik2 requires its 3' UTR sequence and the presence of cen mRNA, which serves as the main driver of centrosomal co-localization. The cen transcript undergoes localized translation in proximity to centrosomes, and its localization is perturbed by polysome-disrupting drugs. By interrogating global fractionation-sequencing datasets generated from Drosophila and human cellular models, we find that RNAs expressed as cis-NATs tend to co-localize to specific subcellular fractions. This work suggests that post-transcriptional interactions between RNAs with complementary sequences can dictate their localization fate in the cytoplasm."	0
"30612879"	"The Crohn's Disease Risk Factor IRGM Limits NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Impeding Its Assembly and by Mediating Its Selective Autophagy.Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn's disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders."	1

"30554947"	"Molecular Basis for the Single-Nucleotide Precision of Primary microRNA Processing.Microprocessor, composed of DROSHA and its cofactor DGCR8, initiates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis by processing the primary transcripts of miRNA (pri-miRNAs). Here we investigate the mechanism by which Microprocessor selects the cleavage site with single-nucleotide precision, which is crucial for the specificity and functionality of miRNAs. By testing ∼40,000 pri-miRNA variants, we find that for some pri-miRNAs the cleavage site is dictated mainly by the mGHG motif embedded in the lower stem region of pri-miRNA. Structural modeling and deep-sequencing-based complementation experiments show that the double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of DROSHA recognizes mGHG to place the catalytic center in the appropriate position. The mGHG motif as well as the mGHG-recognizing residues in DROSHA dsRBD are conserved across eumetazoans, suggesting that this mechanism emerged in an early ancestor of the animal lineage. Our findings provide a basis for the understanding of miRNA biogenesis and rational design of accurate small-RNA-based gene silencing."	0
"31278054"	"TSPYL5 Depletion Induces Specific Death of ALT Cells through USP7-Dependent Proteasomal Degradation of POT1.A significant fraction (∼10%) of cancer cells maintain their telomere length via a telomerase-independent mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). There are no known molecular, ALT-specific, therapeutic targets. We have identified TSPYL5 (testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 5) as a PML body component, co-localizing with ALT telomeres and critical for ALT<sup>+</sup> cell viability. TSPYL5 was described as an inhibitor of the USP7 deubiquitinase. We report that TSPYL5 prevents the poly-ubiquitination of POT1-a shelterin component-and protects POT1 from proteasomal degradation exclusively in ALT<sup>+</sup> cells. USP7 depletion rescued POT1 poly-ubiquitination and loss, suggesting that the deubiquitinase activates POT1 E3 ubiquitin ligase(s). Similarly, PML depletion suppressed POT1 poly-ubiquitination, suggesting an interplay between USP7 and PML to trigger POT1 degradation in TSPYL5-depleted ALT<sup>+</sup> cells. We demonstrate that ALT telomeres need to be protected from POT1 degradation in ALT-associated PML bodies and identify TSPYL5 as an ALT<sup>+</sup> cancer-specific therapeutic target."	1
"32268089"	"Plasma Cell Fate Is Orchestrated by Elaborate Changes in Genome Compartmentalization and Inter-chromosomal Hubs.The transition from the follicular B to the plasma cell stage is associated with large-scale changes in cell morphology. Here, we examine whether plasma cell development is also associated with changes in nuclear architecture. We find that the onset of plasma cell development is concomitant with a decline in remote genomic interactions; a gain in euchromatic character at loci encoding for factors that specify plasma cell fate, including Prdm1 and Atf4; and establishment of de novo inter-chromosomal hubs. We find that, in developing plasma cells and concurrent with transcriptional silencing, the Ebf1 locus repositions from an euchromatic to peri-centromeric heterochromatic environment. Finally, we find that inter-chromosomal hubs are enriched for the deposition of either H3K27Ac or H3K27me3. These data indicate that plasma cell fate is orchestrated by elaborate changes in genome topology and that epigenetic marks, linked with super-enhancers or transcriptionally repressed regions, are enriched at inter-chromosomal hubs."	0

"32668247"	"Zinc Finger Protein St18 Protects against Septic Death by Inhibiting VEGF-A from Macrophages.Zinc finger protein St18 was initially reported as candidate tumor suppressor gene, and also suggested that fibroblast St18 positively regulates NF-κB activation. Despite the pleiotropic functions of St18, little is known about its roles in macrophages. Here, we report that myeloid St18 is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A. Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation. Mechanistically, St18 directly binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A. Using mouse genetic and pharmacological models, we reveal myeloid St18 as a critical septic death protector."	1
"32442398"	"A Mechanism for microRNA Arm Switching Regulated by Uridylation.Strand selection is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Although the dominant strand may change depending on cellular contexts, the molecular mechanism and physiological significance of such alternative strand selection (or ""arm switching"") remain elusive. Here we find miR-324 to be one of the strongly regulated miRNAs by arm switching and identify the terminal uridylyl transferases TUT4 and TUT7 to be the key regulators. Uridylation of pre-miR-324 by TUT4/7 re-positions DICER on the pre-miRNA and shifts the cleavage site. This alternative processing produces a duplex with a different terminus from which the 3' strand (3p) is selected instead of the 5' strand (5p). In glioblastoma, the TUT4/7 and 3p levels are upregulated, whereas the 5p level is reduced. Manipulation of the strand ratio is sufficient to impair glioblastoma cell proliferation. This study uncovers a role of uridylation as a molecular switch in alternative strand selection and implicates its therapeutic potential."	0

However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in human cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene <i>RAB39b</i> are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain remain unknown. We generated <i>Rab39b</i> knockout (KO) mice and found that they exhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD behaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human cerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation and impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble neurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b interacts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly enhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely detectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling rescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by <i>RAB39b</i> mutations. Therefore, <i>RAB39b</i> mutation promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity and alters cortical neurogenesis, leading to macrocephaly and autistic-like behaviors.

"32049003"	"A Requirement for Argonaute 4 in Mammalian Antiviral Defense.While interferon (IFN) responses are critical for mammalian antiviral defense, induction of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) is evident. To date, individual functions of the mammalian RNAi and micro RNA (miRNA) effector proteins Argonautes 1-4 (AGO1-AGO4) during virus infection remain undetermined. AGO2 was recently implicated in mammalian antiviral defense, so we examined antiviral activity of AGO1, AGO3, or AGO4 in IFN-competent immune cells. Only AGO4-deficient cells are hyper-susceptible to virus infection. AGO4 antiviral function is both IFN dependent and IFN independent, since AGO4 promotes IFN but also maintains antiviral capacity following prevention of IFN signaling or production. We identified AGO-loaded virus-derived short interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs), a molecular marker of antiviral RNAi, in macrophages infected with influenza or influenza lacking the IFN and RNAi suppressor NS1, which are uniquely diminished without AGO4. Importantly, AGO4-deficient influenza-infected mice have significantly higher burden and viral titers in vivo. Together, our data assign an essential role for AGO4 in mammalian antiviral defense."	0
"31000437"	"Regulation of UCP1 and Mitochondrial Metabolism in Brown Adipose Tissue by Reversible Succinylation.Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and plays important roles in energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. We find that levels of mitochondrial protein succinylation and malonylation are high in BAT and subject to physiological and genetic regulation. BAT-specific deletion of Sirt5, a mitochondrial desuccinylase and demalonylase, results in dramatic increases in global protein succinylation and malonylation. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of succinylation reveals that Sirt5 regulates the key thermogenic protein in BAT, UCP1. Mutation of the two succinylated lysines in UCP1 to acyl-mimetic glutamine and glutamic acid significantly decreases its stability and activity. The reduced function of UCP1 and other proteins in Sirt5KO BAT results in impaired mitochondria respiration, defective mitophagy, and metabolic inflexibility. Thus, succinylation of UCP1 and other mitochondrial proteins plays an important role in BAT and in regulation of energy homeostasis."	1
"31914393"	"TACC3 Regulates Microtubule Plus-End Dynamics and Cargo Transport in Interphase Cells.End-binding proteins (EBs) are widely viewed as master regulators of microtubule dynamics and function. Here, we show that while EB1 mediates the dynamic microtubule capture of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in fibroblasts, in neuronal cells, infection occurs independently of EBs through stable microtubules. Prompted by this, we find that transforming acid coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), widely studied in mitotic spindle formation, regulates the cytoplasmic localization of the microtubule polymerizing factor chTOG and influences microtubule plus-end dynamics during interphase to control infection in distinct cell types. Furthermore, perturbing TACC3 function in neuronal cells resulted in the formation of disorganized stable, detyrosinated microtubule networks and changes in cellular morphology, as well as impaired trafficking of both HSV-1 and transferrin. These trafficking defects in TACC3-depleted cells were reversed by the depletion of kinesin-1 heavy chains. As such, TACC3 is a critical regulator of interphase microtubule dynamics and stability that influences kinesin-1-based cargo trafficking."	0

"30686592"	"High-Resolution Ribosome Profiling Defines Discrete Ribosome Elongation States and Translational Regulation during Cellular Stress.Ribosomes undergo substantial conformational changes during translation elongation to accommodate incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs and translocate along the mRNA template. We used multiple elongation inhibitors and chemical probing to define ribosome conformational states corresponding to differently sized ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) generated by ribosome profiling. We show, using various genetic and environmental perturbations, that short 20-22 or classical 27-29 nucleotide RPFs correspond to ribosomes with open or occupied ribosomal A sites, respectively. These distinct states of translation elongation are readily discerned by ribosome profiling in all eukaryotes we tested, including fungi, worms, and mammals. This high-resolution ribosome profiling approach reveals mechanisms of translation-elongation arrest during distinct stress conditions. Hyperosmotic stress inhibits translocation through Rck2-dependent eEF2 phosphorylation, whereas oxidative stress traps ribosomes in a pre-translocation state, independent of Rck2-driven eEF2 phosphorylation.

Here, we describe a mechanism of FBXL5 regulation involving its interaction with the cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex composed of MMS19, FAM96B, and CIAO1. We demonstrate that the CIA-targeting complex promotes the ability of FBXL5 to degrade IRPs.

"32302542"	"Genomic Clustering Facilitates Nuclear Processing of Suboptimal Pri-miRNA Loci.Nuclear processing of most miRNAs is mediated by Microprocessor, comprised of RNase III enzyme Drosha and its cofactor DGCR8. Here, we uncover a hidden layer of Microprocessor regulation via studies of Dicer-independent mir-451, which is clustered with canonical mir-144. Although mir-451 is fully dependent on Drosha/DGCR8, its short stem and small terminal loop render it an intrinsically weak Microprocessor substrate. Thus, it must reside within a cluster for normal biogenesis, although the identity and orientation of its neighbor are flexible. We use DGCR8 tethering assays and operon structure-function assays to demonstrate that local recruitment and transfer of Microprocessor enhances suboptimal substrate processing. This principle applies more broadly since genomic analysis indicates suboptimal canonical miRNAs are enriched in operons, and we validate several of these experimentally. Proximity-based enhancement of suboptimal hairpin processing provides a rationale for genomic retention of certain miRNA operons and may explain preferential evolutionary emergence of miRNA operons."	0

Critical to this control is SLX4IP, which accumulates at ALT telomeres and interacts with SLX4, XPF, and BLM. Loss of SLX4IP increases ALT-related phenotypes, which is incompatible with cell growth following concomitant loss of SLX4. Inactivation of BLM is sufficient to rescue telomere aggregation and the synthetic growth defect in this context, suggesting that SLX4IP favors SMX-dependent resolution by antagonizing promiscuous BLM activity during ALT recombination. Finally, we show that SLX4IP is inactivated in a subset of ALT-positive osteosarcomas. Collectively, our findings uncover an SLX4IP-dependent regulatory mechanism critical for telomere maintenance in ALT cancer cells."	0

Here we examine the role of Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Using a combination of imaging and Hi-C analyses, we show that PRC1-mediated long-range interactions are independent of CTCF and can bridge sites at a megabase scale. Impairment of PRC1 enzymatic activity does not directly disrupt these interactions. We demonstrate that PcG targets coalesce in vivo, and that developmentally induced expression of one of the target loci disrupts this spatial arrangement.

However, how the physical interaction between FBXL5 and IRP2 is regulated remains elusive. Here, we show that the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of FBXL5 harbors a [2Fe2S] cluster in the oxidized state. A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the IRP2-FBXL5-SKP1 complex reveals that the cluster organizes the FBXL5 C-terminal loop responsible for recruiting IRP2. Interestingly, IRP2 binding to FBXL5 hinges on the oxidized state of the [2Fe2S] cluster maintained by ambient oxygen, which could explain hypoxia-induced IRP2 stabilization. Steric incompatibility also allows FBXL5 to physically dislodge IRP2 from iron-responsive element RNA to facilitate its turnover.

We observe that IAV synergistically sensitizes lung epithelial cells for PFT-mediated necroptosis in vitro and in murine models of Spn co-infection and secondary infection. Pharmacoelogical induction of oxidative stress without virus sensitizes cells for PFT-mediated necroptosis.

"30849394"	"Global Positioning System: Understanding Long Noncoding RNAs through Subcellular Localization.The localization of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within the cell is the primary determinant of their molecular functions. LncRNAs are often thought of as chromatin-restricted regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure. However, a rich population of cytoplasmic lncRNAs has come to light, with diverse roles including translational regulation, signaling, and respiration. RNA maps of increasing resolution and scope are revealing a subcellular world of highly specific localization patterns and hint at sequence-based address codes specifying lncRNA fates. We propose a new framework for analyzing sequencing-based data, which suggests that numbers of cytoplasmic lncRNA molecules rival those in the nucleus. New techniques promise to create high-resolution, transcriptome-wide maps associated with all organelles of the mammalian cell. Given its intimate link to molecular roles, subcellular localization provides a means of unlocking the mystery of lncRNA functions."	0
"31784359"	"Core Components of the Nuclear Pore Bind Distinct States of Chromatin and Contribute to Polycomb Repression.Interactions between the genome and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) have been implicated in multiple gene regulatory processes, but the underlying logic of these interactions remains poorly defined. Here, we report high-resolution chromatin binding maps of two core components of the NPC, Nup107 and Nup93, in Drosophila cells. Our investigation uncovered differential binding of these NPC subunits, where Nup107 preferentially targets active genes while Nup93 associates primarily with Polycomb-silenced regions. Comparison to Lamin-associated domains (LADs) revealed that NPC binding sites can be found within LADs, demonstrating a linear binding of the genome along the nuclear envelope. Importantly, we identified a functional role of Nup93 in silencing of Polycomb target genes and in spatial folding of Polycomb domains. Our findings lend to a model where different nuclear pores bind different types of chromatin via interactions with specific NPC sub-complexes, and a subset of Polycomb domains is stabilized by interactions with Nup93."	0
"32726633"	"NMDAR-Dependent Emergence of Behavioral Representation in Primary Visual Cortex.Although neocortical sensory areas are generally thought to faithfully represent external stimuli, cortical networks exhibit considerable functional plasticity, allowing them to modify their output to reflect ongoing behavioral demands. We apply longitudinal 2-photon imaging of activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice learning a conditioned eyeblink task to investigate the dynamic representations of task-relevant information. We find that, although all V1 neurons robustly and stably encode visual input, pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons exhibit experience-dependent emergence of accurate behavioral representations during learning. The functional plasticity driving performance-predictive activity requires cell-autonomous expression of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Our findings demonstrate that accurate encoding of behavioral output is not inherent to V1 but develops during learning to support visual task performance."	0
"30902546"	"Gene-Specific H1 Eviction through a Transcriptional Activator→p300→NAP1→H1 Pathway.Linker histone H1 has been correlated with transcriptional inhibition, but the mechanistic basis of the inhibition and its reversal during gene activation has remained enigmatic. We report that H1-compacted chromatin, reconstituted in vitro, blocks transcription by abrogating core histone modifications by p300 but not activator and p300 binding. Transcription from H1-bound chromatin is elicited by the H1 chaperone NAP1, which is recruited in a gene-specific manner through direct interactions with activator-bound p300 that facilitate core histone acetylation (by p300) and concomitant eviction of H1 and H2A-H2B. An analysis in B cells confirms the strong dependency on NAP1-mediated H1 eviction for induction of the silent CD40 gene and further demonstrates that H1 eviction, seeded by activator-p300-NAP1-H1 interactions, is propagated over a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-demarcated region through a distinct mechanism that also involves NAP1. Our results confirm direct transcriptional inhibition by H1 and establish a gene-specific H1 eviction mechanism through an activator→p300→NAP1→H1 pathway."	0
"31995756"	"TAG-1 Multifunctionality Coordinates Neuronal Migration, Axon Guidance, and Fasciculation.Neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance need to be closely coordinated for neural circuit assembly. Spinal motor neurons (MNs) face unique challenges during development because their cell bodies reside within the central nervous system (CNS) and their axons project to various targets in the body periphery. The molecular mechanisms that contain MN somata within the spinal cord while allowing their axons to exit the CNS and navigate to their final destinations remain incompletely understood. We find that the MN cell surface protein TAG-1 anchors MN cell bodies in the spinal cord to prevent their emigration, mediates motor axon fasciculation during CNS exit, and guides motor axons past dorsal root ganglia. TAG-1 executes these varied functions in MN development independently of one another. Our results identify TAG-1 as a key multifunctional regulator of MN wiring that coordinates neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance."	0
"31178355"	"Live-Cell Single RNA Imaging Reveals Bursts of Translational Frameshifting.Ribosomal frameshifting during the translation of RNA is implicated in human disease and viral infection. While previous work has uncovered many details about single RNA frameshifting kinetics in vitro, little is known about how single RNA frameshift in living systems. To confront this problem, we have developed technology to quantify live-cell single RNA translation dynamics in frameshifted open reading frames. Applying this technology to RNA encoding the HIV-1 frameshift sequence reveals a small subset (∼8%) of the translating pool robustly frameshift. Frameshifting RNA are translated at similar rates as non-frameshifting RNA (∼3 aa/s) and can continuously frameshift for more than four rounds of translation. Fits to a bursty model of frameshifting constrain frameshifting kinetic rates and demonstrate how ribosomal traffic jams contribute to the persistence of the frameshifting state. These data provide insight into retroviral frameshifting and could lead to alternative strategies to perturb the process in living cells."	0

Disease-associated mutations have been identified by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. However, aside from mutations in TP53 or the RB1 pathway that are common in HGSOC, the contributions of mutation combinations are unclear. Here, we report CRISPR mutagenesis of 20 putative HGSOC driver genes to identify combinatorial disruptions of genes that transform either ovarian surface epithelium stem cells (OSE-SCs) or non-stem cells (OSE-NSs). Our results support the OSE-SC theory of HGSOC initiation and suggest that most commonly mutated genes in HGSOC have no effect on OSE-SC transformation initiation. Our results indicate that disruption of TP53 and PTEN, combined with RB1 disruption, constitutes a core set of mutations driving efficient transformation in vitro. The combined data may contribute to more accurate modeling of HGSOC development."	0
"30554944"	"RSC-Associated Subnucleosomes Define MNase-Sensitive Promoters in Yeast.The classic view of nucleosome organization at active promoters is that two well-positioned nucleosomes flank a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR). However, this view has been recently disputed by contradictory reports as to whether wider (≳150 bp) NDRs instead contain unstable, micrococcal nuclease-sensitive (""fragile"") nucleosomal particles. To determine the composition of fragile particles, we introduce CUT&RUN.ChIP, in which targeted nuclease cleavage and release is followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that fragile particles represent the occupancy of the RSC (remodeling the structure of chromatin) nucleosome remodeling complex and RSC-bound, partially unwrapped nucleosomal intermediates. We also find that general regulatory factors (GRFs) bind to partially unwrapped nucleosomes at these promoters. We propose that RSC binding and its action cause nucleosomes to unravel, facilitate subsequent binding of GRFs, and constitute a dynamic cycle of nucleosome deposition and clearance at the subset of wide Pol II promoter NDRs."	0
"32513871"	"CRISPR type II-A subgroups exhibit phylogenetically distinct mechanisms for prespacer insertion.CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes against foreign nucleic acids. Prokaryotes gain immunity by acquiring short pieces of the invading nucleic acid termed prespacers and inserting them into their CRISPR array. In type II-A systems, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins insert prespacers always at the leader-repeat junction of the CRISPR array. Among type II-A CRISPR systems, three distinct groups (G1, G2, and G3) exist according to the extent of DNA sequence conservation at the 3' end of the leader. However, the mechanisms by which these conserved motifs interact with their cognate Cas1 and Cas2 proteins remain unclear. Here, we performed <i>in vitro</i> integration assays, finding that for G1 and G2, the insertion site is recognized through defined mechanisms, at least in members examined to date, whereas G3 exhibits no sequence-specific insertion. G1 first recognized a 12-bp sequence at the leader-repeat junction and performed leader-side insertion before proceeding to spacer-side insertion. G2 recognized the full repeat sequence and could perform independent leader-side or spacer-side insertions, although the leader-side insertion was faster than spacer-side. The prespacer morphology requirements for Cas1-Cas2 varied, with G1 stringently requiring a 5-nucleotide 3' overhang and G2 being able to insert many forms of prespacers with variable efficiencies. These results highlight the intricacy of protein-DNA sequence interactions within the seemingly similar type II-A integration complexes and provide mechanistic insights into prespacer insertion. These interactions can be fine-tuned to expand the Cas1-Cas2 toolset for inserting small DNAs into diverse DNA targets."	0
"32075773"	"Chaperone-Facilitated Aggregation of Thermo-Sensitive Proteins Shields Them from Degradation during Heat Stress.Cells have developed protein quality-control strategies to manage the accumulation of misfolded substrates during heat stress. Using a soluble reporter of misfolding in fission yeast, Rho1.C17R-GFP, we demonstrate that upon mild heat shock, the reporter collapses in protein aggregate centers (PACs). They contain and/or require several chaperones, such as Hsp104, Hsp16, and the Hsp40/70 couple Mas5/Ssa2. Stress granules do not assemble at mild temperatures and, therefore, are not required for PAC formation; on the contrary, PACs may serve as nucleation centers for the assembly of stress granules. In contrast to the general belief, the dominant fate of these PACs is not degradation, and the aggregated reporter can be disassembled by chaperones and recovers native structure and activity. Using mass spectrometry, we show that thermo-unstable endogenous proteins form PACs as well. In conclusion, formation of PACs during heat shock is a chaperone-mediated adaptation strategy."	0
"32553162"	"Differential Cellular Response to Translocated Toxic Effectors and Physical Penetration by the Type VI Secretion System.The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal microbial weapon that injects a large needle-like structure carrying toxic effectors into recipient cells through physical penetration. How recipients respond to physical force and effectors remains elusive. Here, we use a series of effector mutants of Vibrio cholerae to determine how T6SS elicits response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. We show that TseL, but no other effectors or physical puncture, triggers the tit-for-tat response of P. aeruginosa H1-T6SS. Although E. coli is sensitive to all periplasmically expressed effectors, P. aeruginosa is most sensitive to TseL alone. We identify a number of stress response pathways that confer protection against TseL. Physical puncture of T6SS has a moderate inhibitory effect only on envelope-impaired tolB and rseA mutants. Our data reveal that recipient cells primarily respond to effector toxicity but not to physical contact, and they rely on the stress response for immunity-independent protection."	0
"32160535"	"The Synaptic Vesicle Priming Protein CAPS-1 Shapes the Adaptation of Sensory Evoked Responses in Mouse Visual Cortex.Short-term plasticity gates information transfer across neuronal synapses and is thought to be involved in fundamental brain processes, such as cortical gain control and sensory adaptation. Neurons employ synaptic vesicle priming proteins of the CAPS and Munc13 families to shape short-term plasticity in vitro, but the relevance of this phenomenon for information processing in the intact brain is unknown. By combining sensory stimulation with in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice, we show that genetic deletion of CAPS-1 in thalamic neurons results in more rapid adaptation of sensory-evoked subthreshold responses in layer 4 neurons of the primary visual cortex. Optogenetic experiments in acute brain slices further reveal that the enhanced adaptation is caused by more pronounced short-term synaptic depression. Our data indicate that neurons engage CAPS-family priming proteins to shape short-term plasticity for optimal sensory information transfer between thalamic and cortical neurons in the intact brain in vivo."	0
"32482893"	"A-kinase-anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1)-based signaling complexes coordinate local protein synthesis at the mitochondrial surface.Compartmentalization of macromolecules is a ubiquitous molecular mechanism that drives numerous cellular functions. The appropriate organization of enzymes in space and time enables the precise transmission and integration of intracellular signals. Molecular scaffolds constrain signaling enzymes to influence the regional modulation of these physiological processes. Mitochondrial targeting of protein kinases and protein phosphatases provides a means to locally control the phosphorylation status and action of proteins on the surface of this organelle. Dual-specificity protein kinase A anchoring protein 1 (dAKAP1) is a multivalent binding protein that targets protein kinase A (PKA), RNAs, and other signaling enzymes to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Many AKAPs recruit a diverse set of binding partners that coordinate a broad range of cellular processes. Here, results of MS and biochemical analyses reveal that dAKAP1 anchors additional components, including the ribonucleoprotein granule components La-related protein 4 (LARP4) and polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1). Local translation of mRNAs at organelles is a means to spatially control the synthesis of proteins. RNA-Seq data demonstrate that dAKAP1 binds mRNAs encoding proteins required for mitochondrial metabolism, including succinate dehydrogenase. Functional studies suggest that the loss of dAKAP1-RNA interactions reduces mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. Hence, dAKAP1 plays a previously unappreciated role as a molecular interface between second messenger signaling and local protein synthesis machinery."	1
"31968240"	"Follicular Regulatory T Cells Can Access the Germinal Center Independently of CXCR5.The germinal center (GC) response is critical for generating high-affinity humoral immunity and immunological memory, which forms the basis of successful immunization. Control of the GC response is thought to require follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells, a subset of suppressive Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells located within GCs. Relatively little is known about the exact role of Tfr cells within the GC and how they exert their suppressive function. A unique feature of Tfr cells is their reported CXCR5-dependent localization to the GC. Here, we show that the lack of CXCR5 on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells results in a reduced frequency, but not an absence, of GC-localized Tfr cells. This reduction in Tfr cells is not sufficient to alter the magnitude or output of the GC response. This demonstrates that additional, CXCR5-independent mechanisms facilitate Treg cell homing to the GC."	0
"32348771"	"Intricate Genetic Programs Controlling Dormancy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) displays the remarkable ability to transition in and out of dormancy, a hallmark of the pathogen's capacity to evade the immune system and exploit susceptible individuals. Uncovering the gene regulatory programs that underlie the phenotypic shifts in MTB during disease latency and reactivation has posed a challenge. We develop an experimental system to precisely control dissolved oxygen levels in MTB cultures in order to capture the transcriptional events that unfold as MTB transitions into and out of hypoxia-induced dormancy. Using a comprehensive genome-wide transcription factor binding map and insights from network topology analysis, we identify regulatory circuits that deterministically drive sequential transitions across six transcriptionally and functionally distinct states encompassing more than three-fifths of the MTB genome. The architecture of the genetic programs explains the transcriptional dynamics underlying synchronous entry of cells into a dormant state that is primed to infect the host upon encountering favorable conditions."	0
"32877676"	"Distinct Signaling by Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamate, GABA, and Combinatorial Glutamate-GABA Neurons in Motivated Behavior.Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons play roles in reward and aversion. We recently discovered that the VTA has neurons that co-transmit glutamate and GABA (glutamate-GABA co-transmitting neurons), transmit glutamate without GABA (glutamate-transmitting neurons), or transmit GABA without glutamate (GABA-transmitting neurons). However, the functions of these VTA cell types in motivated behavior are unclear. To identify the functions of these VTA cell types, we combine recombinase mouse lines with INTRSECT2.0 vectors to selectively target these neurons. We find that VTA cell types have unique signaling patterns for reward, aversion, and learned cues. Whereas VTA glutamate-transmitting neurons signal cues predicting reward, VTA GABA-transmitting neurons signal cues predicting the absence of reward, and glutamate-GABA co-transmitting neurons signal rewarding and aversive outcomes without signaling learned cues related to those outcomes. Thus, we demonstrate that genetically defined subclasses of VTA glutamate and GABA neurons signal different aspects of motivated behavior."	0

Structures of these antibodies indicate diverse modes of Env recognition typified by antibodies of the PG9 class and the PGT145 class. The mode of recognition, however, has been unclear for the most potent of the V1V2 apex-targeting antibodies, CAP256-VRC26.25 (named for donor-lineage.clone and referred to hereafter as VRC26.25). Here, we determine the cryoelectron microscopy structure at 3.7 Å resolution of the antigen-binding fragment of VRC26.25 in complex with the Env trimer thought to have initiated the lineage. The 36-residue protruding loop of VRC26.25 displays recognition incorporating both strand-C interactions similar to the PG9 class and V1V2 apex insertion similar to the PGT145 class. Structural elements of separate antibody classes can thus intermingle to form a ""combined"" class, which in this case yields an antibody of extraordinary potency."	0

While influence of the CBC can extend into the cytoplasm, here we review the roles of the CBC in the nucleus, with a focus on protein-coding genes. We discuss differences between CBC function in yeast and mammals, covering the steps of transcription initiation, release of RNAPII from pausing, transcription elongation, cotranscriptional pre-mRNA splicing, transcription termination, and consequences of spurious transcription. We describe parameters known to control the binding of generic or gene-specific cofactors that regulate CBC activities depending on the process(es) targeted, illustrating how the CBC is an ever-changing choreographer of gene expression."	0

Here, we report an unanticipated cell-death- and inflammation-independent function of RIPK1 and Caspase-8, promoting faithful chromosome alignment in mitosis and thereby ensuring genome stability. We find that ripoptosome complexes progressively form as cells enter mitosis, peaking at metaphase and disassembling as cells exit mitosis. Genetic deletion and mitosis-specific inhibition of Ripk1 or Caspase-8 results in chromosome alignment defects independently of MLKL. We found that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited into mitotic ripoptosomes, where PLK1's activity is controlled via RIPK1-dependent recruitment and Caspase-8-mediated cleavage. A fine balance of ripoptosome assembly is required as deregulated ripoptosome activity modulates PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as BUBR1. Our data suggest that ripoptosome-mediated regulation of PLK1 contributes to faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis."	1
"32492424"	"Critical Roles of Translation Initiation and RNA Uridylation in Endogenous Retroviral Expression and Neural Differentiation in Pluripotent Stem Cells.Previous studies have suggested that the loss of the translation initiation factor eIF4G1 homolog NAT1 induces excessive self-renewability of naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs); yet the role of NAT1 in the self-renewal and differentiation of primed PSCs is still unclear. Here, we generate a conditional knockout of NAT1 in primed PSCs and use the cells for the functional analyses of NAT1. Our results show that NAT1 is required for the self-renewal and neural differentiation of primed PSCs. In contrast, NAT1 deficiency in naive pluripotency attenuates the differentiation to all cell types. We also find that NAT1 is involved in efficient protein expression of an RNA uridyltransferase, TUT7. TUT7 is involved in the neural differentiation of primed PSCs via the regulation of human endogenous retrovirus accumulation. These data demonstrate the essential roles of NAT1 and TUT7 in the precise transition of stem cell fate."	1
"32521276"	"Unique and Shared Roles for Histone H3K36 Methylation States in Transcription Regulation Functions.Set2 co-transcriptionally methylates lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36), producing mono-, di-, and trimethylation (H3K36me1/2/3). These modifications recruit or repel chromatin effector proteins important for transcriptional fidelity, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair. However, it was not known whether the different methylation states of H3K36 have distinct biological functions. Here, we use engineered forms of Set2 that produce different lysine methylation states to identify unique and shared functions for H3K36 modifications. Although H3K36me1/2 and H3K36me3 are functionally redundant in many SET2 deletion phenotypes, we found that H3K36me3 has a unique function related to Bur1 kinase activity and FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex function. Further, during nutrient stress, either H3K36me1/2 or H3K36me3 represses high levels of histone acetylation and cryptic transcription that arises from within genes. Our findings uncover the potential for the regulation of diverse chromatin functions by different H3K36 methylation states."	0
"31353207"	"C1QBP Promotes Homologous Recombination by Stabilizing MRE11 and Controlling the Assembly and Activation of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 Complex.MRE11 nuclease forms a trimeric complex (MRN) with RAD50 and NBS1 and plays a central role in preventing genomic instability. When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MRN is quickly recruited to the damage site and initiates DNA end resection; accordingly, MRE11 must be tightly regulated to avoid inefficient repair or nonspecific resection. Here, we show that MRE11 and RAD50 form a complex (MRC) with C1QBP, which stabilizes MRE11/RAD50, while inhibiting MRE11 nuclease activity by preventing its binding to DNA or chromatin. Upon DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates MRE11-S676/S678 to quickly dissociate the MRC complex. Either excess or insufficient C1QBP impedes the recruitment of MRE11 to DSBs and impairs the DNA damage response. C1QBP is highly expressed in breast cancer and positively correlates with MRE11 expression, and the inhibition of C1QBP enhances tumor regression with chemotherapy. By influencing MRE11 at multiple levels, C1QBP is, thus, an important player in the DNA damage response."	0
"31995754"	"Critical Role of Lipid Scramblase TMEM16F in Phosphatidylserine Exposure and Repair of Plasma Membrane after Pore Formation.Plasma membrane damage and cell death during processes such as necroptosis and apoptosis result from cues originating intracellularly. However, death caused by pore-forming agents, like bacterial toxins or complement, is due to direct external injury to the plasma membrane. To prevent death, the plasma membrane has an intrinsic repair ability. Here, we found that repair triggered by pore-forming agents involved TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase also mutated in Scott's syndrome. Upon pore formation and the subsequent influx of intracellular calcium, TMEM16F induced rapid ""lipid scrambling"" in the plasma membrane. This response was accompanied by membrane blebbing, extracellular vesicle release, preserved membrane integrity, and increased cell viability. TMEM16F-deficient mice exhibited compromised control of infection by Listeria monocytogenes associated with a greater sensitivity of neutrophils to the pore-forming Listeria toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). Thus, the lipid scramblase TMEM16F is critical for plasma membrane repair after injury by pore-forming agents."	0

"30765194"	"The C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II Is a Multivalent Targeting Sequence that Supports Drosophila Development with Only Consensus Heptads.The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is composed of repeats of the consensus YSPTSPS and is an essential binding scaffold for transcription-associated factors. Metazoan CTDs have well-conserved lengths and sequence compositions arising from the evolution of divergent motifs, features thought to be essential for development. On the contrary, we show that a truncated CTD composed solely of YSPTSPS repeats supports Drosophila viability but that a CTD with enough YSPTSPS repeats to match the length of the wild-type Drosophila CTD is defective. Furthermore, a fluorescently tagged CTD lacking the rest of Pol II dynamically enters transcription compartments, indicating that the CTD functions as a signal sequence. However, CTDs with too many YSPTSPS repeats are more prone to localize to static nuclear foci separate from the chromosomes. We propose that the sequence complexity of the CTD offsets aberrant behavior caused by excessive repetitive sequences without compromising its targeting function."	0

In some cases, the intracellular environment has an impact on the mechanism, which might be missed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments. IR difference spectroscopy previously has been applied to study the light-induced response of photoreceptors and photoenzymes <i>in vitro</i> Here, we established the in-cell IR difference (ICIRD) spectroscopy in the transmission and attenuated total reflection configuration to investigate the light-induced response of soluble proteins in living bacterial cells. ICIRD spectroscopy on the light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains of the blue light receptors aureochrome and phototropin revealed a suppression of the response of specific secondary structure elements, indicating that the intracellular environment affects LOV photoreceptor mechanisms in general. Moreover, in-cell fluorescence spectroscopy disclosed that the intracellular environment slows down the recovery of the light-induced flavin adduct. Segment-resolved ICIRD spectroscopy on basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP)-LOV of aureochrome 1a from the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> indicated a signal progression from the LOV sensor to the bZIP effector independent of unfolding of the connecting A'α-helix, an observation that stood in contrast to <i>in vitro</i> results. This deviation was recapitulated <i>in vitro</i> by emulating the intracellular environment through the addition of the crowding agent BSA, but not by sucrose polymers. We conclude that ICIRD spectroscopy is a noninvasive, label-free approach for assessing conformational changes in receptors in living cells at ambient conditions. As demonstrated, these near-native responses may deviate from the mechanisms established under <i>in vitro</i> conditions."	0

To understand this mechanism, we utilize human Jurkat cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our results show that inhibition of HIV-1 infection caused by disrupting CypA-capsid interactions is dependent on human tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub>), showing that TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> restricts HIV-1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, depletion of TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rescues HIV-1 that fail to interact with CypA, such as HIV-1-P90A. We found that TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> binds to the HIV-1 core. Disruption of CypA-capsid interactions fail to affect HIV-1-A92E/G94D infection, correlating with the loss of TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> binding to HIV-1-A92E/G94D cores. Disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in primary cells has a greater inhibitory effect on HIV-1 when compared to Jurkat cells. Consistent with TRIM5α restriction, disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells inhibits reverse transcription. Overall, our results reveal that CypA binding to the core protects HIV-1 from TRIM5α<sub>hu</sub> restriction."	0

However, there is no consensus on how malaria impacts EBOV infection. The effect of acute Plasmodium infection on EBOV challenge was investigated using mouse-adapted EBOV and a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) model virus. We demonstrate that acute Plasmodium infection protects from lethal viral challenge, dependent upon interferon gamma (IFN-γ) elicited as a result of parasite infection. Plasmodium-infected mice lacking the IFN-γ receptor are not protected. Ex vivo incubation of naive human or mouse macrophages with sera from acutely parasitemic rodents or macaques programs a proinflammatory phenotype dependent on IFN-γ and renders cells resistant to EBOV infection. We conclude that acute Plasmodium infection can safeguard against EBOV by the production of protective IFN-γ. These findings have implications for anti-malaria therapies administered during episodic EBOV outbreaks in Africa."	0
"31836388"	"Paradoxical Role for Wild-Type p53 in Driving Therapy Resistance in Melanoma.Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease, despite recent improvements in therapy. Eradicating all melanoma cells even in drug-sensitive tumors is unsuccessful in patients because a subset of cells can transition to a slow-cycling state, rendering them resistant to most targeted therapy. It is still unclear what pathways define these subpopulations and promote this resistant phenotype. In the current study, we show that Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that drives a metastatic, therapy-resistant phenotype, stabilizes the half-life of p53 and uses p53 to initiate a slow-cycling state following stress (DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging). Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow-cycling phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibition. In vivo, this can be accomplished with a single dose of p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating wild-type p53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy."	0
"32726618"	"Analysis of Local Chromatin States Reveals Gene Transcription Potential during Mouse Neural Progenitor Cell Differentiation.Chromatin dynamics play a critical role in cell fate determination and maintenance by regulating the expression of genes essential for development and differentiation. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), maintenance of pluripotency coincides with a poised chromatin state containing active and repressive histone modifications. However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions. Use of COPI provides effective prediction of gene activation potential and, more importantly, reveals a few developmental factors essential for mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation."	0
"32433970"	"Circadian Clock Regulation of Developmental Time in the Kidney.We report the emergence of an endogenous circadian clock that regulates organogenesis in mouse fetal kidney. We detect circadian rhythms both in vivo with transcriptional profiling and ex vivo by bioluminescence. High-resolution structural analysis of embryonic explants reveals that global or local clock disruption results in defects that resemble human congenital abnormalities of the kidney. The onset of fetal rhythms strongly correlates with the timing of a distinct transition in branching and growth rates during a gestational window of high fetal growth demands. Defects in clock mutants typically have been attributed to accelerated aging; however, our study establishes a role for the fetal circadian clock as a developmental timer that regulates the pathways that control organogenesis, branching rate, and nephron number and thus plays a fundamental role in kidney development."	0

Dysregulation of these biomolecular interactions or malfunction of the associated enzymes results in various diseases; therefore, these interactions and enzymes are attractive targets for therapies. High-throughput screening can greatly facilitate the discovery of drugs for these targets. Here, we describe a biomolecular interaction detection method, called phase-separated <u>c</u>ondensate-aided <u>e</u>nrichment of <u>b</u>iomolecular <u>i</u>nteractions in <u>t</u>est tubes (CEBIT). The readout of CEBIT is the selective recruitment of biomolecules into phase-separated condensates harboring their cognate binding partners. We tailored CEBIT to detect various biomolecular interactions and activities of biomolecule-modifying enzymes. Using CEBIT-based high-throughput screening assays, we identified known inhibitors of the p53/MDM2 (MDM2) interaction and of the histone methyltransferase, suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), from a compound library. CEBIT is simple and versatile, and is likely to become a powerful tool for drug discovery and basic biomedical research."	0
"32075765"	"Propionic Acid Promotes the Virulent Phenotype of Crohn's Disease-Associated Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli.Propionic acid (PA) is a bacterium-derived intestinal antimicrobial and immune modulator used widely in food production and agriculture. Passage of Crohn's disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) through a murine model, in which intestinal PA levels are increased to mimic the human intestine, leads to the recovery of AIEC with significantly increased virulence. Similar phenotypic changes are observed outside the murine model when AIEC is grown in culture with PA as the sole carbon source; such PA exposure also results in AIEC that persists at 20-fold higher levels in vivo. RNA sequencing identifies an upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress response, metabolism, membrane integrity, and alternative carbon source utilization. PA exposure also increases virulence in a number of E. coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients. Removal of PA is sufficient to reverse these phenotypic changes. Our data indicate that exposure to PA results in AIEC resistance and increased virulence in its presence."	0
"32402281"	"Relocation of Collapsed Forks to the Nuclear Pore Complex Depends on Sumoylation of DNA Repair Proteins and Permits Rad51 Association.Expanded CAG repeats form stem-loop secondary structures that lead to fork stalling and collapse. Previous work has shown that these collapsed forks relocalize to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in late S phase in a manner dependent on replication, the nucleoporin Nup84, and the Slx5 protein, which prevents repeat fragility and instability. Here, we show that binding of the Smc5/6 complex to the collapsed fork triggers Mms21-dependent sumoylation of fork-associated DNA repair proteins, and that RPA, Rad52, and Rad59 are the key sumoylation targets that mediate relocation. The SUMO interacting motifs of Slx5 target collapsed forks to the NPC. Notably, Rad51 foci only co-localize with the repeat after it is anchored to the nuclear periphery and Rad51 exclusion from the early collapsed fork is dependent on RPA sumoylation. This pathway may provide a mechanism to constrain recombination at stalled or collapsed forks until it is required for fork restart."	0

UB-like structures generated from human pluripotent stem cells by previously reported methods show limited developmental ability and limited branching. Here we report a method to generate UB organoids that possess epithelial polarity and tubular lumen and repeat branching morphogenesis. We also succeed in monitoring UB tip cells by utilizing the ability of tip cells to uptake very-low-density lipoprotein, cryopreserving UB progenitor cells, and expanding UB tip cells that can reconstitute the organoids and differentiate into collecting duct progenitors. Moreover, we successfully reproduce some phenotypes of multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) using the UB organoids. These methods will help elucidate the developmental mechanisms of UB branching and develop a selective differentiation method for collecting duct cells, contributing to the creation of disease models for congenital renal abnormalities."	0
"32027840"	"Replicational Dilution of H3K27me3 in Mammalian Cells and the Role of Poised Promoters.Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) places H3K27me3 at developmental genes and is causally implicated in keeping bivalent genes silent. It is unclear if that silence requires minimum H3K27me3 levels and how the mark transmits faithfully across mammalian somatic cell generations. Mouse intestinal cells lacking EZH2 methyltransferase reduce H3K27me3 proportionately at all PRC2 target sites, but ∼40% uniform residual levels keep target genes inactive. These genes, derepressed in PRC2-null villus cells, remain silent in intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and computational modeling indicate that because unmodified histones dilute H3K27me3 by 50% each time DNA replicates, PRC2-deficient ISCs initially retain sufficient H3K27me3 to avoid gene derepression. EZH2 mutant human lymphoma cells also require multiple divisions before H3K27me3 dilution relieves gene silencing. In both cell types, promoters with high basal H3K4me2/3 activate in spite of some residual H3K27me3, compared to less-poised promoters. These findings have implications for PRC2 inhibition in cancer therapy."	0

"32579914"	"NeuroD1 Dictates Tumor Cell Differentiation in Medulloblastoma.Tumor cells are characterized by unlimited proliferation and perturbed differentiation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that tumor cells in medulloblastoma (MB) retain their capacity to differentiate in a similar way as their normal originating cells, cerebellar granule neuron precursors. Once they differentiate, MB cells permanently lose their proliferative capacity and tumorigenic potential. Differentiated MB cells highly express NeuroD1, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and forced expression of NeuroD1 promotes the differentiation of MB cells. The expression of NeuroD1 in bulk MB cells is repressed by trimethylation of histone 3 lysine-27 (H3K27me3). Inhibition of the histone lysine methyltransferase EZH2 prevents H3K27 trimethylation, resulting in increased NeuroD1 expression and enhanced differentiation in MB cells, which consequently reduces tumor growth. These studies reveal the mechanisms underlying MB cell differentiation and provide rationales to treat MB (potentially other malignancies) by stimulating tumor cell differentiation."	1
"31733992"	"An mTORC1-to-CDK1 Switch Maintains Autophagy Suppression during Mitosis.Since nuclear envelope breakdown occurs during mitosis in metazoan cells, it has been proposed that macroautophagy must be inhibited to maintain genome integrity. However, repression of macroautophagy during mitosis remains controversial and mechanistic detail limited to the suggestion that CDK1 phosphorylates VPS34. Here, we show that initiation of macroautophagy, measured by the translocation of the ULK complex to autophagic puncta, is repressed during mitosis, even when mTORC1 is inhibited. Indeed, mTORC1 is inactive during mitosis, reflecting its failure to localize to lysosomes due to CDK1-dependent RAPTOR phosphorylation. While mTORC1 normally represses autophagy via phosphorylation of ULK1, ATG13, ATG14, and TFEB, we show that the mitotic phosphorylation of these autophagy regulators, including at known repressive sites, is dependent on CDK1 but independent of mTOR. Thus, CDK1 substitutes for inhibited mTORC1 as the master regulator of macroautophagy during mitosis, uncoupling autophagy regulation from nutrient status to ensure repression of macroautophagy during mitosis."	1

"31919189"	"Upon microbial challenge, human neutrophils undergo rapid changes in nuclear architecture and chromatin folding to orchestrate an immediate inflammatory gene program.Differentiating neutrophils undergo large-scale changes in nuclear morphology. How such alterations in structure are established and modulated upon exposure to microbial agents is largely unknown. Here, we found that prior to encounter with bacteria, an armamentarium of inflammatory genes was positioned in a transcriptionally passive environment suppressing premature transcriptional activation. Upon microbial exposure, however, human neutrophils rapidly (<3 h) repositioned the ensemble of proinflammatory genes toward the transcriptionally permissive compartment. We show that the repositioning of genes was closely associated with the swift recruitment of cohesin across the inflammatory enhancer landscape, permitting an immediate transcriptional response upon bacterial exposure. We found that activated enhancers, marked by increased deposition of H3K27Ac, were highly enriched for cistromic elements associated with PU.1, CEBPB, TFE3, JUN, and FOSL2 occupancy. These data reveal how upon microbial challenge the cohesin machinery is recruited to an activated enhancer repertoire to instruct changes in chromatin folding, nuclear architecture, and to activate an inflammatory gene program."	0
"32273287"	"REDD1 loss reprograms lipid metabolism to drive progression of <i>RAS</i> mutant tumors.Human cancers with activating <i>RAS</i> mutations are typically highly aggressive and treatment-refractory, yet <i>RAS</i> mutation itself is insufficient for tumorigenesis, due in part to profound metabolic stress induced by RAS activation. Here we show that loss of REDD1, a stress-induced metabolic regulator, is sufficient to reprogram lipid metabolism and drive progression of <i>RAS</i> mutant cancers. <i>Redd1</i> deletion in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of KRAS-dependent pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas converts preneoplastic lesions into invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Metabolic profiling reveals that REDD1-deficient/<i>RAS</i> mutant cells exhibit enhanced uptake of lysophospholipids and lipid storage, coupled to augmented fatty acid oxidation that sustains both ATP levels and ROS-detoxifying NADPH. Mechanistically, REDD1 loss triggers HIF-dependent activation of a lipid storage pathway involving PPARγ and the prometastatic factor CD36. Correspondingly, decreased REDD1 expression and a signature of REDD1 loss predict poor outcomes selectively in <i>RAS</i> mutant but not <i>RAS</i> wild-type human lung and pancreas carcinomas. Collectively, our findings reveal the REDD1-mediated stress response as a novel tumor suppressor whose loss defines a <i>RAS</i> mutant tumor subset characterized by reprogramming of lipid metabolism, invasive and metastatic progression, and poor prognosis. This work thus provides new mechanistic and clinically relevant insights into the phenotypic heterogeneity and metabolic rewiring that underlies these common cancers."	0

The mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation and its contribution to SDH-deficient cancers remain undemonstrated. We examine the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and their correlation with RNA expression in SDHB-deficient tumors and murine Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup> cells. We report that DNA hypermethylation results from TET inhibition. Although it preferentially affects PRC2 targets and known developmental genes, PRC2 activity does not contribute to the DNA hypermethylator phenotype. We also prove, in vitro and in vivo, that TET silencing, although recapitulating the methylation profile of Sdhb<sup>-/-</sup> cells, is not sufficient to drive their EMT-like phenotype, which requires additional HIF2α activation. Altogether, our findings reveal synergistic roles of TET repression and pseudohypoxia in the acquisition of metastatic traits, providing a rationale for targeting HIF2α and DNA methylation in SDH-associated malignancies."	0
"32035037"	"Cohesin Removal Reprograms Gene Expression upon Mitotic Entry.As cells enter mitosis, the genome is restructured to facilitate chromosome segregation, accompanied by dramatic changes in gene expression. However, the mechanisms that underlie mitotic transcriptional regulation are unclear. In contrast to transcribed genes, centromere regions retain transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in mitosis. Here, we demonstrate that chromatin-bound cohesin is necessary to retain elongating Pol II at centromeres. We find that WAPL-mediated removal of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase is required for the dissociation of Pol II and nascent transcripts, and failure of this process dramatically alters mitotic gene expression. Removal of cohesin/Pol II from chromosome arms in prophase is important for accurate chromosome segregation and normal activation of gene expression in G1. We propose that prophase cohesin removal is a key step in reprogramming gene expression as cells transition from G2 through mitosis to G1."	0
"32209466"	"An mRNA-mRNA Interaction Couples Expression of a Virulence Factor and Its Chaperone in Listeria monocytogenes.Bacterial pathogens often employ RNA regulatory elements located in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) to control gene expression. Using a comparative structural analysis, we examine the structure of 5' UTRs at a global scale in the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes under different conditions. In addition to discovering an RNA thermoswitch and detecting simultaneous interaction of ribosomes and small RNAs with mRNA, we identify structural changes in the 5' UTR of an mRNA encoding the post-translocation chaperone PrsA2 during infection conditions. We demonstrate that the 5' UTR of the prsA2 mRNA base pairs with the 3' UTR of the full-length hly mRNA encoding listeriolysin O, thus preventing RNase J1-mediated degradation of the prsA2 transcript. Mutants lacking the hly-prsA2 interaction exhibit reduced virulence properties.

"31400850"	"RAD51AP1 Is an Essential Mediator of Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres.Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism of telomere elongation that controls proliferation in aggressive cancers. We show that the disruption of RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) in ALT+ cancer cells leads to generational telomere shortening. This is due to RAD51AP1's involvement in RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) and RAD52-POLD3-dependent break induced DNA synthesis. RAD51AP1 KO ALT+ cells exhibit telomere dysfunction and cytosolic telomeric DNA fragments that are sensed by cGAS. Intriguingly, they activate ULK1-ATG7-dependent autophagy as a survival mechanism to mitigate DNA damage and apoptosis. Importantly, RAD51AP1 protein levels are elevated in ALT+ cells due to MMS21 associated SUMOylation. Mutation of a single SUMO-targeted lysine residue perturbs telomere dynamics. These findings indicate that RAD51AP1 is an essential mediator of the ALT mechanism and is co-opted by post-translational mechanisms to maintain telomere length and ensure proliferation of ALT+ cancer cells."	0

Here we describe a transcriptional regulator that preserves the stemness of ISCs by restricting their differentiation into secretory-cell lineages. Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) negatively regulates interferon signalling<sup>3</sup>, and mice completely lacking Irf2<sup>4</sup> or with a selective Irf2 deletion in their intestinal epithelial cells have significantly fewer crypt Lgr5<sup>hi</sup> ISCs than control mice. Although the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells was unimpaired at steady state in Irf2-deficient mice, regeneration of their intestinal epithelia after 5-fluorouracil-induced damage was severely impaired. Similarly, extended treatment with low-dose poly(I:C) or chronic infection of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 (LCMV C13)<sup>5</sup> caused a functional decline of ISCs in wild-type mice. In contrast, massive accumulations of immature Paneth cells were found at the crypt base of Irf2<sup>-/-</sup> as well as LCMV C13-infected wild-type mice, indicating that excess interferon signalling directs ISCs towards a secretory-cell fate.

DBP is highly localized to the liver and pancreatic α cells. Although DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms, and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates α cell morphology, α cell function, and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP leads to smaller and hyperplastic α cells, altered Na<sup>+</sup> channel conductance, impaired α cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, this involves reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution.

"32294443"	"Blood Flow Limits Endothelial Cell Extrusion in the Zebrafish Dorsal Aorta.Blood flow modulates endothelial cell (EC) response during angiogenesis. Shear stress is known to control gene expression related to the endothelial-mesenchymal transition and endothelial-hematopoietic transition. However, the impact of blood flow on the cellular processes associated with EC extrusion is less well understood. To address this question, we dynamically record EC movements and use 3D quantitative methods to segregate the contributions of various cellular processes to the cellular trajectories in the zebrafish dorsal aorta. We find that ECs spread toward the cell extrusion area following the tissue deformation direction dictated by flow-derived mechanical forces. Cell extrusion increases when blood flow is impaired. Similarly, the mechanosensor polycystic kidney disease 2 (pkd2) limits cell extrusion, suggesting that ECs actively sense mechanical forces in the process. These findings identify pkd2 and flow as critical regulators of EC extrusion and suggest that mechanical forces coordinate this process by maintaining ECs within the endothelium."	0

The interaction of PI3KC3 complex II and its ubiquitously expressed inhibitor, Rubicon, was mapped to the first β sheet of the BECN1 BARA domain and the UVRAG BARA2 domain by hydrogen-deuterium exchange and cryo-EM. These data suggest that the BARA β sheet 1 unfolds to directly engage the membrane. This mechanism was confirmed using protein engineering, giant unilamellar vesicle assays, and molecular simulations. Using this mechanism, a BECN1 β sheet-1 derived peptide activates both PI3KC3 complexes I and II, while HIV-1 Nef inhibits complex II. These data reveal how BECN1 switches on and off PI3KC3 binding to membranes.

"32610135"	"Zeb2 Is a Regulator of Astrogliosis and Functional Recovery after CNS Injury.The astrocytic response to injury is characterized on the cellular level, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the cellular processes is incomplete. The astrocytic response to injury is similar to wound-healing responses in non-neural tissues that involve epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) and upregulation in ZEB transcription factors. Here we show that injury-induced astrogliosis increases EMT-related genes expression, including Zeb2, and long non-coding RNAs, including Zeb2os, which facilitates ZEB2 protein translation. In mouse models of either contusive spinal cord injury or transient ischemic stroke, the conditional knockout of Zeb2 in astrocytes attenuates astrogliosis, generates larger lesions, and delays the recovery of motor function. These findings reveal ZEB2 as an important regulator of the astrocytic response to injury and suggest that astrogliosis is an EMT-like process, which provides a conceptual connection for the molecular and cellular similarities between astrogliosis and wound-healing responses in non-neural tissue."	0

Proper activity of cortical GABAergic interneurons is essential for normal circuit function. We find that nerve injury increases excitability of layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the prelimbic (PL) region of the mPFC from male, but not female, mice. Conversely, nerve injury dampens excitability in somatostatin-expressing neurons in layer 2/3 of the PL region; however, effects are differential between males and females. Nerve injury slightly increases the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing neurons in males but reduces frequency of sEPSCs in layer 2/3 somatostatin-expressing neurons in females.

We previously demonstrated that the gene <i>Kinesin driver</i> (<i>Kindr</i>) on Ab10 encodes a kinesin-14 required to mobilize neocentromeres made up of the major tandem repeat knob180. Here we describe a second kinesin-14 gene, <i>TR-1 kinesin</i> (<i>Trkin</i>), that is required to mobilize neocentromeres made up of the minor tandem repeat TR-1<i>. Trkin</i> lies in a 4-Mb region of Ab10 that is not syntenic with any other region of the maize genome and shows extraordinary sequence divergence from <i>Kindr</i> and other kinesins in plants. Despite its unusual structure, <i>Trkin</i> encodes a functional minus end-directed kinesin that specifically colocalizes with TR-1 in meiosis, forming long drawn out neocentromeres. TRKIN contains a nuclear localization signal and localizes to knobs earlier in prophase than KINDR.

During p97-mediated extraction, the substrate is largely deubiquitinated as it is threaded through the p97 central pore. How p97-extracted substrates are targeted to the proteasome with few or no ubiquitins is unknown. Here, we report that p97-extracted membrane proteins undergo a second round of ubiquitination catalyzed by the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase RNF126. RNF126 interacts with transmembrane-domain-specific chaperone BAG6, which captures p97-liberated substrates. RNF126 depletion in cells diminishes the ubiquitination of extracted membrane proteins, slows down their turnover, and dramatically stabilizes otherwise transient intermediates in the cytosol. We reconstitute the reubiquitination of a p97-extracted, misfolded multispanning membrane protein with purified factors. Our results demonstrate that p97-extracted substrates need to rapidly engage ubiquitin ligase-chaperone pairs that rebuild the ubiquitin signal for proteasome targeting to prevent harmful accumulation of unfolded intermediates."	1

We use a pre-clinical model of otitis media (OM) to determine the potential role for microevolution of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) during sequential episodes of disease. Whole genome sequencing reveals microevolution of hemoglobin binding and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis genes, suggesting that adaptation of these systems is critical for infection.

Afadin elimination in motor neuron progenitors results in striking locomotor behavior: left-right limb alternation is substituted by synchronous activation, characteristic of bound gait. We find that afadin function at the neuroepithelium is required for structural organization of the spinal midline and central canal morphogenesis. Perturbation of afadin results in formation of two central canals, aberrant contralateral wiring of different classes of spinal premotor interneurons, and loss of left-right limb alternation, highlighting important developmental principles controlling the assembly of spinal motor circuits."	0

Here we show using mouse primary B lymphocytes that SE activity simultaneously associates with chromatin opening and enriched NF-κB binding, resulting in a higher fold change and threshold expression upon B cell receptor (BCR) activation. The higher fold change results from longer DNA, whereas the threshold response is explained by synergy in DNA-NF-κB binding and is supported by the coexistence of PU.1 and NF-κB in a SE before cell stimulation. This model indicates that the pre-existing NF-κB functions as a seed and triggers its processive binding upon BCR activation.

"32433953"	"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals a Dynamic Stromal Niche That Supports Tumor Growth.Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine the stromal compartment in murine melanoma and draining lymph nodes (LNs) at points across tumor development, providing data at http://www.teichlab.org/data/. Naive lymphocytes from LNs undergo activation and clonal expansion within the tumor, before PD1 and Lag3 expression, while tumor-associated myeloid cells promote the formation of a suppressive niche. We identify three temporally distinct stromal populations displaying unique functional signatures, conserved across mouse and human tumors. Whereas ""immune"" stromal cells are observed in early tumors, ""contractile"" cells become more prevalent at later time points. Complement component C3 is specifically expressed in the immune population. Its cleavage product C3a supports the recruitment of C3aR<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and perturbation of C3a and C3aR disrupts immune infiltration, slowing tumor growth. Our results highlight the power of scRNA-seq to identify complex interplays and increase stromal diversity as a tumor develops, revealing that stromal cells acquire the capacity to modulate immune landscapes from early disease."	0
"32348780"	"A Family of Argonaute-Interacting Proteins Gates Nuclear RNAi.Nuclear RNA interference (RNAi) pathways work together with histone modifications to regulate gene expression and enact an adaptive response to transposable RNA elements. In the germline, nuclear RNAi can lead to trans-generational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) of gene silencing. We identified and characterized a family of nuclear Argonaute-interacting proteins (ENRIs) that control the strength and target specificity of nuclear RNAi in C. elegans, ensuring faithful inheritance of epigenetic memories. ENRI-1/2 prevent misloading of the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 with small RNAs that normally effect maternal piRNAs, which prevents precocious nuclear translocation of NRDE-3 in the early embryo. Additionally, they are negative regulators of nuclear RNAi triggered from exogenous sources. Loss of ENRI-3, an unstable protein expressed mostly in the male germline, misdirects the RNAi response to transposable elements and impairs TEI. The ENRIs determine the potency and specificity of nuclear RNAi responses by gating small RNAs into specific nuclear Argonautes."	1
"31494035"	"RNase L Reprograms Translation by Widespread mRNA Turnover Escaped by Antiviral mRNAs.In response to foreign and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), protein kinase R (PKR) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) reprogram translation in mammalian cells. PKR inhibits translation initiation through eIF2α phosphorylation, which triggers stress granule (SG) formation and promotes translation of stress responsive mRNAs. The mechanisms of RNase L-driven translation repression, its contribution to SG assembly, and its regulation of dsRNA stress-induced mRNAs are unknown. We demonstrate that RNase L drives translational shut-off in response to dsRNA by promoting widespread turnover of mRNAs. This alters stress granule assembly and reprograms translation by allowing translation of mRNAs resistant to RNase L degradation, including numerous antiviral mRNAs such as interferon (IFN)-β. Individual cells differentially activate dsRNA responses revealing variation that can affect cellular outcomes. This identifies bulk mRNA degradation and the resistance of antiviral mRNAs as the mechanism by which RNase L reprograms translation in response to dsRNA."	0

Alveolar macrophages normally act to resolve inflammation, but when dysregulated they can provoke ALI. We demonstrate that monocyte-derived macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages) recruited into the airspace upregulate the anti-inflammatory function of alveolar macrophages by suppressing their stimulator of type 1 interferon gene (STING) signaling. Depletion of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages in mice (macrophage<sup>dep</sup> mice) after endotoxin or after Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes expansion of the inflammatory alveolar macrophage population, leading to neutrophil accumulation, irreversible loss of lung vascular barrier function, and lethality. We show that CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages suppress alveolar macrophage-STING signaling via sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Thus, adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) or STING<sup>-/-</sup>, but not SPHK2<sup>-/-</sup>, CD11b monocytes from murine bone marrow into injured macrophage<sup>dep</sup> mice rescue anti-inflammatory alveolar macrophages and reverse lung vascular injury.

"31031083"	"METTL1 Promotes let-7 MicroRNA Processing via m7G Methylation.7-methylguanosine (m7G) is present at mRNA caps and at defined internal positions within tRNAs and rRNAs. However, its detection within low-abundance mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) has been hampered by a lack of sensitive detection strategies. Here, we adapt a chemical reactivity assay to detect internal m7G in miRNAs. Using this technique (Borohydride Reduction sequencing [BoRed-seq]) alongside RNA immunoprecipitation, we identify m7G within a subset of miRNAs that inhibit cell migration. We show that the METTL1 methyltransferase mediates m7G methylation within miRNAs and that this enzyme regulates cell migration via its catalytic activity. Using refined mass spectrometry methods, we map m7G to a single guanosine within the let-7e-5p miRNA. We show that METTL1-mediated methylation augments let-7 miRNA processing by disrupting an inhibitory secondary structure within the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA). These results identify METTL1-dependent N7-methylation of guanosine as a new RNA modification pathway that regulates miRNA structure, biogenesis, and cell migration."	0
"32877683"	"An Epilepsy-Associated GRIN2A Rare Variant Disrupts CaMKIIα Phosphorylation of GluN2A and NMDA Receptor Trafficking.Rare variants in GRIN genes, which encode NMDAR subunits, are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these, GRIN2A, which encodes the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, is widely accepted as an epilepsy-causative gene. Here, we functionally characterize the de novo GluN2A-S1459G mutation identified in an epilepsy patient. We show that S1459 is a CaMKIIα phosphorylation site, and that endogenous phosphorylation is regulated during development and in response to synaptic activity in a dark rearing model. GluN2A-S1459 phosphorylation results in preferential binding of NMDARs to SNX27 and a corresponding decrease in PSD-95 binding, which consequently regulates NMDAR trafficking. Furthermore, the epilepsy-associated GluN2A-S1459G variant displays defects in interactions with both SNX27 and PSD-95, resulting in trafficking deficits, reduced spine density, and decreased excitatory synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate a role for CaMKIIα phosphorylation of GluN2A in receptor targeting and implicate NMDAR trafficking defects as a link to epilepsy."	1
"31495563"	"Transcriptional Responses to IFN-γ Require Mediator Kinase-Dependent Pause Release and Mechanistically Distinct CDK8 and CDK19 Functions.Transcriptional responses to external stimuli remain poorly understood. Using global nuclear run-on followed by sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), we show that CDK8 kinase activity promotes RNA polymerase II pause release in response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a universal cytokine involved in immunity and tumor surveillance. The Mediator kinase module contains CDK8 or CDK19, which are presumed to be functionally redundant. We implemented cortistatin A, chemical genetics, transcriptomics, and other methods to decouple their function while assessing enzymatic versus structural roles. Unexpectedly, CDK8 and CDK19 regulated different gene sets via distinct mechanisms. CDK8-dependent regulation required its kinase activity, whereas CDK19 governed IFN-γ responses through its scaffolding function (i.e., it was kinase independent). Accordingly, CDK8, not CDK19, phosphorylates the STAT1 transcription factor (TF) during IFN-γ stimulation, and CDK8 kinase inhibition blocked activation of JAK-STAT pathway TFs. Cytokines such as IFN-γ rapidly mobilize TFs to ""reprogram"" cellular transcription; our results implicate CDK8 and CDK19 as essential for this transcriptional reprogramming."	1

"32937118"	"The Dorsal Lateral Habenula-Interpeduncular Nucleus Pathway Is Essential for Left-Right-Dependent Decision Making in Zebrafish.How animals behave using suitable information to adapt to the environment is not well known. We address this issue by devising an automated system to let zebrafish exploit either internal (choice of left or right turn) or external (choice of cue color) navigation information to achieve operant behavior by reward reinforcement learning. The results of behavioral task with repeated rule shift indicate that zebrafish can learn operant behavior using both internal-directional and external-cued information. The learning time is reduced as rule shifts are repeated, revealing the capacity of zebrafish to adaptively retrieve the suitable rule memory after training. Zebrafish with an impairment in the neural pathway from the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus, known to be potentiated in the winners of social conflicts, show specific defects in the application of the internal-directional rule, suggesting the dual roles of this pathway."	0

Based on this finding, we developed a tool named VECTOR that infers vectors of developmental directions for cells in Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). In seven datasets of different developmental scenarios, VECTOR correctly identifies the starting cells and successfully infers the vectors of developmental directions.

Here, we report that in vivo supplementation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) efficaciously improves the quality of oocytes from naturally aged mice by recovering nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) levels. NMN supplementation not only increases ovulation of aged oocytes but also enhances their meiotic competency and fertilization ability by maintaining the normal spindle/chromosome structure and the dynamics of the cortical granule component ovastacin. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the beneficial effect of NMN on aged oocytes is mediated by restoration of mitochondrial function, eliminating the accumulated ROS to suppress apoptosis. Collectively, our data reveal that NMN supplementation is a feasible approach to protect oocytes from advanced maternal age-related deterioration, contributing to the improvement of reproductive outcome of aged women and assisted reproductive technology."	0
"32817126"	"A protein folding intermediate pulls its weight.Proteins must acquire and maintain a specific fold to execute their biochemical function(s). In solution, unfolded proteins typically find this native structure through a biased sampling of preferred intermediate conformations. However, the initial search for these structures begins during protein synthesis, and it is unclear how much interactions between the ribosome and nascent polypeptide skew folding pathways. In this issue, Jensen and colleagues use a ribosomal force-profiling assay to show that RNase H forms a similar folding intermediate on and off the ribosome. In conjunction with measurements of the rate of RNase H unfolding on and off the ribosome, their results show that ribosomal interactions have little impact on the folding pathway of RNase H. These findings suggest that the ribosome itself does not necessarily rewire protein folding reactions."	0
"30853401"	"Spatiotemporal Control of ULK1 Activation by NDP52 and TBK1 during Selective Autophagy.Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis."	1
"32783941"	"Signaling from Plastid Genome Stability Modulates Endoreplication and Cell Cycle during Plant Development.Plastid-nucleus genome coordination is crucial for plastid activity, but the mechanisms remain unclear. By treating Arabidopsis plants with the organellar genome-damaging agent ciprofloxacin, we found that plastid genome instability can alter endoreplication and the cell cycle. Similar results are observed in the plastid genome instability mutants of reca1why1why3. Cell division and embryo development are disturbed in the reca1why1why3 mutant. Notably, SMR5 and SMR7 genes, which encode cell-cycle kinase inhibitors, are upregulated in plastid genome instability plants, and the mutation of SMR7 can restore the endoreplication and growth phenotype of reca1why1why3 plants. Furthermore, we establish that the DNA damage response transcription factor SOG1 mediates the alteration of endoreplication and cell cycle triggered by plastid genome instability. Finally, we demonstrate that reactive oxygen species produced in plastids are important for plastid-nucleus genome coordination. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism for the coordination of plastid and nuclear genomes during plant growth and development."	0

Targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies exemplified by PROTACs are rapidly emerging as modalities in drug discovery. However, the scope of current TPD techniques is limited because many intracellular materials are not substrates of proteasomal clearance. Here, we described a novel targeted-clearance strategy (autophagy-targeting chimera [AUTAC]) that contains a degradation tag (guanine derivatives) and a warhead to provide target specificity. As expected from the substrate scope of autophagy, AUTAC degraded fragmented mitochondria as well as proteins. Mitochondria-targeted AUTAC accelerated both the removal of dysfunctional fragmented mitochondria and the biogenesis of functionally normal mitochondria in patient-derived fibroblast cells. Cytoprotective effects against acute mitochondrial injuries were also seen. Canonical autophagy is viewed as a nonselective bulk decomposition system, and none of the available autophagy-inducing agents exhibit useful cargo selectivity. With its target specificity, AUTAC provides a new modality for research on autophagy-based drugs."	0
"31914392"	"Thermosensitive Nucleosome Editing Reveals the Role of DNA Sequence in Targeted Histone Variant Deposition.In preparation for transcription, the chromatin remodeler SWR installs homotypic ZZ nucleosomes at promoters by replacing the two nucleosomal H2A with H2A.Z in a stepwise manner. Nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) help recruit SWR to promoters; this is thought to position SWR asymmetrically on one side of the +1 nucleosome. How SWR accesses the opposite side of +1 to generate a ZZ nucleosome remains unclear. Using biochemical assays that monitor the sub-nucleosomal position of nascent H2A.Z, we find that NFR-recruited SWR switches sides to insert H2A.Z into asymmetrically positioned nucleosomes; however, at decreasing temperatures, H2A.Z insertion becomes progressively biased for one side. We find that a 16-bp element containing G/C runs (>3 consecutive G or C nucleotides) is sufficient to promote H2A.Z insertion. Because H2A.Z-rich +1 nucleosomes in yeast have more G/C runs, we propose that nucleosome editing is a thermosensitive process that can be hard coded by the genome."	0

"32905772"	"Legionella Manipulates Non-canonical SNARE Pairing Using a Bacterial Deubiquitinase.The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila uses many effector proteins delivered by the bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS) to hijack the early secretory pathway to establish its replicative niche, known as the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). On LCV biogenesis, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (v-SNARE) Sec22b is recruited to the bacterial phagosome and forms non-canonical pairings with target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs) from the plasma membrane. Here, we identify a Legionella deubiquitinase (DUB), LotB, that can modulate the early secretory pathway by interacting with coatomer protein complex I (COPI) vesicles when ectopically expressed. We show that Sec22b is ubiquitinated upon L. pneumophila infection in a T4SS-dependent manner and that, subsequently, LotB deconjugates K63-linked ubiquitins from Sec22b. The DUB activity of LotB stimulates dissociation of the t-SNARE syntaxin 3 (Stx3) from Sec22b, which resides on the LCV. Our study highlights a bacterial strategy manipulating the dynamics of infection-induced SNARE pairing using a bacterial DUB."	0
"32521271"	"TLR7 Sensing by Neutrophils Is Critical for the Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, where they kill invading pathogens. However, they may also act as early temporary shelters, favoring subsequent pathogen dissemination in the host. We find that TLR7 sensing of the protozoan Leishmania parasite in neutrophils is essential for early parasite load regulation. Neutrophil effector functions, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, are decreased in the absence of TLR7, resulting in higher parasite load and selective parasite replication in Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils. Leishmania-infected Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> mice develop a chronic unhealing lesion, despite Th1 cell differentiation, and we show that Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils alone mediate this effect. Conversely, topical treatment with a TLR7 agonist early in infection induces smaller lesion development than in untreated mice. Collectively, these findings highlight that parasite TLR7 triggering in neutrophils regulates early innate functions with major consequences on subsequent disease evolution, opening avenues for possible treatment strategies."	0

Bacteriophage- or prophage-region-encoded anti-CRISPR (acr) gene molecules provide the potential to control targeting specificity and potency to allow for optimal RNA editing and nucleic acid detection by spatiotemporally modulating endonuclease activities. Using integrated approaches to screen acrVI candidates and evaluate their effects on Cas13 function, we discovered a series of acrVIA1-7 genes that block the activities of Cas13a. These VI-A CRISPR inhibitors substantially attenuate RNA targeting and editing by Cas13a in human cells. Strikingly, type VI-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVIAs) also significantly muffle the single-nucleic-acid editing ability of the dCas13a RNA-editing system. Mechanistically, AcrVIA1, -4, -5, and -6 bind LwaCas13a, while AcrVIA2 and -3 can only bind the LwaCas13-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) complex.

We found that during late S and in G2, the degradation of all three activator E2Fs is controlled by cyclin F, the substrate receptor of 1 of 69 human SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3A interact with the cyclin box of cyclin F via their conserved N-terminal cyclin binding motifs. In the short term, E2F mutants unable to bind cyclin F remain stable throughout the cell cycle, induce unscheduled transcription in G2 and mitosis, and promote faster entry into the next S phase. However, in the long term, they impair cell fitness. We propose that by restricting E2F activity to the S phase, cyclin F controls one of the main and most critical transcriptional engines of the cell cycle."	1

Poor response rates have been unequivocally shown in mutant KRAS and are even observed in a majority of wild-type KRAS tumors. Therefore, patient selection based on mutational profiling remains problematic. We previously identified methylglyoxal (MGO), a by-product of glycolysis, as a metabolite promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Mutant KRAS cells under MGO stress show AKT-dependent survival when compared with wild-type KRAS isogenic CRC cells. MGO induces AKT activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) and Hsp27 regulation. Importantly, the sole induction of MGO stress in sensitive wild-type KRAS cells renders them resistant to cetuximab.

Moreover, BCL11A promotes cancer cell invasion by suppressing the expression of muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 (<i>MBNL1</i>), a splicing regulator that suppresses metastasis. This ultimately increases the levels of an alternatively spliced isoform of integrin-α6 (<i>ITGA6</i>), which is associated with worse patient outcomes.

We used CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer human cell lines expressing POLE tumor variants, with and without mismatch repair (MMR). Whole-exome sequencing of these cells after defined numbers of population doublings permitted analysis of nascent mutation accumulation. Unlike an exonuclease active site mutant that we previously characterized, POLE cancer mutants readily drive signature mutagenesis in the presence of functional MMR. Comparison of cell line and human patient data suggests that the relative abundance of mutation signatures partitions POLE tumors into distinct subgroups dependent on the nature of the POLE allele, its expression level, and MMR status.

"31732458"	"DNA Methylation and Histone H1 Jointly Repress Transposable Elements and Aberrant Intragenic Transcripts.DNA methylation and histone H1 mediate transcriptional silencing of genes and transposable elements, but how they interact is unclear. In plants and animals with mosaic genomic methylation, functionally mysterious methylation is also common within constitutively active housekeeping genes. Here, we show that H1 is enriched in methylated sequences, including genes, of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet this enrichment is independent of DNA methylation. Loss of H1 disperses heterochromatin, globally alters nucleosome organization, and activates H1-bound genes, but only weakly de-represses transposable elements. However, H1 loss strongly activates transposable elements hypomethylated through mutation of DNA methyltransferase MET1. Hypomethylation of genes also activates antisense transcription, which is modestly enhanced by H1 loss. Our results demonstrate that H1 and DNA methylation jointly maintain transcriptional homeostasis by silencing transposable elements and aberrant intragenic transcripts. Such functionality plausibly explains why DNA methylation, a well-known mutagen, has been maintained within coding sequences of crucial plant and animal genes."	0

Here, we investigate how CTD length and disorder influence transcription. We find that length modulates the size and frequency of transcriptional bursting. Disorder is highly conserved and facilitates CTD-CTD interactions, an ability we show is separable from protein sequence and necessary for efficient transcription. We build a data-driven quantitative model, simulations of which recapitulate experiments and support that CTD length promotes initial polymerase recruitment to the promoter and slows down its release from it and that CTD-CTD interactions enable recruitment of multiple polymerases. Our results reveal how these parameters provide access to a range of transcriptional activity, offering a new perspective for the mechanistic significance of CTD length and disorder in transcription across eukaryotes."	0

Glia play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic formation. However, how presynaptic neurons assemble synaptic structure in response to the glial signals remains largely unexplored. To address this question, we use cima-1 mutant C. elegans as an in vivo model, in which the astrocyte-like VCSC glial processes ectopically reach an asynaptic neurite region and promote presynaptic formation there. Through an RNAi screen, we find that the Rho GTPase CDC-42 and IQGAP PES-7 are required in presynaptic neurons for VCSC glia-induced presynaptic formation. In addition, we find that cdc-42 and pes-7 are also required for normal synaptogenesis during postembryonic developmental stages.

Very important to human medicine, GPCRs are targeted by about 35% of prescription drugs. GPCRs are characterized by a seven-transmembrane α-helical structure, transmitting extracellular signals into cells to regulate major physiological processes via heterotrimeric G proteins and β-arrestins. Initially viewed as receptors whose signaling via G proteins is delimited to the plasma membrane, it is now recognized that GPCRs signal also at various intracellular locations, and the mechanisms and (patho)physiological relevance of such signaling modes are actively investigated. The propensity of GPCRs to adopt different signaling modes is largely encoded in the structural plasticity of the receptors themselves and of their signaling complexes. Here, we review emerging modes of GPCR signaling via endosomal membranes and the physiological implications of such signaling modes. We further summarize recent structural insights into mechanisms of GPCR activation and signaling. We particularly emphasize the structural mechanisms governing the continued GPCR signaling from endosomes and the structural aspects of the GPCR resensitization mechanism and discuss the recently uncovered and important roles of lipids in these processes."	0
"32499401"	"Competition between maturation and degradation drives human snRNA 3' end quality control.Polymerases and exonucleases act on 3' ends of nascent RNAs to promote their maturation or degradation but how the balance between these activities is controlled to dictate the fates of cellular RNAs remains poorly understood.

We found that TOE1 promotes maturation of all regular RNA polymerase II transcribed snRNAs of the major and minor spliceosomes by removing posttranscriptional oligo(A) tails, trimming 3' ends, and preventing nuclear exosome targeting. In contrast, TOE1 promotes little to no maturation of tested U1 variant snRNAs, which are instead targeted by the nuclear exosome. These observations suggest that TOE1 is positioned at the center of a 3' end quality control pathway that selectively promotes maturation and stability of regular snRNAs while leaving snRNA variants unprocessed and exposed to degradation in what could be a widespread mechanism of RNA quality control given the large number of noncoding RNAs processed by DEDD deadenylases."	0

To understand the molecular interactions underlying these functions, we used solution biophysics to characterize binding of δ1- and δ2-protocadherins, determined crystal structures of ectodomain complexes from each family, and assessed ectodomain assembly in reconstituted intermembrane junctions by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). Homophilic trans (cell-cell) interactions were preferred for all δ-protocadherins, with additional weaker heterophilic interactions observed exclusively within each subfamily. As expected, δ1- and δ2-protocadherin trans dimers formed through antiparallel EC1-EC4 interfaces, like clustered protocadherins. However, no ectodomain-mediated cis (same-cell) interactions were detectable in solution; consistent with this, cryo-ET of reconstituted junctions revealed dense assemblies lacking the characteristic order observed for clustered protocadherins. Our results define non-clustered protocadherin binding properties and their structural basis, providing a foundation for interpreting their functional roles in neural patterning."	0
"32553168"	"Low-Dose Vertical Inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK Cascade Causes Apoptotic Death of KRAS Mutant Cancers.We address whether combinations with a pan-RAF inhibitor (RAFi) would be effective in KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Chemical library and CRISPR genetic screens identify combinations causing apoptotic anti-tumor activity. The most potent combination, concurrent inhibition of RAF (RAFi) and ERK (ERKi), is highly synergistic at low doses in cell line, organoid, and rat models of PDAC, whereas each inhibitor alone is only cytostatic. Comprehensive mechanistic signaling studies using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) pathway mapping and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) show that RAFi/ERKi induced insensitivity to loss of negative feedback and system failures including loss of ERK signaling, FOSL1, and MYC; shutdown of the MYC transcriptome; and induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. We conclude that low-dose vertical inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade is an effective therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant PDAC."	0
"31227231"	"HCF-1 Regulates De Novo Lipogenesis through a Nutrient-Sensitive Complex with ChREBP.Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a key transcriptional regulator of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in response to carbohydrates and in hepatic steatosis. Mechanisms underlying nutrient modulation of ChREBP are under active investigation. Here we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as a previously unknown ChREBP-interacting protein that is enriched in liver biopsies of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Biochemical and genetic studies show that HCF-1 is O-GlcNAcylated in response to glucose as a prerequisite for its binding to ChREBP and subsequent recruitment of OGT, ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation, and activation. The HCF-1:ChREBP complex resides at lipogenic gene promoters, where HCF-1 regulates H3K4 trimethylation to prime recruitment of the Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylase PHF2 for epigenetic activation of these promoters. Overall, these findings define HCF-1's interaction with ChREBP as a previously unappreciated mechanism whereby glucose signals are both relayed to ChREBP and transmitted for epigenetic regulation of lipogenic genes."	1

However, the glycosphingolipid synthases required for production of these ceramides have not been well-characterized. Here, we report the identification and characterization of glucuronosylceramide synthase (ceramide UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [Cer-GlcAT]) in Z<i>ymomonas mobilis</i>, a Gram-negative bacterium whose cellular membranes contain glucuronosylceramide. On comparing the gene sequences that encode the diacylglycerol GlcAT in bacteria and plants, we found a homologous gene that is widely distributed in the order <i>Sphingomonadales</i> in the <i>Z. mobilis</i> genome. We first cloned the gene and expressed it in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, followed by protein purification using nickel-Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Using the highly enriched enzyme, we observed that it has high glycosyltransferase activity with UDP-glucuronic acid and ceramide as sugar donor and acceptor substrate, respectively. Cer-GlcAT deletion resulted in a loss of glucuronosylceramide and increased the levels of ceramide phosphoglycerol, which was expressed in WT cells only at very low levels. Furthermore, we found sequences homologous to Cer-GlcAT in <i>Sphingobium yanoikuyae</i> and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, which have been reported to produce glucuronosylceramide and α-galactosylceramide, respectively. We expressed the two homologs of the <i>cer-glcat</i> gene in <i>E. coli</i> and found that each gene encodes Cer-GlcAT and Cer-galactosyltransferase, respectively. These results contribute to the understanding of the roles of bacterial glycosphingolipids in host-bacteria interactions and the function of bacterial glycosphingolipids in bacterial physiology."	0
"32268081"	"Insights into Gonadal Sex Differentiation Provided by Single-Cell Transcriptomics in the Chicken Embryo.Although the genetic triggers for gonadal sex differentiation vary across species, the cell biology of gonadal development was long thought to be largely conserved. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gonadal sex differentiation, using single-cell sequencing in the embryonic chicken gonad during sexual differentiation. The data show that chicken embryonic-supporting cells do not derive from the coelomic epithelium, in contrast to other vertebrates studied. Instead, they derive from a DMRT1<sup>+</sup>/PAX2<sup>+</sup>/WNT4<sup>+</sup>/OSR1<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cell population. We find a greater complexity of gonadal cell types than previously thought, including the identification of two distinct sub-populations of Sertoli cells in developing testes and derivation of embryonic steroidogenic cells from a differentiated supporting-cell lineage. Altogether, these results indicate that, just as the genetic trigger for sex differs across vertebrate groups, cell lineage specification in the gonad may also vary substantially."	0

Yet, key steps involved in trafficking of antigens taken up by DCs remain incompletely understood. Here, we screen 700 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and identify 37 enhancers of antigen import from endolysosomes into the cytosol. To reveal their mechanism of action, we generate proteomic organellar maps of control and drug-treated DCs (focusing on two compounds, prazosin and tamoxifen). By combining organellar mapping, quantitative proteomics, and microscopy, we conclude that import enhancers undergo lysosomal trapping leading to membrane permeation and antigen release. Enhancing antigen import facilitates cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated antigens. Systemic administration of prazosin leads to reduced growth of MC38 tumors and to a synergistic effect with checkpoint immunotherapy in a melanoma model. Thus, inefficient antigen import into the cytosol limits antigen cross-presentation, restraining the potency of anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of checkpoint blockers."	0

As the sole member of the Arabidopsis MSL family localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, MSL1 is essential to maintain the normal membrane potential of mitochondria. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Arabidopsis thaliana MSL1 (AtMSL1) at 3.3 Å. The overall architecture of AtMSL1 is similar to MscS. However, the transmembrane domain of AtMSL1 is larger. Structural differences are observed in both the transmembrane and the matrix domain of AtMSL1. The carboxyl-terminus of AtMSL1 is more flexible and the β-barrel structure observed in MscS is absent. The side portals in AtMSL1 are significantly smaller, and enlarging the size of the portal by mutagenesis can increase the channel conductance. Our study provides a framework for eukaryotic MscS-like mechanosensitive ion channels and the gating mechanism of the MscS family."	0

Here we present an approach combining in silico prediction with targeted mass spectrometry (MS) to identify Lys methylation (Kme) sites at the proteome level. We develop MethylSight, a program that predicts Kme events solely on the physicochemical properties of residues surrounding the putative methylation sites, which then requires validation by targeted MS. Using this approach, we identify 70 new histone Kme marks with a 90% validation rate. H2BK43me2, which undergoes dynamic changes during stem cell differentiation, is found to be a substrate of KDM5b. Furthermore, MethylSight predicts that Lys methylation is a prevalent post-translational modification in the human proteome. Our work provides a useful resource for guiding systematic exploration of the role of Lys methylation in human health and disease."	0

However, how to leverage cellular signaling to ablate TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein for PCa treatment remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage induces proteasomal degradation of wild-type ERG and TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein through ERG threonine-187 and tyrosine-190 phosphorylation mediated by GSK3β and WEE1, respectively. The dual phosphorylation triggers ERG recognition and degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7 in a manner independent of a canonical degron. DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG degradation was abolished by cancer-associated PTEN deletion or GSK3β inactivation. Blockade of DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein degradation causes chemotherapy-resistant growth of fusion-positive PCa cells in culture and in mice. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized TMPRSS2-ERG protein destruction mechanism and demonstrate that intact PTEN and GSK3β signaling are essential for effective targeting of ERG protein by genotoxic therapeutics in fusion-positive PCa."	0
"32023470"	"OTUB1 Is a Key Regulator of RIG-I-Dependent Immune Signaling and Is Targeted for Proteasomal Degradation by Influenza A NS1.Deubiquitylases (DUBs) regulate critical signaling pathways at the intersection of host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Although RIG-I activation is heavily dependent on ubiquitylation, systematic analyses of DUBs that regulate this pathway have not been performed. Using a ubiquitin C-terminal electrophile, we profile DUBs that function during influenza A virus (IAV) infection and isolate OTUB1 as a key regulator of RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Upon infection, OTUB1 relocalizes from the nucleus to mitochondrial membranes together with RIG-I, viral PB2, and NS1. Its expression depends on competing effects of interferon stimulation and IAV-triggered degradation. OTUB1 activates RIG-I via a dual mechanism of K48 polyubiquitin hydrolysis and formation of an E2-repressive complex with UBCH5c. We reconstitute this mechanism in a cell-free system comprising [<sup>35</sup>S]IRF3, purified RIG-I, mitochondrial membranes, and cytosol expressing OTUB1 variants. A range of IAV NS1 proteins trigger proteasomal degradation of OTUB1, antagonizing the RIG-I signaling cascade and antiviral responses."	1

To study roles for <i>MYCN</i> amplification in SCLC progression and chemoresistance, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing SCLC. In treatment-naïve mice, <i>MYCN</i> overexpression promoted cell cycle progression, suppressed infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and accelerated SCLC. <i>MYCN</i> overexpression also suppressed response to cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy, with similar findings made upon <i>MYCL</i> overexpression. We extended these data to genetically perturb chemosensitive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC. In chemosensitive PDX models, overexpression of either <i>MYCN</i> or <i>MYCL</i> also conferred a switch to chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic strategies for <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing SCLC, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA screen. We identified the deubiquitinase USP7 as a <i>MYCN</i>-associated synthetic vulnerability. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 resensitized chemoresistant <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing PDX models to chemotherapy in vivo. Our findings show that <i>MYCN</i> overexpression drives SCLC chemoresistance and provide a therapeutic strategy to restore chemosensitivity."	0
"32755583"	"Macrophage K63-Linked Ubiquitination of YAP Promotes Its Nuclear Localization and Exacerbates Atherosclerosis.The Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway has pivotal roles in innate immune responses against pathogens in macrophages. However, the role of YAP in macrophages during atherosclerosis and its mechanism of YAP activation remain unknown. Here, we find that YAP overexpression in myeloid cells aggravates atherosclerotic lesion size and infiltration of macrophages, whereas YAP deficiency reduces atherosclerotic plaque. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a downstream effector of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), triggers YAP ubiquitination at K252, which interrupts the interaction between YAP and angiomotin and results in enhanced YAP nuclear translocation. The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra reduces atherosclerotic lesion formation, which is abrogated by YAP overexpression. YAP level is increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic vessels, and plasma IL-1β level in patients with STEMI is correlated with YAP protein level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These findings elucidate a mechanism of YAP activation, which might be a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis."	0
"31940485"	"Intersectin-Mediated Clearance of SNARE Complexes Is Required for Fast Neurotransmission.The rapid replenishment of release-ready synaptic vesicles (SVs) at a limiting number of presynaptic release sites is required to sustain high-frequency neurotransmission in CNS neurons. Failure to clear release sites from previously exocytosed material has been shown to impair vesicle replenishment and, therefore, fast neurotransmission. The identity of this material and the machinery that removes it from release sites have remained enigmatic. Here we show that the endocytic scaffold protein intersectin 1 clears release sites by direct SH3 domain-mediated association with a non-canonical proline-rich segment of synaptobrevin assembled into the SNARE complex for neuroexocytosis. Acute structure-based or sustained genetic interference with SNARE complex recognition by intersectin 1 causes a rapid stimulation frequency-dependent depression of neurotransmission due to impaired replenishment of release-ready SVs. These findings identify a key molecular mechanism that underlies exo-endocytic coupling during fast neurotransmitter release at central synapses."	0
"32187534"	"Spatiotemporal Decline of BMP Signaling Activity in Neural Progenitors Mediates Fate Transition and Safeguards Neurogenesis.Neural progenitors undergo temporal fate transition to generate diversified neurons in stereotyped sequence during development. However, the molecular machineries driving progenitor fate change remain unclear. Here, using the cerebellum as a platform, we demonstrate that the temporal dynamics of a dorsoventral bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling gradient orchestrates the transition from early to late phase of neurogenesis. Initially, high BMP/SMAD activity in cerebellum neural progenitors transcriptionally represses the late-born interneuron fate determinant Gsx1. As development proceeds, gradual decline in SMAD activities from ventral to dorsal progenitors progressively alleviates suppression on Gsx1 and allows transition of progenitor fate. Manipulating the BMP signaling dynamics can either lead to an immediate halt or rapid acceleration of the temporal fate switch, thus unbalancing the generation of distinct neuronal populations. Our study thus demonstrates that neural progenitors possess inherent competence to produce late-born neurons, yet identity transition is mechanistically executed by precisely timed and positioned reduction of repressors for late-fate determinants."	0
"32367046"	"In vitro capture and characterization of embryonic rosette-stage pluripotency between naive and primed states.Following implantation, the naive pluripotent epiblast of the mouse blastocyst generates a rosette, undergoes lumenogenesis and forms the primed pluripotent egg cylinder, which is able to generate the embryonic tissues. How pluripotency progression and morphogenesis are linked and whether intermediate pluripotent states exist remain controversial. We identify here a rosette pluripotent state defined by the co-expression of naive factors with the transcription factor OTX2. Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2. The rosette then activates MEK signals that induce lumenogenesis and drive progression to primed pluripotency. Consequently, combined WNT and MEK inhibition supports rosette-like stem cells, a self-renewing naive-primed intermediate. Rosette-like stem cells erase constitutive heterochromatin marks and display a primed chromatin landscape, with bivalently marked primed pluripotency genes. Nonetheless, WNT induces reversion to naive pluripotency. The rosette is therefore a reversible pluripotent intermediate whereby control over both pluripotency progression and morphogenesis pivots from WNT to MEK signals."	0
"32097603"	"Organization of the Escherichia coli Chromosome by a MukBEF Axial Core.Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes organize chromosomes ubiquitously, thereby contributing to their faithful segregation. We demonstrate that under conditions of increased chromosome occupancy of the Escherichia coli SMC complex, MukBEF, the chromosome is organized as a series of loops around a thin (<130 nm) MukBEF axial core, whose length is ∼1,100 times shorter than the chromosomal DNA. The linear order of chromosomal loci is maintained in the axial cores, whose formation requires MukBEF ATP hydrolysis. Axial core structure in non-replicating chromosomes is predominantly linear (1 μm) but becomes circular (1.5 μm) in the absence of MatP because of its failure to displace MukBEF from the 800 kbp replication termination region (ter). Displacement of MukBEF from ter by MatP in wild-type cells directs MukBEF colocalization with the replication origin. We conclude that MukBEF individualizes and compacts the chromosome lengthwise, demonstrating a chromosome organization mechanism similar to condensin in mitotic chromosome formation."	0
"32753672"	"Mammalian Atg8 proteins and the autophagy factor IRGM control mTOR and TFEB at a regulatory node critical for responses to pathogens.Autophagy is a homeostatic process with multiple functions in mammalian cells. Here, we show that mammalian Atg8 proteins (mAtg8s) and the autophagy regulator IRGM control TFEB, a transcriptional activator of the lysosomal system. IRGM directly interacted with TFEB and promoted the nuclear translocation of TFEB. An mAtg8 partner of IRGM, GABARAP, interacted with TFEB. Deletion of all mAtg8s or GABARAPs affected the global transcriptional response to starvation and downregulated subsets of TFEB targets. IRGM and GABARAPs countered the action of mTOR as a negative regulator of TFEB. This was suppressed by constitutively active RagB, an activator of mTOR. Infection of macrophages with the membrane-permeabilizing microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis or infection of target cells by HIV elicited TFEB activation in an IRGM-dependent manner. Thus, IRGM and its interactors mAtg8s close a loop between the autophagosomal pathway and the control of lysosomal biogenesis by TFEB, thus ensuring coordinated activation of the two systems that eventually merge during autophagy."	1

Here, we re-examine this issue in the Drosophila melanogaster wing and notum using split-Gal4 co-expression analysis, multiplex somatic CRISPR, and double RNAi experiments. Pairwise loss-of-function experiments targeting wg together with other Wnt genes, via somatic CRISPR or RNAi, do not produce PCP defects in the wing or notum. In addition, somatic CRISPR against evi (aka wntless), which is required for the secretion of Wnt ligands, did not produce detectable PCP phenotypes. Altogether, our results do not support the hypothesis that Wnt ligands contribute to PCP signaling in the Drosophila wing or notum."	0
"32905766"	"Mapping Neutralizing Antibody Epitope Specificities to an HIV Env Trimer in Immunized and in Infected Rhesus Macaques.BG505 SOSIP is a well-characterized near-native recombinant HIV Envelope (Env) trimer that holds promise as part of a sequential HIV immunogen regimen to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Rhesus macaques are considered the most appropriate pre-clinical animal model for monitoring antibody (Ab) responses. Accordingly, we report here the isolation of 45 BG505 autologous neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) with multiple specificities from SOSIP-immunized and BG505 SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. We associate the most potent neutralization with two epitopes: the C3/V5 and V1/V3 regions. We show that all of the nAbs bind in close proximity to known bnAb epitopes and might therefore sterically hinder elicitation of bnAbs. We also identify a ""public clonotype"" that targets the immunodominant C3/V5 nAb epitope, which suggests that common antibody rearrangements might help determine humoral responses to Env immunogens. The results highlight important considerations for vaccine design in anticipation of results of the BG505 SOSIP trimer in clinical trials."	0

ADP-ribosylation of Glu35 and the subsequent reduction of H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation inhibits the differentiation of adipocyte precursors in cultured cells. Parp1 knockout in preadipocytes in a mouse lineage-tracing genetic model increases adipogenesis, leading to obesity.

Here, we study a highly specialized small object motion detector, LC11, and demonstrate that its responses are suppressed by local background motion. We show that LC11 expresses GABA-A receptors that serve to sculpt responses to small objects but are not responsible for the rejection of background motion. Instead, LC11 is innervated by columnar T2 and T3 neurons that are themselves highly sensitive to small static or moving objects, insensitive to wide-field motion and, unlike T4/T5, respond to both ON and OFF luminance steps."	0
"32001511"	"HELLS and PRDM9 form a pioneer complex to open chromatin at meiotic recombination hot spots.Chromatin barriers prevent spurious interactions between regulatory elements and DNA-binding proteins. One such barrier, whose mechanism for overcoming is poorly understood, is access to recombination hot spots during meiosis. Here we show that the chromatin remodeler HELLS and DNA-binding protein PRDM9 function together to open chromatin at hot spots and provide access for the DNA double-strand break (DSB) machinery. Recombination hot spots are decorated by a unique combination of histone modifications not found at other regulatory elements. HELLS is recruited to hot spots by PRDM9 and is necessary for both histone modifications and DNA accessibility at hot spots. In male mice lacking HELLS, DSBs are retargeted to other sites of open chromatin, leading to germ cell death and sterility. Together, these data provide a model for hot spot activation in which HELLS and PRDM9 form a pioneer complex to create a unique epigenomic environment of open chromatin, permitting correct placement and repair of DSBs."	1
"32075754"	"Sen1 Is Recruited to Replication Forks via Ctf4 and Mrc1 and Promotes Genome Stability.DNA replication and RNA transcription compete for the same substrate during S phase. Cells have evolved several mechanisms to minimize such conflicts. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the transcription termination helicase Sen1 associates with replisomes. We show that the N terminus of Sen1 is both sufficient and necessary for replisome association and that it binds to the replisome via the components Ctf4 and Mrc1. We generated a separation of function mutant, sen1-3, which abolishes replisome binding without affecting transcription termination. We observe that the sen1-3 mutants show increased genome instability and recombination levels. Moreover, sen1-3 is synthetically defective with mutations in genes involved in RNA metabolism and the S phase checkpoint. RNH1 overexpression suppresses defects in the former, but not the latter. These findings illustrate how Sen1 plays a key function at replication forks during DNA replication to promote fork progression and chromosome stability."	1

However, the mechanism underlying selective autophagy of condensates and whether liquidity determines a condensate's susceptibility to degradation by autophagy remain unknown. Here, we show that the selective autophagic cargo aminopeptidase I (Ape1) undergoes phase separation to form semi-liquid droplets. The Ape1-specific receptor protein Atg19 localizes to the surface of Ape1 droplets both in vitro and in vivo, with the ""floatability"" of Atg19 preventing its penetration into droplets. In vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that Atg19 and lipidated Atg8 are necessary and sufficient for selective sequestration of Ape1 droplets by membranes. This sequestration is impaired by mutational solidification of Ape1 droplets or diminished ability of Atg19 to float. Taken together, we propose that cargo liquidity and the presence of sufficient amounts of autophagic receptor on cargo are crucial for selective autophagy of biomolecular condensates."	0
"32032532"	"Regulation of Cohesin-Mediated Chromosome Folding by Eco1 and Other Partners.Cohesin, a member of the SMC complex family, holds sister chromatids together but also shapes chromosomes by promoting the formation of long-range intra-chromatid loops, a process proposed to be mediated by DNA loop extrusion. Here we describe the roles of three cohesin partners, Pds5, Wpl1, and Eco1, in loop formation along either unreplicated or mitotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. Pds5 limits the size of DNA loops via two different pathways: the canonical Wpl1-mediated releasing activity and an Eco1-dependent mechanism. In the absence of Pds5, the main barrier to DNA loop expansion appears to be the centromere. Our data also show that Eco1 acetyl-transferase inhibits the translocase activity that powers loop formation and contributes to the positioning of loops through a mechanism that is distinguishable from its role in cohesion establishment. This study reveals that the mechanisms regulating cohesin-dependent chromatin loops are conserved among eukaryotes while promoting different functions."	0
"32354834"	"The spatial regulation of condensin activity in chromosome condensation.Condensin mediates chromosome condensation, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Prior to anaphase of budding yeast, the ribosomal DNA (RDN) condenses to a thin loop that is distinct from the rest of the chromosomes. We provide evidence that the establishment and maintenance of this RDN condensation requires the regulation of condensin by Cdc5p (polo) kinase. We show that Cdc5p is recruited to the site of condensin binding in the RDN by cohesin, a complex related to condensin. Cdc5p and cohesin prevent condensin from misfolding the RDN into an irreversibly decondensed state. From these and other observations, we propose that the spatial regulation of Cdc5p by cohesin modulates condensin activity to ensure proper RDN folding into a thin loop. This mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved, promoting the thinly condensed constrictions that occur at centromeres and RDN of mitotic chromosomes in plants and animals."	0

We find that mitochondria in retinas adapt to their hypoxic environment by reversing the succinate dehydrogenase reaction to use fumarate to accept electrons instead of O<sub>2</sub>. Reverse succinate dehydrogenase activity produces succinate and is enhanced by hypoxia-induced downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. Retinas can export the succinate they produce to the neighboring O<sub>2</sub>-rich retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex. There, succinate enhances O<sub>2</sub> consumption by severalfold. Malate made from succinate in the pigment epithelium can then be imported into the retina, where it is converted to fumarate to again accept electrons in the reverse succinate dehydrogenase reaction. This malate-succinate shuttle can sustain these two tissues by transferring reducing power from an O<sub>2</sub>-poor tissue (retina) to an O<sub>2</sub>-rich one (retinal pigment epithelium-choroid)."	0

"32294436"	"Glioma-Induced Alterations in Neuronal Activity and Neurovascular Coupling during Disease Progression.Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are known to cause alterations in cortical function, vascular disruption, and seizures. These neurological complications present major clinical challenges, yet their underlying mechanisms and causal relationships to disease progression are poorly characterized. Here, we follow glioma progression in awake Thy1-GCaMP6f mice using in vivo wide-field optical mapping to monitor alterations in both neuronal activity and functional hemodynamics. The bilateral synchrony of spontaneous neuronal activity gradually decreases in glioma-infiltrated cortical regions, while neurovascular coupling becomes progressively disrupted compared to uninvolved cortex. Over time, mice develop diverse patterns of high amplitude discharges and eventually generalized seizures that appear to originate at the tumors' infiltrative margins. Interictal and seizure events exhibit positive neurovascular coupling in uninfiltrated cortex; however, glioma-infiltrated regions exhibit disrupted hemodynamic responses driving seizure-evoked hypoxia. These results reveal a landscape of complex physiological interactions occurring during glioma progression and present new opportunities for exploring novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets."	0
"32492419"	"A Dynamic Splicing Program Ensures Proper Synaptic Connections in the Developing Cerebellum.Tight coordination of gene expression in the developing cerebellum is crucial for establishment of neuronal circuits governing motor and cognitive function. However, transcriptional changes alone do not explain all of the switches underlying neuronal differentiation. Here we unveiled a widespread and highly dynamic splicing program that affects synaptic genes in cerebellar neurons. The motifs enriched in modulated exons implicated the splicing factor Sam68 as a regulator of this program. Sam68 controls splicing of exons with weak branchpoints by directly binding near the 3' splice site and competing with U2AF recruitment. Ablation of Sam68 disrupts splicing regulation of synaptic genes associated with neurodevelopmental diseases and impairs synaptic connections and firing of Purkinje cells, resulting in motor coordination defects, ataxia, and abnormal social behavior. These findings uncover an unexpectedly dynamic splicing regulatory network that shapes the synapse in early life and establishes motor and cognitive circuitry in the developing cerebellum."	0
"32023473"	"Unexpected Rule-Changes in a Working Memory Task Shape the Firing of Histologically Identified Delay-Tuned Neurons in the Prefrontal Cortex.Working memory-guided behaviors require memory retention during delay periods, when subsets of prefrontal neurons have been reported to exhibit persistently elevated firing. What happens to delay activity when information stored in working memory is no longer relevant for guiding behavior? In this study, we perform juxtacellular recording and labeling of delay-tuned (-elevated or -suppressed) neurons in the prelimbic cortex of freely moving rats, performing a familiar delayed cue-matching-to-place task. Unexpectedly, novel task-rules are introduced, rendering information held in working memory irrelevant. Following successful strategy switching within one session, delay-tuned neurons are filled with neurobiotin for histological analysis. Delay-elevated neurons include pyramidal cells with large heterogeneity of soma-dendritic distribution, molecular expression profiles, and task-relevant activity. Rule change induces heterogenous adjustments on individual neurons and ensembles' activity but cumulates in balanced firing rate reorganizations across cortical layers. Our results demonstrate divergent cellular and network dynamics when an abrupt change in task rules interferes with working memory."	0
"30595437"	"The Translation Inhibitor Rocaglamide Targets a Bimolecular Cavity between eIF4A and Polypurine RNA.A class of translation inhibitors, exemplified by the natural product rocaglamide A (RocA), isolated from Aglaia genus plants, exhibits antitumor activity by clamping eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) onto polypurine sequences in mRNAs. This unusual inhibitory mechanism raises the question of how the drug imposes sequence selectivity onto a general translation factor. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1⋅ATP analog⋅RocA⋅polypurine RNA complex. RocA targets the ""bi-molecular cavity"" formed characteristically by eIF4A1 and a sharply bent pair of consecutive purines in the RNA. Natural amino acid substitutions found in Aglaia eIF4As changed the cavity shape, leading to RocA resistance. This study provides an example of an RNA-sequence-selective interfacial inhibitor fitting into the space shaped cooperatively by protein and RNA with specific sequences."	0
"31522989"	"A Complex of U1 snRNP with Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors Controls Telescripting, Regulating mRNA Transcription in Human Cells.Full-length transcription in the majority of human genes depends on U1 snRNP (U1) to co-transcriptionally suppress transcription-terminating premature 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) from cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in introns. However, the mechanism of this U1 activity, termed telescripting, is unknown. Here, we captured a complex, comprising U1 and CPA factors (U1-CPAFs), that binds intronic PASs and suppresses PCPA. U1-CPAFs are distinct from U1-spliceosomal complexes; they include CPA's three main subunits, CFIm, CPSF, and CstF; lack essential splicing factors; and associate with transcription elongation and mRNA export complexes. Telescripting requires U1:pre-mRNA base-pairing, which can be disrupted by U1 antisense oligonucleotide (U1 AMO), triggering PCPA. U1 AMO remodels U1-CPAFs, revealing changes, including recruitment of CPA-stimulating factors, that explain U1-CPAFs' switch from repressive to activated states. Our findings outline this U1 telescripting mechanism and demonstrate U1's unique role as central regulator of pre-mRNA processing and transcription."	0

Cyclotides have diverse bioactivities, and their cytotoxicity has attracted significant attention for its potential anticancer applications. <i>Hybanthus enneaspermus</i> (Linn) F. Muell is a medicinal herb widely used in India as a libido enhancer, and a previous study has reported that it may contain cyclotides. In the current study, we isolated 11 novel cyclotides and 1 known cyclotide (cycloviolacin O2) from <i>H. enneaspermus</i> and used tandem MS to determine their amino acid sequences. We found that among these cyclotides, hyen C comprises a unique sequence in loops 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 compared with known cyclotides. The most abundant cyclotide in this plant, hyen D, had anticancer activity comparable to that of cycloviolacin O2, one of the most cytotoxic known cyclotides. We also provide mechanistic insights into how these novel cyclotides interact with and permeabilize cell membranes. Results from surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that hyen D, E, L, and M and cycloviolacin O2 preferentially interact with model lipid membranes that contain phospholipids with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine headgroups. The results of a lactate dehydrogenase assay indicated that exposure to these cyclotides compromises cell membrane integrity. Using live-cell imaging, we show that hyen D induces rapid membrane blebbing and cell necrosis. Cyclotide-membrane interactions correlated with the observed cytotoxicity, suggesting that membrane permeabilization and disintegration underpin cyclotide cytotoxicity. These findings broaden our knowledge on the indigenous Indian herb <i>H. enneaspermus</i> and have uncovered cyclotides with potential anticancer activity."	0

Crosstalk between different modifications is poorly understood. Here, we show how acetylation of lysine residues at position 7 of characteristic heptad repeats (K7ac)-only found in higher eukaryotes-regulates phosphorylation of serines at position 5 (S5p), a conserved mark of polymerases initiating transcription. We identified the regulator of pre-mRNA-domain-containing (RPRD) proteins as reader proteins of K7ac. K7ac enhanced CTD peptide binding to the CTD-interacting domain (CID) of RPRD1A and RPRD1B proteins in isothermal calorimetry and molecular modeling experiments. Deacetylase inhibitors increased K7ac- and decreased S5-phosphorylated polymerases, consistent with acetylation-dependent S5 dephosphorylation by an RPRD-associated S5 phosphatase. Consistent with this model, RPRD1B knockdown increased S5p but enhanced K7ac, indicating that RPRD proteins recruit K7 deacetylases, including HDAC1. We also report autoregulatory crosstalk between K7ac and S5p via RPRD proteins and their interactions with acetyl- and phospho-eraser proteins."	0

Here we adapt the concept of RNA dependence, defining a protein as RNA dependent when its interactome depends on RNA. We converted this concept into a proteome-wide, unbiased, and enrichment-free screen called R-DeeP (RNA-dependent proteins), based on density gradient ultracentrifugation. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified 1,784 RNA-dependent proteins, including 537 lacking known links to RNA. Exploiting the quantitative nature of R-DeeP, proteins were classified as not, partially, or completely RNA dependent. R-DeeP identified the transcription factor CTCF as completely RNA dependent, and we uncovered that RNA is required for the CTCF-chromatin association. Additionally, R-DeeP allows reconstruction of protein complexes based on co-segregation. The whole dataset is available at http://R-DeeP.dkfz.de, providing proteome-wide, specific, and quantitative identification of proteins with RNA-dependent interactions and aiming at future functional discovery of RNA-protein complexes."	0

"31474574"	"Disease-Causing Mutations in SF3B1 Alter Splicing by Disrupting Interaction with SUGP1.SF3B1, which encodes an essential spliceosomal protein, is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and many cancers. However, the defect of mutant SF3B1 is unknown. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from MDS patients and confirmed that SF3B1 mutants use aberrant 3' splice sites. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we purified complexes containing either wild-type or the hotspot K700E mutant SF3B1 and found that levels of a poorly studied spliceosomal protein, SUGP1, were reduced in mutant spliceosomes. Strikingly, SUGP1 knockdown completely recapitulated the splicing errors, whereas SUGP1 overexpression drove the protein, which our data suggest plays an important role in branchsite recognition, into the mutant spliceosome and partially rescued splicing. Other hotspot SF3B1 mutants showed similar altered splicing and diminished interaction with SUGP1. Our study demonstrates that SUGP1 loss is a common defect of spliceosomes with disease-causing SF3B1 mutations and, because this defect can be rescued, suggests possibilities for therapeutic intervention."	0
"32610131"	"Senescence, Necrosis, and Apoptosis Govern Circulating Cell-free DNA Release Kinetics.The kinetics of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) release may provide a real-time assessment of induced cell death. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying biological rationale for cfDNA release following distinct treatments and cell death mechanisms. Here, we uncover a complex interplay between apoptosis, necrosis, and senescence in determining cfDNA release kinetics. Utilizing multiple in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we show how cfDNA release is modulated through a combination of apoptotic and senescent triggers and inhibitors. Interestingly, we identify treatment-induced senescence as a previously unrecognized determinant of cfDNA kinetics that can counteract its release. Necrosis is the predominant cell death mechanism that consistently contributes to cfDNA release in response to ionizing radiation, and, surprisingly, apoptosis plays a comparatively minor role in some tumors. Based on our results, we propose a model to explain cfDNA release from cells over time, with important implications for future studies."	0
"30639243"	"BUD13 Promotes a Type I Interferon Response by Countering Intron Retention in Irf7.Intron retention (IR) has emerged as an important mechanism of gene expression control, but the factors controlling IR events remain poorly understood. We observed consistent IR in one intron of the Irf7 gene and identified BUD13 as an RNA-binding protein that acts at this intron to increase the amount of successful splicing. Deficiency in BUD13 was associated with increased IR, decreased mature Irf7 transcript and protein levels, and consequently a dampened type I interferon response, which compromised the ability of BUD13-deficient macrophages to withstand vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Global analysis of BUD13 knockdown and BUD13 cross-linking to RNA revealed a subset of introns that share many characteristics with the one found in Irf7 and are spliced in a BUD13-dependent manner. Deficiency of BUD13 led to decreased mature transcript from genes containing such introns. Thus, by acting as an antagonist to IR, BUD13 facilitates the expression of genes at which IR occurs."	0
"32877671"	"Tp53 Suppression Promotes Cardiomyocyte Proliferation during Zebrafish Heart Regeneration.Zebrafish regenerate heart muscle through division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. To discover underlying regulation, we assess transcriptome datasets for dynamic gene networks during heart regeneration and identify suppression of genes associated with the transcription factor Tp53. Cardiac damage leads to fluctuation of Tp53 protein levels, concomitant with induced expression of its central negative regulator, mdm2, in regenerating cardiomyocytes. Zebrafish lacking functional Tp53 display increased indicators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration, whereas transgenic Mdm2 blockade inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Induced myocardial overexpression of the mitogenic factors Nrg1 or Vegfaa in the absence of injury also upregulates mdm2 and suppresses Tp53 levels, and tp53 mutations augment the mitogenic effects of Nrg1. mdm2 induction is spatiotemporally associated with markers of de-differentiation in injury and growth contexts, suggesting a broad role in cardiogenesis. Our findings reveal myocardial Tp53 suppression by mitogen-induced Mdm2 as a regulatory component of innate cardiac regeneration."	1
"32755578"	"EllipTrack: A Global-Local Cell-Tracking Pipeline for 2D Fluorescence Time-Lapse Microscopy.Time-lapse microscopy provides an unprecedented opportunity to monitor single-cell dynamics. However, tracking cells for long periods remains a technical challenge, especially for multi-day, large-scale movies with rapid cell migration, high cell density, and drug treatments that alter cell morphology/behavior. Here, we present EllipTrack, a global-local cell-tracking pipeline optimized for tracking such movies. EllipTrack first implements a global track-linking algorithm to construct tracks that maximize the probability of cell lineages. Tracking mistakes are then corrected with a local track-correction module in which tracks generated by the global algorithm are systematically examined and amended if a more probable alternative can be found. Through benchmarking, we show that EllipTrack outperforms state-of-the-art cell trackers and generates nearly error-free cell lineages for multiple large-scale movies. In addition, EllipTrack can adapt to time- and cell-density-dependent changes in cell migration speeds and requires minimal training datasets.

"32381627"	"ALS/FTD-associated protein FUS induces mitochondrial dysfunction by preferentially sequestering respiratory chain complex mRNAs.Dysregulation of the DNA/RNA-binding protein FUS causes certain subtypes of ALS/FTD by largely unknown mechanisms. Recent evidence has shown that FUS toxic gain of function due either to mutations or to increased expression can disrupt critical cellular processes, including mitochondrial functions. Here, we demonstrate that in human cells overexpressing wild-type FUS or expressing mutant derivatives, the protein associates with multiple mRNAs, and these are enriched in mRNAs encoding mitochondrial respiratory chain components. Notably, this sequestration leads to reduced levels of the encoded proteins, which is sufficient to bring about disorganized mitochondrial networks, reduced aerobic respiration and increased reactive oxygen species. We further show that mutant FUS associates with mitochondria and with mRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Importantly, similar results were also observed in fibroblasts derived from ALS patients with FUS mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that FUS loss of function does not underlie the observed mitochondrial dysfunction, and also provides a mechanism for the preferential sequestration of the respiratory chain complex mRNAs by FUS that does not involve sequence-specific binding. Together, our data reveal that respiratory chain complex mRNA sequestration underlies the mitochondrial defects characteristic of ALS/FTD and contributes to the FUS toxic gain of function linked to this disease spectrum."	0
"32719008"	"Super-rapid quantitation of the production of HIV-1 harboring a luminescent peptide tag.In studies of HIV-1, virus production is normally monitored by either a reverse transcriptase assay or a p24 antigen capture ELISA. However, these assays are costly and time-consuming for routine handling of a large number of HIV-1 samples. For example, sample dilution is always required in the ELISA procedure to determine p24 protein levels because of the very narrow range of detectable concentrations in this assay. Here, we establish a novel HIV-1 production assay system to solve the aforementioned problems by using a recently developed small peptide tag called HiBiT. This peptide is a fragment of NanoLuc luciferase and generates a strong luminescent signal when complemented with the remaining subunit. To employ this technology, we constructed a novel full-length proviral HIV-1 DNA clone and a lentiviral packaging vector in which the HiBiT tag was added to the C terminus of the integrase. Tagging the integrase with the HiBiT sequence did not impede the resultant virus production, infectivity, or susceptibility to an integrase inhibitor. EM revealed normal morphology of the virus particles. Most importantly, by comparing between ELISA and the HiBiT luciferase assay, we successfully obtained an excellent linear correlation between p24 concentrations and HiBiT-based luciferase activity. Overall, we conclude that HiBiT-tagged viruses can replace the parental HIV-1 and lentiviral vectors, which enables us to perform a super-rapid, inexpensive, convenient, simple, and highly accurate quantitative assay for HIV-1/lentivirus production. This system can be widely applied to a variety of virological studies, along with screening for candidates of future antiviral drugs."	0

B. cenocepacia can survive inside infected macrophages within the B. cenocepacia-containing vacuole (BcCV) and to elicit a severe inflammatory response. By inactivating the host macrophage Rho GTPases, the bacterial effector TecA causes depolymerization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we find that B. cenocepacia induces the formation of large cytosolic F-actin clusters in infected macrophages. Cluster formation requires the nucleation-promoting factor WASH, the Arp2/3 complex, and TecA. Inactivation of Rho GTPases by bacterial toxins is necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of the cytosolic actin clusters. By hijacking WASH and Arp2/3 activity, B. cenocepacia disrupts interactions with the endolysosomal system, thereby delaying the maturation of the BcCV."	0

Whereas many details of Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR structure and function are known, the mechanisms of action of potent inhibitors is not well-understood; elucidating the mechanisms would not only advance drug design strategies but might also provide insights on a terminal electron transfer from riboflavin to UQ. To this end, we performed photoaffinity labeling experiments using photoreactive derivatives of two known inhibitors, aurachin and korormicin, on isolated <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR. The inhibitors labeled the cytoplasmic surface domain of the NqrB subunit including a protruding N-terminal stretch, which may be critical to regulate the UQ reaction in the adjacent NqrA subunit. The labeling was blocked by short-chain UQs such as ubiquinone-2. The photolabile group (2-aryl-5-carboxytetrazole (ACT)) of these inhibitors reacts with nucleophilic amino acids, so we tested mutations of nucleophilic residues in the labeled region of NqrB, such as Asp<sup>49</sup> and Asp<sup>52</sup> (to Ala), and observed moderate decreases in labeling yields, suggesting that these residues are involved in the interaction with ACT. We conclude that the inhibitors interfere with the UQ reaction in two ways: the first is blocking structural rearrangements at the cytoplasmic interface between NqrA and NqrB, and the second is the direct obstruction of UQ binding at this interfacial area. Unusual competitive behavior between the photoreactive inhibitors and various competitors corroborates our previous proposition that there may be two inhibitor binding sites in Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR."	0

The A. baumannii outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer composed of inner leaflet glycerophospholipids and outer leaflet lipooligosaccharides. Deleting mlaF of the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system causes A. baumannii to become more susceptible to pulmonary surfactants and antibiotics and decreases bacterial survival in the lungs of mice. Spontaneous suppressor mutants isolated from infected mice contain an ISAba11 insertion upstream of the ispB initiation codon, an essential isoprenoid biosynthesis gene. The insertion restores antimicrobial resistance and virulence to ΔmlaF. The suppressor strain increases lipooligosaccharides, suggesting that the mechanism involves balancing the glycerophospholipids/lipooligosaccharides ratio on the bacterial surface. An identical insertion exists in an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate, demonstrating its clinical relevance.

"31630970"	"Loss of Dynamic RNA Interaction and Aberrant Phase Separation Induced by Two Distinct Types of ALS/FTD-Linked FUS Mutations.FUS is a nuclear RNA-binding protein, and its cytoplasmic aggregation is a pathogenic signature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It remains unknown how the FUS-RNA interactions contribute to phase separation and whether its phase behavior is affected by ALS-linked mutations. Here we demonstrate that wild-type FUS binds single-stranded RNA stoichiometrically in a length-dependent manner and that multimers induce highly dynamic interactions with RNA, giving rise to small and fluid condensates. In contrast, mutations in arginine display a severely altered conformation, static binding to RNA, and formation of large condensates, signifying the role of arginine in driving proper RNA interaction. Glycine mutations undergo rapid loss of fluidity, emphasizing the role of glycine in promoting fluidity. Strikingly, the nuclear import receptor Karyopherin-β2 reverses the mutant defects and recovers the wild-type FUS behavior.

We report that remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.01 μM). Weaker activity is observed in Vero E6 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.65 μM) because of their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with the chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminishes lung viral load and improves pulmonary function compared with vehicle-treated animals.

However, overcoming MHC barriers is an additional requirement for clinical application of this attractive approach. We demonstrate here that durable tolerance toward mis-matched lung progenitors and their derivatives can be achieved without any chronic immune suppression, by virtue of co-transplantation with hematopoietic progenitors from the same donor. Initial proof of concept of this approach was attained by transplantation of fetal lung cells comprising both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic progenitors.

These results lay the foundation for repair of lung injury through a procedure akin to bone marrow transplantation."	0
"32101734"	"Predicting Successful Generation and Inhibition of Seizure-like Afterdischarges and Mapping Their Seizure Networks Using fMRI.To understand the conditions necessary to initiate and terminate seizures, we investigate optogenetically induced hippocampal seizures with LFP, fMRI, and optogenetic inhibition. During afterdischarge induction using optogenetics, LFP recordings show that stimulations with earlier ictal onset times are more likely to result in afterdischarges and are more difficult to curtail with optogenetic inhibition. These results are generalizable across two initiation sites, the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. fMRI shows that afterdischarges initiated from the dorsal or ventral hippocampus exhibit distinct networks. Short-duration seizures initiated in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus are unilateral and bilateral, respectively, while longer-duration afterdischarges recruit broader, bilateral networks. When optogenetic inhibition is ineffective at stopping seizures, the network activity spreads more extensively but largely overlaps with the network activity associated with seizures that could be curtailed. These results provide insights into how seizures can be inhibited, which has implications for targeted seizure interventions."	0
"32402275"	"Maternal Anti-Dengue IgG Fucosylation Predicts Susceptibility to Dengue Disease in Infants.Infant mortality from dengue disease is a devastating global health burden that could be minimized with the ability to identify susceptibility for severe disease prior to infection. Although most primary infant dengue infections are asymptomatic, maternally derived anti-dengue immunoglobulin G (IgGs) present during infection can trigger progression to severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement mechanisms. Importantly, specific characteristics of maternal IgGs that herald progression to severe infant dengue are unknown. Here, we define ≥10% afucosylation of maternal anti-dengue IgGs as a risk factor for susceptibility of infants to symptomatic dengue infections. Mechanistic experiments show that afucosylation of anti-dengue IgGs promotes FcγRIIIa signaling during infection, in turn enhancing dengue virus replication in FcγRIIIa<sup>+</sup> monocytes. These studies identify a post-translational modification of anti-dengue IgGs that correlates with risk for symptomatic infant dengue infections and define a mechanism by which afucosylated antibodies and FcγRIIIa enhance dengue infections."	0
"32299913"	"The SHCA adapter protein cooperates with lipoma-preferred partner in the regulation of adhesion dynamics and invadopodia formation.SHC adaptor protein (SHCA) and lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) mediate transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Reduced expression of either protein diminishes breast cancer lung metastasis, but the reason for this effect is unclear. Here, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that TGFβ enhanced the assembly and disassembly rates of paxillin-containing adhesions in an SHCA-dependent manner through the phosphorylation of the specific SHCA tyrosine residues Tyr-239, Tyr-240, and Tyr-313. Using a BioID proximity labeling approach, we show that SHCA exists in a complex with a variety of actin cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin and LPP. Consistent with a functional interaction between SHCA and LPP, TGFβ-induced LPP localization to cellular adhesions depended on SHCA. Once localized to the adhesions, LPP was required for TGFβ-induced increases in cell migration and adhesion dynamics. Mutations that impaired LPP localization to adhesions (mLIM1) or impeded interactions with the actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin (ΔABD) abrogated migratory responses to TGFβ. Live-cell TIRF microscopy revealed that SHCA clustering at the cell membrane preceded LPP recruitment. We therefore hypothesize that, in the presence of TGFβ, SHCA promotes the formation of small, dynamic adhesions by acting as a nucleator of focal complex formation. Finally, we defined a previously unknown function for SHCA in the formation of invadopodia, a process that also required LPP. Our results reveal that SHCA controls the formation and function of adhesions and invadopodia, two key cellular structures required for breast cancer metastasis."	0

"32697998"	"A Synthetic Likelihood Solution to the Silent Synapse Estimation Problem.Functional features of synaptic populations are typically inferred from random electrophysiological sampling of small subsets of synapses. Are these samples unbiased? Here, we develop a biophysically constrained statistical framework to address this question and apply it to assess the performance of a widely used method based on a failure-rate analysis to quantify the occurrence of silent (AMPAR-lacking) synapses. We simulate this method in silico and find that it is characterized by strong and systematic biases, poor reliability, and weak statistical power. Key conclusions are validated by whole-cell recordings from hippocampal neurons. To address these shortcomings, we develop a simulator of the experimental protocol and use it to compute a synthetic likelihood. By maximizing the likelihood, we infer silent synapse fraction with no bias, low variance, and superior statistical power over alternatives. Together, this generalizable approach highlights how a simulator of experimental methodologies can substantially improve the estimation of physiological properties."	0

Here, we reveal the reactions that account for channeling in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis phase of the Arabidopsis RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. The process begins with template DNA transcription by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV), whose atypical termination mechanism, induced by nontemplate DNA base-pairing, channels transcripts to the associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2. RDR2 converts Pol IV transcripts into double-stranded RNAs and then typically adds an extra untemplated 3' terminal nucleotide to the second strands. The dicer endonuclease DCL3 cuts resulting duplexes to generate 24- and 23-nt siRNAs. The 23-nt RNAs bear the untemplated terminal nucleotide of the RDR2 strand and are underrepresented among ARGONAUTE4-associated siRNAs. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into Pol IV termination, Pol IV-RDR2 coupling, and RNA channeling, from template DNA transcription to siRNA strand discrimination."	0

Pathogenic variants in the essential gene <i>BRCA2/FANCD1,</i> when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 function in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 recombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and RAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has been shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant nuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. Here, based on the analysis of <i>BRCA2</i> DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants (c.8488-1G>A and c.8524C>T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical FA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of DNA at ICLs. Cells carrying <i>BRCA2</i> DBD mutations are sensitive to ICL-inducing agents but resistant to HU treatment consistent with relatively high HR repair in these cells. BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN nuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the resection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate that unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 translocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not an integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of fork protection at different DNA lesions."	0
"32433968"	"ATF4-Induced Warburg Metabolism Drives Over-Proliferation in Drosophila.The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enables essential metabolic reactions; nonetheless, the cellular responses to defects in mitochondria and the modulation of signaling pathway outputs are not understood. We show that Notch signaling and ETC attenuation via knockdown of COX7a induces massive over-proliferation. The tumor-like growth is caused by a transcriptional response through the eIF2α-kinase PERK and ATF4, which activates the expression of metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters, and mitochondrial chaperones. We find this stress adaptation to be beneficial for progenitor cell fitness, as it renders cells sensitive to proliferation induced by the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, over-proliferation is not caused by transcriptional cooperation of Notch and ATF4, but it is mediated in part by pH changes resulting from the Warburg metabolism induced by ETC attenuation. Our results suggest that ETC function is monitored by the PERK-ATF4 pathway, which can be hijacked by growth-promoting signaling pathways, leading to oncogenic pathway activity."	0
"32675324"	"Comparison of tumor-associated YAP1 fusions identifies a recurrent set of functions critical for oncogenesis.YAP1 is a transcriptional coactivator and the principal effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is causally implicated in human cancer. Several <i>YAP1</i> gene fusions have been identified in various human cancers and identifying the essential components of this family of gene fusions has significant therapeutic value. Here, we show that the <i>YAP1</i> gene fusions <i>YAP1-MAMLD1</i>, <i>YAP1-FAM118B</i>, <i>YAP1-TFE3</i>, and <i>YAP1-SS18</i> are oncogenic in mice. Using reporter assays, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and loss-of-function mutations, we can show that all of these YAP1 fusion proteins exert TEAD-dependent YAP activity, while some also exert activity of the C'-terminal fusion partner. The YAP activity of the different YAP1 fusions is resistant to negative Hippo pathway regulation due to constitutive nuclear localization and resistance to degradation of the YAP1 fusion proteins. Genetic disruption of the TEAD-binding domain of these oncogenic YAP1 fusions is sufficient to inhibit tumor formation in vivo, while pharmacological inhibition of the YAP1-TEAD interaction inhibits the growth of YAP1 fusion-expressing cell lines in vitro. These results highlight TEAD-dependent YAP activity found in these gene fusions as critical for oncogenesis and implicate these YAP functions as potential therapeutic targets in YAP1 fusion-positive tumors."	0
"32130910"	"Direct Comparison of Mononucleated and Binucleated Cardiomyocytes Reveals Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Distinct Proliferative Competencies.The mammalian heart is incapable of regenerating a sufficient number of cardiomyocytes to ameliorate the loss of contractile muscle after acute myocardial injury. Several reports have demonstrated that mononucleated cardiomyocytes are more responsive than are binucleated cardiomyocytes to pro-proliferative stimuli. We have developed a strategy to isolate and characterize highly enriched populations of mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes at various times of development. Our results suggest that an E2f/Rb transcriptional network is central to the divergence of these two populations and that remnants of the differences acquired during the neonatal period remain in adult cardiomyocytes. Moreover, inducing binucleation by genetically blocking the ability of cardiomyocytes to complete cytokinesis leads to a reduction in E2f target gene expression, directly linking the E2f pathway with nucleation. These data identify key molecular differences between mononucleated and binucleated mammalian cardiomyocytes that can be used to leverage cardiomyocyte proliferation for promoting injury repair in the heart."	0
"31995766"	"Circuit Integration Initiation of New Hippocampal Neurons in the Adult Brain.In the adult brain, new dentate granule cells integrate into neural circuits and participate in hippocampal functioning. However, when and how they initiate this integration remain poorly understood. Using retroviral and live-imaging methods, we find that new neurons undergo neurite remodeling for competitive horizontal-to-radial repositioning in the dentate gyrus prior to circuit integration. Gene expression profiling, lipidomics analysis, and molecular interrogation of new neurons during this period reveal a rapid activation of sphingolipid signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1. Genetic manipulation of this G protein-coupled receptor reveals its requirement for successful repositioning of new neurons. This receptor is also activated by hippocampus-engaged behaviors, which enhances repositioning efficiency. These findings reveal that activity-dependent sphingolipid signaling regulates cellular repositioning of new dentate granule cells. The competitive horizontal-to-radial repositioning of new neurons may provide a gating strategy in the adult brain to limit the integration of new neurons into pre-existing circuits."	0
"32433972"	"Predicting mRNA Abundance Directly from Genomic Sequence Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field."	0

"32619469"	"Pharmaceutical-Grade Rigosertib Is a Microtubule-Destabilizing Agent.We recently used CRISPRi/a-based chemical-genetic screens and cell biological, biochemical, and structural assays to determine that rigosertib, an anti-cancer agent in phase III clinical trials, kills cancer cells by destabilizing microtubules. Reddy and co-workers (Baker et al., 2020, this issue of Molecular Cell) suggest that a contaminating degradation product in commercial formulations of rigosertib is responsible for the microtubule-destabilizing activity. Here, we demonstrate that cells treated with pharmaceutical-grade rigosertib (>99.9% purity) or commercially obtained rigosertib have qualitatively indistinguishable phenotypes across multiple assays. The two formulations have indistinguishable chemical-genetic interactions with genes that modulate microtubule stability, both destabilize microtubules in cells and in vitro, and expression of a rationally designed tubulin mutant with a mutation in the rigosertib binding site (L240F TUBB) allows cells to proliferate in the presence of either formulation. Importantly, the specificity of the L240F TUBB mutant for microtubule-destabilizing agents has been confirmed independently. Thus, rigosertib kills cancer cells by destabilizing microtubules, in agreement with our original findings."	0
"31940484"	"Specific Ion Channels Control Sensory Gain, Sensitivity, and Kinetics in a Tonic Thermonociceptor.Pain sensation and aversive behaviors entail the activation of nociceptor neurons, whose function is largely conserved across animals. The functional heterogeneity of nociceptors and ethical concerns are challenges for their study in mammalian models. Here, we investigate the function of a single type of genetically identified C. elegans thermonociceptor named FLP. Using calcium imaging in vivo, we demonstrate that FLP encodes thermal information in a tonic and graded manner over a wide thermal range spanning from noxious cold to noxious heat (8°C-36°C). This tonic-signaling mode allows FLP to trigger sustained behavioral changes necessary for escape behavior. Furthermore, we identify specific transient receptor potential, voltage-gated calcium, and sodium ""leak"" channels controlling sensory gain, thermal sensitivity, and signal kinetics, respectively, and show that the ryanodine receptor is required for long-lasting activation. Our work elucidates the task distribution among specific ion channels to achieve remarkable sensory properties in a tonic thermonociceptor in vivo."	0
"32105612"	"Lamina-Dependent Stretching and Unconventional Chromosome Compartments in Early C. elegans Embryos.Current models suggest that chromosome domains segregate into either an active (A) or inactive (B) compartment. B-compartment chromatin is physically separated from the A compartment and compacted by the nuclear lamina. To examine these models in the developmental context of C. elegans embryogenesis, we undertook chromosome tracing to map the trajectories of entire autosomes. Early embryonic chromosomes organized into an unconventional barbell-like configuration, with two densely folded B compartments separated by a central A compartment. Upon gastrulation, this conformation matured into conventional A/B compartments. We used unsupervised clustering to uncover subpopulations with differing folding properties and variable positioning of compartment boundaries. These conformations relied on tethering to the lamina to stretch the chromosome; detachment from the lamina compacted, and allowed intermingling between, A/B compartments. These findings reveal the diverse conformations of early embryonic chromosomes and uncover a previously unappreciated role for the lamina in systemic chromosome stretching."	0
"32697994"	"Structural Insights into the SPRED1-Neurofibromin-KRAS Complex and Disruption of SPRED1-Neurofibromin Interaction by Oncogenic EGFR.Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing (SPRED) proteins negatively regulate RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling following growth factor stimulation. This inhibition of RAS is thought to occur primarily through SPRED1 binding and recruitment of neurofibromin, a RasGAP, to the plasma membrane. Here, we report the structure of neurofibromin (GTPase-activating protein [GAP]-related domain) complexed with SPRED1 (EVH1 domain) and KRAS. The structure provides insight into how the membrane targeting of neurofibromin by SPRED1 allows simultaneous interaction with activated KRAS. SPRED1 and NF1 loss-of-function mutations occur across multiple cancer types and developmental diseases. Analysis of the neurofibromin-SPRED1 interface provides a rationale for mutations observed in Legius syndrome and suggests why SPRED1 can bind to neurofibromin but no other RasGAPs. We show that oncogenic EGFR(L858R) signaling leads to the phosphorylation of SPRED1 on serine 105, disrupting the SPRED1-neurofibromin complex. The structural, biochemical, and biological results provide new mechanistic insights about how SPRED1 interacts with neurofibromin and regulates active KRAS levels in normal and pathologic conditions."	0
"30898439"	"Inheritance of a Phenotypically Neutral Epimutation Evokes Gene Silencing in Later Generations.Small RNAs trigger the formation of epialleles that are silenced across generations. Consequently, RNA-directed epimutagenesis is associated with persistent gene repression. Here, we demonstrate that small interfering RNA-induced epimutations in fission yeast are still inherited even when the silenced gene is reactivated, and descendants can reinstate the silencing phenotype that only occurred in their ancestors. This process is mediated by the deposition of a phenotypically neutral molecular mark composed of tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3). Its stable propagation is coupled to RNAi and requires maximal binding affinity of the Clr4/Suvar39 chromodomain to H3K9me3. In wild-type cells, this mark has no visible impact on transcription but causes gene silencing if RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) activity is impaired. In sum, our results reveal a distinct form of epigenetic memory in which cells acquire heritable, transcriptionally active epialleles that confer gene silencing upon modulation of Paf1C."	0
"32610127"	"The AP1 Transcription Factor Fosl2 Promotes Systemic Autoimmunity and Inflammation by Repressing Treg Development.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a major population in the control of immune homeostasis and autoimmunity. Here we show that Fos-like 2 (Fosl2), a TCR-induced AP1 transcription factor, represses Treg development and controls autoimmunity. Mice overexpressing Fosl2 (Fosl2<sup>tg</sup>) indeed show a systemic inflammatory phenotype, with immune infiltrates in multiple organs. This phenotype is absent in Fosl2<sup>tg</sup> × Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice lacking T and B cells, and Fosl2 induces T cell-intrinsic reduction of Treg development that is responsible for the inflammatory phenotype. Fosl2<sup>tg</sup> T cells can transfer inflammation, which is suppressed by the co-delivery of Tregs, while Fosl2 deficiency in T cells reduces the severity of autoimmunity in the EAE model. We find that Fosl2 could affect expression of FoxP3 and other Treg development genes. Our data highlight the importance of AP1 transcription factors, in particular Fosl2, during T cell development to determine Treg differentiation and control autoimmunity."	0
"31968248"	"Remodeling of Metastatic Vasculature Reduces Lung Colonization and Sensitizes Overt Metastases to Immunotherapy.Due to limited current therapies, metastases are the primary cause of mortality in cancer patients. Here, we employ a fusion compound of the cytokine LIGHT and a vascular targeting peptide (LIGHT-VTP) that homes to angiogenic blood vessels in primary tumors. We show in primary mouse lung cancer that normalization of tumor vasculature by LIGHT-VTP prevents cancer cell intravasation. Further, LIGHT-VTP efficiently targets pathological blood vessels in the pre-metastatic niche, reducing vascular hyper-permeability and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thus blocking metastatic lung colonization. Moreover, we demonstrate that mouse and human metastatic melanoma deposits are targetable by VTP. In overt melanoma metastases, LIGHT-VTP normalizes intra-metastatic blood vessels and increases GrzB<sup>+</sup> effector T cells. Successful treatment induces high endothelial venules (HEVs) and lymphocyte clusters, which sensitize refractory lung metastases to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. These findings demonstrate an important application for LIGHT-VTP therapy in preventing metastatic development as well as exerting anti-tumor effects in established metastases."	0
"32213324"	"Ultrastructural Details of Mammalian Chromosome Architecture.Over the past decade, 3C-related methods have provided remarkable insights into chromosome folding in vivo. To overcome the limited resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed Hi-C variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human ESCs and fibroblasts. Micro-C robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable resource for studies of chromosome organization."	0
"32580944"	"Negatively charged amino acids in the stalk region of membrane proteins reduce ectodomain shedding.Ectodomain shedding is a post-translational modification mechanism by which the entire extracellular domain of membrane proteins is liberated through juxtamembrane processing. Because shedding rapidly and irreversibly alters the characteristics of cells, this process is properly regulated. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the propensity of membrane proteins to shedding are largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that negatively charged amino acids within the stalk region, an unstructured juxtamembrane region at which shedding occurs, contribute to shedding susceptibility. We show that two <u>a</u>ctivated <u>leukocyte c</u>ell <u>a</u>dhesion <u>m</u>olecule (ALCAM) protein variants produced by alternative splicing have different susceptibilities to ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated shedding. Of note, the inclusion of a stalk region encoded by a 39-bp-long alternative exon conferred shedding resistance. We found that this alternative exon encodes a large proportion of negatively charged amino acids, which we demonstrate are indispensable for conferring the shedding resistance. We also show that the introduction of negatively charged amino acids into the stalk region of shedding-susceptible ALCAM variant protein attenuates its shedding. Furthermore, we observed that negatively charged amino acids residing in the stalk region of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) are indispensable for its shedding resistance. Collectively, our results indicate that negatively charged amino acids within the stalk region interfere with the shedding of multiple membrane proteins. We conclude that the composition of the stalk region determines the shedding susceptibility of membrane proteins."	0

"32641494"	"Modulation of Kv4.2/KChIP3 interaction by the ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 protein CLN3.Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels of the Kv4 subfamily associate with Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs), which leads to enhanced surface expression and shapes the inactivation gating of these channels. KChIP3 has been reported to also interact with the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3 (ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3), which is modified because of gene mutation in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL). The present study was undertaken to find out whether and how CLN3, by its interaction with KChIP3, may indirectly modulate Kv4.2 channel expression and function. To this end, we expressed KChIP3 and CLN3, either individually or simultaneously, together with Kv4.2 in HEK 293 cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found a lower amount of KChIP3 bound to Kv4.2 in the presence of CLN3. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, we examined the effects of CLN3 co-expression on the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels. Simultaneous co-expression of CLN3 and KChIP3 with Kv4.2 resulted in a suppression of the typical KChIP3-mediated modulation; <i>i.e.</i> we observed less increase in current density, less slowing of macroscopic current decay, less acceleration of recovery from inactivation, and a less positively shifted voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. The suppression of the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels was weaker for the JNCL-related missense mutant CLN3<sub>R334C</sub> and for a JNCL-related C-terminal deletion mutant (CLN3ΔC). Our data support the notion that CLN3 is involved in Kv4.2/KChIP3 somatodendritic A-type channel formation, trafficking, and function, a feature that may be lost in JNCL."	0
"31919192"	"Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 degradation regulates kinetochore composition in meiosis.The kinetochore complex is a conserved machinery that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules. During meiosis, the kinetochore is restructured to accommodate a specialized chromosome segregation pattern. In budding yeast, meiotic kinetochore remodeling is mediated by the temporal changes in the abundance of a single subunit called Ndc80. We previously described the regulatory events that control the timely synthesis of Ndc80. Here, we report that Ndc80 turnover is also tightly regulated in meiosis: Ndc80 degradation is active in meiotic prophase, but not in metaphase I. Ndc80 degradation depends on the ubiquitin ligase APC<sup>Ama1</sup> and is mediated by the proteasome. Importantly, Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation, a mark that has been previously implicated in correcting erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, is essential for Ndc80 degradation in a microtubule-independent manner. The N terminus of Ndc80, including a 27-residue sequence and Aurora B phosphorylation sites, is both necessary and sufficient for kinetochore protein degradation. Finally, defects in Ndc80 turnover predispose meiotic cells to chromosome mis-segregation. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which meiotic cells modulate their kinetochore composition through regulated Ndc80 degradation, and demonstrates that Aurora B-dependent regulation of kinetochores extends beyond altering microtubule attachments."	1
"31201089"	"Sister DNA Entrapment between Juxtaposed Smc Heads and Kleisin of the Cohesin Complex.Cohesin entraps sister DNAs within tripartite rings created by pairwise interactions between Smc1, Smc3, and Scc1. Because Smc1/3 ATPase heads can also interact with each other, cohesin rings have the potential to form a variety of sub-compartments. Using in vivo cysteine cross-linking, we show that when Smc1 and Smc3 ATPases are engaged in the presence of ATP (E heads), cohesin rings generate a ""SMC (S) compartment"" between hinge and E heads and a ""kleisin (K) compartment"" between E heads and their associated kleisin subunit. Upon ATP hydrolysis, cohesin's heads associate in a different mode, in which their signature motifs and their coiled coils are closely juxtaposed (J heads), creating alternative S and K compartments. We show that K compartments of either E or J type can entrap single DNAs, that acetylation of Smc3 during S phase is associated with J heads, and that sister DNAs are entrapped in J-K compartments."	0

Resection tracts averaged 1100 nt, but with substantial fine-scale heterogeneity at individual hot spots. Surprisingly, EXO1 is not the major 5' → 3' exonuclease, but the DSB-responsive kinase ATM proved a key regulator of both initiation and extension of resection. In wild type, apparent intermolecular recombination intermediates clustered near to but offset from DSB positions, consistent with joint molecules with incompletely invaded 3' ends.

"31973889"	"PIKES Analysis Reveals Response to Degraders and Key Regulatory Mechanisms of the CRL4 Network.Co-opting Cullin4 RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s) to inducibly degrade pathogenic proteins is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. Despite intense efforts to rationally design degrader molecules that co-opt CRL4s, much about the organization and regulation of these ligases remains elusive. Here, we establish protein interaction kinetics and estimation of stoichiometries (PIKES) analysis, a systematic proteomic profiling platform that integrates cellular engineering, affinity purification, chemical stabilization, and quantitative mass spectrometry to investigate the dynamics of interchangeable multiprotein complexes. Using PIKES, we show that ligase assemblies of Cullin4 with individual substrate receptors differ in abundance by up to 200-fold and that Cand1/2 act as substrate receptor exchange factors. Furthermore, degrader molecules can induce the assembly of their cognate CRL4, and higher expression of the associated substrate receptor enhances degrader potency.

Although Manaus is a key demographic hub in the Amazon region, little is known about the ZIKV epidemic there, in terms of both transmission and viral genetic diversity. Using portable virus genome sequencing, we generated 59 ZIKV genomes in Manaus. Phylogenetic analyses indicated multiple introductions of ZIKV from northeastern Brazil to Manaus. Spatial genomic analysis of virus movement among six areas in Manaus suggested that populous northern neighborhoods acted as sources of virus transmission to other neighborhoods.

"32460020"	"A Neurotrophic Mechanism Directs Sensory Nerve Transit in Cranial Bone.The flat bones of the skull are densely innervated during development, but little is known regarding their role during repair. We describe a neurotrophic mechanism that directs sensory nerve transit in the mouse calvaria. Patent cranial suture mesenchyme represents an NGF (nerve growth factor)-rich domain, in which sensory nerves transit. Experimental calvarial injury upregulates Ngf in an IL-1β/TNF-α-rich defect niche, with consequent axonal ingrowth. In calvarial osteoblasts, IL-1β and TNF-α stimulate Ngf and downstream NF-κB signaling. Locoregional deletion of Ngf delays defect site re-innervation and blunted repair. Genetic disruption of Ngf among LysM-expressing macrophages phenocopies these observations, whereas conditional knockout of Ngf among Pdgfra-expressing cells does not. Finally, inhibition of TrkA catalytic activity similarly delays re-innervation and repair. These results demonstrate an essential role of NGF-TrkA signaling in bone healing and implicate macrophage-derived NGF-induced ingrowth of skeletal sensory nerves as an important mediator of this repair."	0
"32541879"	"Neural metabolic imbalance induced by MOF dysfunction triggers pericyte activation and breakdown of vasculature.Mutations in chromatin-modifying complexes and metabolic enzymes commonly underlie complex human developmental syndromes affecting multiple organs. A major challenge is to determine how disease-causing genetic lesions cause deregulation of homeostasis in unique cell types. Here we show that neural-specific depletion of three members of the non-specific lethal (NSL) chromatin complex-Mof, Kansl2 or Kansl3-unexpectedly leads to severe vascular defects and brain haemorrhaging. Deregulation of the epigenetic landscape induced by the loss of the NSL complex in neural cells causes widespread metabolic defects, including an accumulation of free long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Free LCFAs induce a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory signalling cascade in neighbouring vascular pericytes that is rescued by TLR4 inhibition. Pericytes display functional changes in response to LCFA-induced activation that result in vascular breakdown.

We find an excess of heterozygotes carrying the rare allele of SNP rs140124801 in KCNG4. The rare variant K<sub>V</sub>6.4-Met419 has a dominant-negative effect and cannot modulate the voltage dependence of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 inactivation because it fails to traffic to the plasma membrane.

"32698010"	"mTORC1 Signaling Controls TLR2-Mediated T-Cell Activation by Inducing TIRAP Expression.Effector, but not naïve, T cells are activated by toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) stimulation, leading to cytokine production and proliferation. We found that the differential response is attributable to the lack of expression of the adaptor protein TIRAP in naive T cells. TIRAP expression is induced upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and sustained by strong interleukin-2 (IL-2) signals. Expression of TIRAP requires TCR- and IL-2-induced mTORC1 activation. TLR2 stimulation induced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and ERK, leading to much higher production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by T helper 1 (Th1) cells cultured in a high concentration of IL-2 than by those cultured in a low concentration of IL-2. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation induces mTORC1 activation through TIRAP, which is essential for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production. These data demonstrate that the mTORC1 signal confers the response to TLR2 signaling by inducing TIRAP expression and that the TIRAP-mTORC1 axis is critical for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production by effector T cells."	1
"30503775"	"Widespread Backtracking by RNA Pol II Is a Major Effector of Gene Activation, 5' Pause Release, Termination, and Transcription Elongation Rate.In addition to phosphodiester bond formation, RNA polymerase II has an RNA endonuclease activity, stimulated by TFIIS, which rescues complexes that have arrested and backtracked. How TFIIS affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIIS<sub>DN</sub>) that inhibits RNA cleavage and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow elongation early in transcription, and in 3' flanking regions where termination is enhanced by TFIIS<sub>DN</sub>, suggesting that backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination. Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes. TFIIS<sub>DN</sub> slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of elongation under normal conditions."	0
"32483387"	"Chromosomal translocation-derived aberrant Rab22a drives metastasis of osteosarcoma.Osteosarcoma is a type of aggressive malignant bone tumour that frequently metastasizes to lungs, resulting in poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of lung metastasis of osteosarcoma remain poorly understood. Here we identify exon-intron fusion genes in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. These fusion genes are derived from chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the coding region for amino acids 1-38 of Rab22a (Rab22a<sup>1-38</sup>) with multiple inverted introns and untranslated regions of chromosome 20. The resulting translation products, designated Rab22a-NeoFs, acquire the ability to drive lung metastasis of osteosarcoma. The Rab22a<sup>1-38</sup> moiety governs the function of Rab22a-NeoFs by binding to SmgGDS-607, a GTP-GDP exchange factor of RhoA. This association facilitates the release of GTP-bound RhoA from SmgGDS-607, which induces increased activity of RhoA and promotes metastasis. Disrupting the interaction between Rab22a-NeoF1 and SmgGDS-607 with a synthetic peptide prevents lung metastasis in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma. Our findings may provide a promising strategy for a subset of osteosarcoma patients with lung metastases."	0
"32877665"	"Single-Cell Information Analysis Reveals That Skeletal Muscles Incorporate Cell-to-Cell Variability as Information Not Noise.Cell-to-cell variability in signal transduction in biological systems is often considered noise. However, intercellular variation (i.e., cell-to-cell variability) has the potential to enable individual cells to encode different information. Here, we show that intercellular variation increases information transmission of skeletal muscle. We analyze the responses of multiple cultured myotubes or isolated skeletal muscle fibers as a multiple-cell channel composed of single-cell channels. We find that the multiple-cell channel, which incorporates intercellular variation as information, not noise, transmitted more information in the presence of intercellular variation than in the absence according to the ""response diversity effect,"" increasing in the gradualness of dose response by summing the cell-to-cell variable dose responses. We quantify the information transmission of human facial muscle contraction during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and find that information transmission of muscle contraction is comparable to that of a multiple-cell channel. Thus, our data indicate that intercellular variation can increase the information capacity of tissues."	0
"32647012"	"PCBP1 and PCBP2 both bind heavily oxidized RNA but cause opposing outcomes, suppressing or increasing apoptosis under oxidative conditions.PCBP1, a member of the poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP) family, has the capability of binding heavily oxidized RNA and therefore participates in the cellular response to oxidative conditions, helping to induce apoptosis. There are four other members of this family, PCBP2, PCBP3, PCBP4, and hnRNPK, but it is not known whether they play similar roles. To learn more, we first tested their affinity for an RNA strand carrying two 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) residues at sites located in close proximity to each other, representative of a heavily oxidized strand or RNA with one 8-oxoG or none. Among them, only PCBP2 exhibited highly selective binding to RNA carrying two 8-oxoG residues similar to that observed with PCBP1. In contrast, PCBP3, PCBP4, and hnRNPK bound RNA with or without 8-oxoG modifications and exhibited slightly increased binding to the former. Mutations in conserved RNA-binding domains of PCBP2 disrupted the specific interaction with heavily oxidized RNA. We next tested PCBP2 activity in cells. Compared with WT HeLa S3 cells, PCBP2-KO cells established by gene editing exhibited increased apoptosis with increased caspase-3 activity and PARP1 cleavage under oxidative conditions, which were suppressed by the expression of WT PCBP2 but not one of the mutants lacking binding activity. In contrast, PCBP1-KO cells exhibited reduced apoptosis with much less caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage than WT cells. Our results indicate that PCBP2 as well as PCBP1 bind heavily oxidized RNA; however, the former may counteract PCBP1 to suppress apoptosis under oxidative conditions."	0

"32661196"	"Crystallographic snapshots of UDP-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase ligand binding, rotation, and reduction.UDP-glucuronic acid is converted to UDP-galacturonic acid en route to a variety of sugar-containing metabolites. This reaction is performed by a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent epimerase belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. We present several high-resolution crystal structures of the UDP-glucuronic acid epimerase from <i>Bacillus cereus</i> The geometry of the substrate-NAD<sup>+</sup> interactions is finely arranged to promote hydride transfer. The exquisite complementarity between glucuronic acid and its binding site is highlighted by the observation that the unligated cavity is occupied by a cluster of ordered waters whose positions overlap the polar groups of the sugar substrate. Co-crystallization experiments led to a structure where substrate- and product-bound enzymes coexist within the same crystal. This equilibrium structure reveals the basis for a ""swing and flip"" rotation of the pro-chiral 4-keto-hexose-uronic acid intermediate that results from glucuronic acid oxidation, placing the C4' atom in position for receiving a hydride ion on the opposite side of the sugar ring. The product-bound active site is almost identical to that of the substrate-bound structure and satisfies all hydrogen-bonding requirements of the ligand. The structure of the apoenzyme together with the kinetic isotope effect and mutagenesis experiments further outlines a few flexible loops that exist in discrete conformations, imparting structural malleability required for ligand rotation while avoiding leakage of the catalytic intermediate and/or side reactions. These data highlight the double nature of the enzymatic mechanism: the active site features a high degree of precision in substrate recognition combined with the flexibility required for intermediate rotation."	0
"31519521"	"SUMO-Chain-Regulated Proteasomal Degradation Timing Exemplified in DNA Replication Initiation.Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO forms chains, but the identity of SUMO-chain-modified factors and the purpose of this modification remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the budding yeast SUMO protease Ulp2, able to disassemble SUMO chains, as a DDK interactor enriched at replication origins that promotes DNA replication initiation. Replication-engaged DDK is SUMOylated on chromatin, becoming a degradation-prone substrate when Ulp2 no longer protects it against SUMO chain assembly. Specifically, SUMO chains channel DDK for SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5/Slx8-mediated and Cdc48 segregase-assisted proteasomal degradation. Importantly, the SUMOylation-defective ddk-KR mutant rescues inefficient replication onset and MCM activation in cells lacking Ulp2, suggesting that SUMO chains time DDK degradation. Using two unbiased proteomic approaches, we further identify subunits of the MCM helicase and other factors as SUMO-chain-modified degradation-prone substrates of Ulp2 and Slx5/Slx8. We thus propose SUMO-chain/Ulp2-protease-regulated proteasomal degradation as a mechanism that times the availability of functionally engaged SUMO-modified protein pools during replication and beyond."	1
"32049007"	"Phenformin Inhibits Hedgehog-Dependent Tumor Growth through a Complex I-Independent Redox/Corepressor Module.The antidiabetic drug phenformin displays potent anticancer activity in different tumors, but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Using Shh medulloblastoma as model, we show here that at clinically relevant concentrations, phenformin elicits a significant therapeutic effect through a redox-dependent but complex I-independent mechanism. Phenformin inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), a component of the glycerophosphate shuttle, and causes elevations of intracellular NADH content. Inhibition of mGPD mimics phenformin action and promotes an association between corepressor CtBP2 and Gli1, thereby inhibiting Hh transcriptional output and tumor growth. Because ablation of CtBP2 abrogates the therapeutic effect of phenformin in mice, these data illustrate a biguanide-mediated redox/corepressor interplay, which may represent a relevant target for tumor therapy."	1
"32402280"	"Actin Assembly around the Shigella-Containing Vacuole Promotes Successful Infection.The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri forces its uptake into non-phagocytic host cells through the translocation of T3SS effectors that subvert the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we report de novo actin polymerization after cellular entry around the bacterium-containing vacuole (BCV) leading to the formation of a dynamic actin cocoon. This cocoon is thicker than any described cellular actin structure and functions as a gatekeeper for the cytosolic access of the pathogen. Host CDC42, TOCA-1, N-WASP, WIP, the Arp2/3 complex, cortactin, coronin, and cofilin are recruited to the actin cocoon. They are subverted by T3SS effectors, such as IpgD, IpgB1, and IcsB. IcsB immobilizes components of the actin polymerization machinery at the BCV dependent on its fatty acyltransferase activity. This represents a unique microbial subversion strategy through localized entrapment of host actin regulators causing massive actin assembly. We propose that the cocoon promotes subsequent invasion steps for successful Shigella infection."	0

Surprisingly, the high-threshold target gene <i>snail</i> only requires Dorsal input early but not late when Dorsal levels peak. Instead, late <i>snail</i> expression can be supported by action of the Twist transcription factor, specifically, through one enhancer, <i>sna.distal</i> This study demonstrates that continuous input is not required for some Dorsal targets and downstream responses, such as <i>twist</i>, function as molecular ratchets."	0
"32755594"	"Genome-Wide Screens Reveal that Resveratrol Induces Replicative Stress in Human Cells.Resveratrol is a natural product associated with wide-ranging effects in animal and cellular models, including lifespan extension. To identify the genetic target of resveratrol in human cells, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to pinpoint genes that confer sensitivity or resistance to resveratrol. An extensive network of DNA damage response and replicative stress genes exhibited genetic interactions with resveratrol and its analog pterostilbene. These genetic profiles showed similarity to the response to hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase that causes replicative stress. Resveratrol, pterostilbene, and hydroxyurea caused similar depletion of nucleotide pools, inhibition of replication fork progression, and induction of replicative stress. The ability of resveratrol to inhibit cell proliferation and S phase transit was independent of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1, which has been implicated in lifespan extension by resveratrol. These results establish that a primary impact of resveratrol on human cell proliferation is the induction of low-level replicative stress."	0
"32616654"	"The NADPH oxidase NOX4 promotes the directed migration of endothelial cells by stabilizing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 protein.Directed migration of endothelial cells (ECs) is an important process during both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. The binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) on the EC surface is necessary for directed migration of these cells. Here, we used TAXIScan, an optically accessible real-time horizontal cell dynamics assay approach, and demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which is abundantly expressed in ECs, mediates VEGF/VEGFR-2-dependent directed migration. We noted that a continuous supply of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained VEGFR-2 to the plasma membrane is required to maintain VEGFR-2 at the cell surface. siRNA-mediated NOX4 silencing decreased the ER-retained form of VEGFR-2, resulting in decreased cell surface expression levels of the receptor. We also found that ER-localized NOX4 interacts with ER-retained VEGFR-2 and thereby stabilizes this ER-retained form at the protein level in the ER. We conclude that NOX4 contributes to the directed migration of ECs by maintaining VEGFR-2 levels at their surface."	0

Failures in these genome maintenance activities generate mutations, rearrangements, and chromosome segregation problems that cause many human diseases.

"32726631"	"A High-Resolution Method for Quantitative Molecular Analysis of Functionally Characterized Individual Synapses.Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of synapses requires a high-resolution, sensitive, diffusion-free, quantitative localization method that allows the determination of many proteins in functionally characterized individual synapses. Array tomography permits the quantitative analysis of single synapses but has limited sensitivity, and its application to functionally characterized synapses is challenging. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations by searching the parameter space of different fixation, resin, embedding, etching, retrieval, and elution conditions. Our optimizations reveal that etching epoxy-resin-embedded ultrathin sections with Na-ethanolate and treating them with SDS dramatically increase the labeling efficiency of synaptic proteins. We also demonstrate that this method is ideal for the molecular characterization of individual synapses following paired recordings, two-photon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] or glutamate-sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging. This method fills a missing gap in the toolbox of molecular and cellular neuroscience, helping us to reveal how molecular heterogeneity leads to diversity in function."	0
"31003868"	"tRNA Maturation Defects Lead to Inhibition of rRNA Processing via Synthesis of pppGpp.rRNAs and tRNAs universally require processing from longer primary transcripts to become functional for translation. Here, we describe an unsuspected link between tRNA maturation and the 3' processing of 16S rRNA, a key step in preparing the small ribosomal subunit for interaction with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotic translation initiation. We show that an accumulation of either 5' or 3' immature tRNAs triggers RelA-dependent production of the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The accumulation of (p)ppGpp and accompanying decrease in GTP levels specifically inhibit 16S rRNA 3' maturation.

"32130907"	"Postprandial Hyperglycemia Stimulates Neuroglial Plasticity in Hypothalamic POMC Neurons after a Balanced Meal.Mechanistic studies in rodents evidenced synaptic remodeling in neuronal circuits that control food intake. However, the physiological relevance of this process is not well defined. Here, we show that the firing activity of anorexigenic POMC neurons located in the hypothalamus is increased after a standard meal. Postprandial hyperactivity of POMC neurons relies on synaptic plasticity that engages pre-synaptic mechanisms, which does not involve structural remodeling of synapses but retraction of glial coverage. These functional and morphological neuroglial changes are triggered by postprandial hyperglycemia. Chemogenetically induced glial retraction on POMC neurons is sufficient to increase POMC activity and modify meal patterns. These findings indicate that synaptic plasticity within the melanocortin system happens at the timescale of meals and likely contributes to short-term control of food intake. Interestingly, these effects are lost with a high-fat meal, suggesting that neuroglial plasticity of POMC neurons is involved in the satietogenic properties of foods."	0
"32467224"	"HDAC3 ensures stepwise epidermal stratification via NCoR/SMRT-reliant mechanisms independent of its histone deacetylase activity.Chromatin modifiers play critical roles in epidermal development, but the functions of histone deacetylases in this context are poorly understood. The class I HDAC, HDAC3, is of particular interest because it plays divergent roles in different tissues by partnering with tissue-specific transcription factors. We found that HDAC3 is expressed broadly in embryonic epidermis and is required for its orderly stepwise stratification. HDAC3 protein stability in vivo relies on NCoR and SMRT, which function redundantly in epidermal development. However, point mutations in the NCoR and SMRT deacetylase-activating domains, which are required for HDAC3's enzymatic function, permit normal stratification, indicating that HDAC3's roles in this context are largely independent of its histone deacetylase activity. HDAC3-bound sites are significantly enriched for predicted binding motifs for critical epidermal transcription factors including AP1, GRHL, and KLF family members. Our results suggest that among these, HDAC3 operates in conjunction with KLF4 to repress inappropriate expression of <i>Tgm1</i>, <i>Krt16</i>, and <i>Aqp3</i> In parallel, HDAC3 suppresses expression of inflammatory cytokines through a <i>Rela</i>-dependent mechanism.

"32353257"	"Genomic Profiling by ALaP-Seq Reveals Transcriptional Regulation by PML Bodies through DNMT3A Exclusion.The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body is a phase-separated nuclear structure physically associated with chromatin, implying its crucial roles in genome functions. However, its role in transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. We developed APEX-mediated chromatin labeling and purification (ALaP) to identify the genomic regions proximal to PML bodies. We found that PML bodies associate with active regulatory regions across the genome and with ∼300 kb of the short arm of the Y chromosome (YS300) in mouse embryonic stem cells. The PML body association with YS300 is essential for the transcriptional activity of the neighboring Y-linked clustered genes. Mechanistically, PML bodies provide specific nuclear spaces that the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cannot access, resulting in the steady maintenance of a hypo-methylated state at Y-linked gene promoters.

"31492633"	"mTORC1 Activation Requires DRAM-1 by Facilitating Lysosomal Amino Acid Efflux.Sensing nutrient availability is essential for appropriate cellular growth, and mTORC1 is a major regulator of this process. Mechanisms causing mTORC1 activation are, however, complex and diverse. We report here an additional important step in the activation of mTORC1, which regulates the efflux of amino acids from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. This process requires DRAM-1, which binds the membrane carrier protein SCAMP3 and the amino acid transporters SLC1A5 and LAT1, directing them to lysosomes and permitting efficient mTORC1 activation. Consequently, we show that loss of DRAM-1 also impacts pathways regulated by mTORC1, including insulin signaling, glycemic balance, and adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, although DRAM-1 can promote autophagy, this effect on mTORC1 is autophagy independent, and autophagy only becomes important for mTORC1 activation when DRAM-1 is deleted. These findings provide important insights into mTORC1 activation and highlight the importance of DRAM-1 in growth control, metabolic homeostasis, and differentiation."	0
"32464092"	"Sequence-Independent Self-Assembly of Germ Granule mRNAs into Homotypic Clusters.mRNAs enriched in membraneless condensates provide functional compartmentalization within cells. The mechanisms that recruit transcripts to condensates are under intense study; however, how mRNAs organize once they reach a granule remains poorly understood. Here, we report on a self-sorting mechanism by which multiple mRNAs derived from the same gene assemble into discrete homotypic clusters. We demonstrate that in vivo mRNA localization to granules and self-assembly within granules are governed by different mRNA features: localization is encoded by specific RNA regions, whereas self-assembly involves the entire mRNA, does not involve sequence-specific, ordered intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions, and is thus RNA sequence independent. We propose that the ability of mRNAs to self-sort into homotypic assemblies is an inherent property of an messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) that is augmented under conditions that increase RNA concentration, such as upon enrichment in RNA-protein granules, a process that appears conserved in diverse cellular contexts and organisms."	0

Here, we identify a new modification at the CTD, the deimination of arginine and its conversion to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), an enzyme that has been associated with several diseases, including cancer. We show that, among PADI family members, only PADI2 citrullinates R1810 (Cit1810) at repeat 31 of the CTD. Depletion of PADI2 or loss of R1810 results in accumulation of RNAP2 at transcription start sites, reduced gene expression, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Cit1810 is needed for interaction with the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) kinase complex and for its recruitment to chromatin.

"30595436"	"Replication-Coupled DNA-Protein Crosslink Repair by SPRTN and the Proteasome in Xenopus Egg Extracts.DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are bulky lesions that interfere with DNA metabolism and therefore threaten genomic integrity. Recent studies implicate the metalloprotease SPRTN in S phase removal of DPCs, but how SPRTN is targeted to DPCs during DNA replication is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN and proteasome activities are coupled to DNA replication by distinct mechanisms that promote replication across immovable protein barriers."	0
"32294448"	"Thermodynamic and Evolutionary Coupling between the Native and Amyloid State of Globular Proteins.The amyloid-like aggregation propensity present in most globular proteins is generally considered to be a secondary side effect resulting from the requirements of protein stability. Here, we demonstrate, however, that mutations in the globular and amyloid state are thermodynamically correlated rather than simply associated. In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations. We speculate that, rather than being a corollary of protein evolution, it is equally plausible that positive selection for amyloid structure could have been a driver for the emergence of globular protein structure."	0

Here, we show that TLK loss results in severe chromatin decompaction and altered genome accessibility, particularly affecting heterochromatic regions. Failure to maintain heterochromatin increases spurious transcription of repetitive elements and induces features of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). TLK depletion culminates in a cGAS-STING-TBK1-mediated innate immune response that is independent of replication-stress signaling and attenuated by the depletion of factors required to produce extra-telomeric DNA. Analysis of human cancers reveals that chromosomal instability correlates with high TLK2 and low STING levels in many cohorts. Based on these findings, we propose that high TLK levels contribute to immune evasion in chromosomally unstable and ALT+ cancers."	0

We report that 3q26 CNGs occur early in LSCC tumorigenesis, persist during tumor progression, and drive coordinate overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2. Overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 in the context of Trp53 loss is sufficient to transform mouse lung basal stem cells into tumors with histological and genomic features of LSCC.

We developed nanopore analysis of co-transcriptional processing (nano-COP), in which nascent RNAs are directly sequenced through nanopores, exposing the dynamics and patterns of RNA splicing without biases introduced by amplification. Long nano-COP reads reveal that, in human and Drosophila cells, splicing occurs after RNA polymerase II transcribes several kilobases of pre-mRNA, suggesting that metazoan splicing transpires distally from the transcription machinery. Inhibition of the branch-site recognition complex SF3B rapidly diminished global co-transcriptional splicing. We found that splicing order does not strictly follow the order of transcription and is associated with cis-acting elements, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding factors. Further, neighboring introns in human cells tend to be spliced concurrently, implying that splicing of these introns occurs cooperatively. Thus, nano-COP unveils the organizational complexity of RNA processing."	0

Retina-specific deletion of Lhx4 in mice results in a visual defect resembling human congenital stationary night blindness. This visual dysfunction results from the absence of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and the loss of selective rod-connecting cone bipolar cell (CBC) subtypes and AII amacrine cells (ACs). Inactivation of Lhx4 causes the apoptosis of BCs and cell fate switch from some BCs to ACs, whereas Lhx4 overexpression promotes BC genesis. Moreover, Lhx4 positively regulates Lhx3 expression to drive the fate choice of type 2 BCs over the GABAergic ACs. Lhx4 inactivation ablates Bhlhe23 expression, whereas overexpression of Bhlhe23 partially rescues RBC development in the absence of Lhx4. Thus, by acting upstream of Bhlhe23, Prdm8, Fezf2, Lhx3, and other BC genes, Lhx4, together with Isl1, could play essential roles in regulating the subtype-specific development of RBCs and CBCs."	0

The structures illustrate how G<sub>T</sub> overcomes its low basal activity by engaging activated Rho in a conformation distinct from other GPCR-G-protein complexes. Moreover, the nanobody-free structures reveal native conformations of G-protein components and capture three distinct conformers showing the Gα<sub>T</sub> helical domain (αHD) contacting the Gβγ subunits. These findings uncover the molecular underpinnings of G-protein activation by visual rhodopsin and shed new light on the role played by Gβγ during receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange."	0

Functionally important AGP glycans are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, but the relationships among their glycosylation levels, processing, and functionalities are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of two Golgi-localized exo-β-1,3-galactosidases from the glycosyl hydrolase 43 (GH43) family in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> GH43 loss-of-function mutants exhibited root cell expansion defects in sugar-containing growth media. This root phenotype was associated with an increase in the extent of AGP cell wall association, as demonstrated by Yariv phenylglycoside dye quantification and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling of sequentially extracted cell walls. Characterization of recombinant GH43 variants revealed that the exo-β-1,3-galactosidase activity of GH43 enzymes is hindered by β-1,6 branches on β-1,3-galactans. In line with this steric hindrance, the recombinant GH43 variants did not release galactose from cell wall-extracted glycoproteins or AGP-rich gum arabic. These results indicate that the lack of exo-β-1,3-galactosidase activity alters cell wall extensibility in roots, a phenotype that could be explained by the involvement of galactosidases in AGP glycan biosynthesis."	0
"32130896"	"An Integrated Metagenome Catalog Reveals New Insights into the Murine Gut Microbiome.The complexity of host-associated microbial ecosystems requires host-specific reference catalogs to survey the functions and diversity of these communities. We generate a comprehensive resource, the integrated mouse gut metagenome catalog (iMGMC), comprising 4.6 million unique genes and 660 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), many (485 MAGs, 73%) of which are linked to reconstructed full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. iMGMC enables unprecedented coverage and taxonomic resolution of the mouse gut microbiota; i.e., more than 92% of MAGs lack species-level representatives in public repositories (<95% ANI match). The integration of MAGs and 16S rRNA gene data allows more accurate prediction of functional profiles of communities than predictions based on 16S rRNA amplicons alone. Accompanying iMGMC, we provide a set of MAGs representing 1,296 gut bacteria obtained through complementary assembly strategies. We envision that integrated resources such as iMGMC, together with MAG collections, will enhance the resolution of numerous existing and future sequencing-based studies."	0
"30772175"	"PINK1 Inhibits Local Protein Synthesis to Limit Transmission of Deleterious Mitochondrial DNA Mutations.We have previously proposed that selective inheritance, the limited transmission of damaging mtDNA mutations from mother to offspring, is based on replication competition in Drosophila melanogaster. This model, which stems from our observation that wild-type mitochondria propagate much more vigorously in the fly ovary than mitochondria carrying fitness-impairing mutations, implies that germ cells recognize the fitness of individual mitochondria and selectively boost the propagation of healthy ones. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase PINK1 preferentially accumulates on mitochondria enriched for a deleterious mtDNA mutation. PINK1 phosphorylates Larp to inhibit protein synthesis on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Impaired local translation on defective mitochondria in turn limits the replication of their mtDNA and hence the transmission of deleterious mutations to the offspring. Our work confirms that selective inheritance occurs at the organelle level during Drosophila oogenesis and provides molecular entry points to test this model in other systems."	0
"32755590"	"Single-Cell RNA Profiling Reveals Adipocyte to Macrophage Signaling Sufficient to Enhance Thermogenesis.Adipocytes deficient in fatty acid synthase (iAdFASNKO) emit signals that mimic cold exposure to enhance the appearance of thermogenic beige adipocytes in mouse inguinal white adipose tissues (iWATs). Both cold exposure and iAdFASNKO upregulate the sympathetic nerve fiber (SNF) modulator Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), activate SNFs, and require adipocyte cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling for beige adipocyte appearance, as it is blocked by adipocyte Gsα deficiency. Surprisingly, however, in contrast to cold-exposed mice, neither iWAT denervation nor Nrg4 loss attenuated adipocyte browning in iAdFASNKO mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of iWAT stromal cells revealed increased macrophages displaying gene expression signatures of the alternately activated type in iAdFASNKO mice, and their depletion abrogated iWAT beiging. Altogether, these findings reveal that divergent cellular pathways are sufficient to cause adipocyte browning. Importantly, adipocyte signaling to enhance alternatively activated macrophages in iAdFASNKO mice is associated with enhanced adipose thermogenesis independent of the sympathetic neuron involvement this process requires in the cold."	0
"32554809"	"BioID screening of biotinylation sites using the avidin-like protein Tamavidin 2-REV identifies global interactors of stimulator of interferon genes (STING).Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) mediates cytosolic DNA-induced innate immune signaling via membrane trafficking. The global identification of proteins that spatiotemporally interact with STING will provide a better understanding of its trafficking mechanisms and of STING signaling pathways. Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) is a powerful technology to identify physiologically relevant protein-protein interactions in living cells. However, biotinylated peptides are rarely detected in the conventional BioID method, which uses streptavidin beads to pull down biotinylated proteins, because the biotin-streptavidin interaction is too strong. As a result, only nonbiotinylated peptides are identified, which cannot be distinguished from peptides of nonspecifically pull-downed proteins. Here, we developed a simple method to efficiently and specifically enrich biotinylated peptides using Tamavidin 2-REV, an engineered avidin-like protein with reversible biotin-binding capability. Using RAW264.7 macrophages stably expressing TurboID-fused STING, we identified and quantified >4,000 biotinylated peptides of STING-proximal proteins. Various endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins were biotinylated in unstimulated cells, and STING activation caused biotinylation of many proteins located in the Golgi and endosomes. These proteins included those known to interact with activated STING, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), several palmitoyl transferases, and p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1). Furthermore, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), an endolysosome-localized antiviral protein, bound to STING at the late activation stage. These dynamic interaction profiles will provide detailed insights into STING signaling; we propose that our approach using Tamavidin 2-REV would be useful for BioID-based and other biotinylation-based peptide identification methods."	0
"32579934"	"Skeletal Muscle Transcriptomic Comparison between Long-Term Trained and Untrained Men and Women.To better understand the health benefits of lifelong exercise in humans, we conduct global skeletal muscle transcriptomic analyses of long-term endurance- (9 men, 9 women) and strength-trained (7 men) humans compared with age-matched untrained controls (7 men, 8 women). Transcriptomic analysis, Gene Ontology, and genome-scale metabolic modeling demonstrate changes in pathways related to the prevention of metabolic diseases, particularly with endurance training. Our data also show prominent sex differences between controls and that these differences are reduced with endurance training. Additionally, we compare our data with studies examining muscle gene expression before and after a months-long training period in individuals with metabolic diseases. This analysis reveals that training shifts gene expression in individuals with impaired metabolism to become more similar to our endurance-trained group. Overall, our data provide an extensive examination of the accumulated transcriptional changes that occur with decades-long training and identify important ""exercise-responsive"" genes that could attenuate metabolic disease."	0
"32521269"	"The Protein Arginine Methyltransferase PRMT8 and Substrate G3BP1 Control Rac1-PAK1 Signaling and Actin Cytoskeleton for Dendritic Spine Maturation.Excitatory synapses of neurons are located on dendritic spines. Spine maturation is essential for the stability of synapses and memory consolidation, and overproduction of the immature filopodia is associated with brain disorders. The structure and function of synapses can be modulated by protein post-translational modification (PTM). Arginine methylation is a major PTM that regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and splicing within the nucleus. Here we find that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 is present at neuronal synapses and its expression is upregulated in the hippocampus when dendritic spine maturation occurs. Depletion of PRMT8 leads to overabundance of filopodia and mis-localization of excitatory synapses. Mechanistically, PRMT8 promotes dendritic spine morphology through methylation of the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1 and suppression of the Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway to control synaptic actin dynamics. Our findings unravel arginine methylation as a crucial regulatory mechanism for actin cytoskeleton during synapse development."	1

While numerous studies have identified somatic correlates of immune infiltration, germline features that associate with immune infiltrates in cancers remain incompletely characterized. We analyze seven million autosomal germline variants in the TCGA cohort and test for association with established immune-related phenotypes that describe the tumor immune microenvironment. We identify one SNP associated with the amount of infiltrating follicular helper T cells; 23 candidate genes, some of which are involved in cytokine-mediated signaling and others containing cancer-risk SNPs; and networks with genes that are part of the DNA repair and transcription elongation pathways. In addition, we find a positive association between polygenic risk for rheumatoid arthritis and amount of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Overall, we identify multiple germline genetic features associated with tumor-immune phenotypes and develop a framework for probing inherited features that contribute to differences in immune infiltration."	0
"32601372"	"Unrestrained ESCRT-III drives micronuclear catastrophe and chromosome fragmentation.The ESCRT-III membrane fission machinery maintains the integrity of the nuclear envelope. Although primary nuclei resealing takes minutes, micronuclear envelope ruptures seem to be irreversible. Instead, micronuclear ruptures result in catastrophic membrane collapse and are associated with chromosome fragmentation and chromothripsis, complex chromosome rearrangements thought to be a major driving force in cancer development. Here we use a combination of live microscopy and electron tomography, as well as computer simulations, to uncover the mechanism underlying micronuclear collapse. We show that, due to their small size, micronuclei inherently lack the capacity of primary nuclei to restrict the accumulation of CHMP7-LEMD2, a compartmentalization sensor that detects loss of nuclear integrity. This causes unrestrained ESCRT-III accumulation, which drives extensive membrane deformation, DNA damage and chromosome fragmentation. Thus, the nuclear-integrity surveillance machinery is a double-edged sword, as its sensitivity ensures rapid repair at primary nuclei while causing unrestrained activity at ruptured micronuclei, with catastrophic consequences for genome stability."	0
"32294446"	"Contributions of the Conserved Insect Carbon Dioxide Receptor Subunits to Odor Detection.The CO<sub>2</sub> receptor in mosquitoes is broadly tuned to detect many diverse odorants. The receptor consists of three subunits (Gr1, Gr2, and Gr3) in mosquitoes but only two subunits in Drosophila: Gr21a (Gr1 ortholog) and Gr63a (Gr3 ortholog). We demonstrate that Gr21a is required for CO<sub>2</sub> responses in Drosophila, as has been shown for Gr63a. Next, we generate a Drosophila double mutant for Gr21a and Gr63a, and in this background, we functionally express combinations of Aedes Gr1, Gr2, and Gr3 genes in the CO<sub>2</sub> empty neuron. Only two subunits, Gr2 and Gr3, suffice for response to CO<sub>2</sub>. Addition of Gr1 increases sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas it decreases the response to pyridine. The inhibitory effect of the antagonist isobutyric acid is observed upon addition of Gr1. Gr1 therefore increases the diversity of ligands of the receptor and modulates the response of the receptor complex."	0
"32719551"	"Biophysical properties of AKAP95 protein condensates regulate splicing and tumorigenesis.It remains unknown if biophysical or material properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cancer. Here we show that AKAP95, a nuclear protein that regulates transcription and RNA splicing, plays an important role in tumorigenesis by supporting cancer cell growth and suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. AKAP95 forms phase-separated and liquid-like condensates in vitro and in nucleus. Mutations of key residues to different amino acids perturb AKAP95 condensation in opposite directions. Importantly, the activity of AKAP95 in splice regulation is abolished by disruption of condensation, significantly impaired by hardening of condensates, and regained by substituting its condensation-mediating region with other condensation-mediating regions from irrelevant proteins. Moreover, the abilities of AKAP95 in regulating gene expression and supporting tumorigenesis require AKAP95 to form condensates with proper liquidity and dynamicity. These results link phase separation to tumorigenesis and uncover an important role of appropriate biophysical properties of protein condensates in gene regulation and cancer."	0
"31522988"	"RNA Interactions Are Essential for CTCF-Mediated Genome Organization.The function of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the organization of the genome has become an important area of investigation, but the mechanisms by which CTCF dynamically contributes to genome organization are not clear. We previously discovered that CTCF binds to large numbers of endogenous RNAs, promoting its self-association. In this regard, we now report two independent features that disrupt CTCF association with chromatin: inhibition of transcription and disruption of CTCF-RNA interactions through mutations of 2 of its 11 zinc fingers that are not required for CTCF binding to its cognate DNA site: zinc finger 1 (ZF1) or zinc finger 10 (ZF10). These mutations alter gene expression profiles as CTCF mutants lose their ability to form chromatin loops and thus the ability to insulate chromatin domains and to mediate CTCF long-range genomic interactions. Our results point to the importance of CTCF-mediated RNA interactions as a structural component of genome organization."	0

With the global population set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, and the compounding effects of climate change, the planet is facing challenges that necessitate significant and rapid changes in agricultural practices. In the effort to provide food in terms of calories, the essential contribution of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to nutrition is often overlooked. Here, we focus on the importance of thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) in plant health and discuss its impact on human health. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is an essential dietary component, and deficiencies in this micronutrient underlie several diseases, notably nervous system disorders. The predominant source of dietary vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is plant-based foods. Moreover, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also vital for plants themselves, and its benefits in plant health have received less attention than in the human health sphere. In general, vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is well-characterized for its role as a coenzyme in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in energy production and central metabolism, including carbon assimilation and respiration. Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> is also emerging as an important component of plant stress responses, and several noncoenzyme roles of this vitamin are being characterized. We summarize the importance of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> in plants from the perspective of food security, including its roles in plant disease resistance, stress tolerance, and crop yield, and review the potential benefits of biofortification of crops with increased vitamin B<sub>1</sub> content to improve human health."	0
"32561640"	"The guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV3 participates in ERBB4-mediated cancer cell migration.ERBB4 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that regulates cellular processes including proliferation, migration, and survival. ERBB4 signaling is involved in embryogenesis and homeostasis of healthy adult tissues, but also in human pathologies such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Here, an MS-based analysis revealed the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (VAV3), an activator of Rho family GTPases, as a critical ERBB4-interacting protein in breast cancer cells. We confirmed the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction by targeted MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments and further defined it by demonstrating that kinase activity and Tyr-1022 and Tyr-1162 of ERBB4, as well as the intact phosphotyrosine-interacting SH2 domain of VAV3, are necessary for this interaction. We found that ERBB4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the VAV3 activation domain, known to be required for guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of VAV proteins. In addition to VAV3, the other members of the VAV family, VAV1 and VAV2, also coprecipitated with ERBB4. Analyses of the effects of overexpression of dominant-negative VAV3 constructs or shRNA-mediated down-regulation of VAV3 expression in breast cancer cells indicated that active VAV3 is involved in ERBB4-stimulated cell migration. These results define the VAV GEFs as effectors of ERBB4 activity in a signaling pathway relevant for cancer cell migration."	1

Here, we combine induced neurons (iNeurons) derived from embryonic stem cells with quantitative proteomics to reveal the dynamics and specificity of Parkin-dependent ubiquitylation under endogenous expression conditions. Targets showing elevated ubiquitylation in USP30<sup>-/-</sup> iNeurons are concentrated in components of the mitochondrial translocon, and the ubiquitylation kinetics of the vast majority of Parkin targets are unaffected, correlating with a modest kinetic acceleration in accumulation of pS65-Ub and mitophagic flux upon mitochondrial depolarization without USP30. Basally, ubiquitylated translocon import substrates accumulate, suggesting a quality control function for USP30. p97 was dispensable for Parkin ligase activity in iNeurons. This work provides an unprecedented quantitative landscape of the Parkin-modified ubiquitylome in iNeurons and reveals the underlying specificity of central regulatory elements in the pathway."	0

Although substantial progress has been achieved regarding the mechanisms underlying flower development, little is known about how petal cells achieve final conical shape. Here, we use 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) as a fluorescent pH indicator for analyzing the apoplastic pH of conical cells in Arabidopsis and show that normal conical cell expansion requires auxin signaling and apoplastic pH changes. By combining imaging analysis and genetic and pharmacological experiments, we demonstrate that apoplastic acidification and alkalization correlate with an increase and decrease in tip sharpening of conical cells, respectively. Initial expansion of conical cells is accompanied by decreased apoplastic pH, which is associated with increased auxin signaling. Decreased auxin levels, transport, or signaling abolishes cell wall acidification and causes reduced tip sharpening and heights of conical cells. These findings provide an insight into apoplastic pH regulation of conical cell expansion."	0

Although the occurrence of LOI is considered a stochastic phenomenon, here we document a genetic determinant that segregates mouse pluripotent cells into stable and unstable cell lines. Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and other imprinted loci, in addition to impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and loss of developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we use to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis.

Here, we study how a wide range of chemosignals form a discernible map of olfactory information in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) and show that different stimuli entail distinct active neural ensembles. Importantly, we demonstrate that this map depends on functional inputs from the vomeronasal organ. We present evidence that the spatial locations of active VMH ensembles are correlated with activation of distinct vomeronasal receptors and that disjunct VMH ensembles exhibit differential projection patterns. Moreover, active ensembles with distinct spatial locations are not necessarily associated with different behavior categories, such as defensive or social, calling for a revision of the currently accepted model of VMH organization."	0

However, the mechanisms that repress young L1 families and how L1 escapes to cause somatic genome mosaicism in the brain remain unclear. Here we report that a conserved Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor binding site mediates L1 promoter DNA methylation in pluripotent and differentiated cells. By analyzing 24 hippocampal neurons with three distinct single-cell genomic approaches, we characterized and validated a somatic L1 insertion bearing a 3' transduction. The source (donor) L1 for this insertion was slightly 5' truncated, lacked the YY1 binding site, and was highly mobile when tested in vitro. Locus-specific bisulfite sequencing revealed that the donor L1 and other young L1s with mutated YY1 binding sites were hypomethylated in embryonic stem cells, during neurodifferentiation, and in liver and brain tissue. These results explain how L1 can evade repression and retrotranspose in the human body."	0

Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles specialized in lipid storage that interact physically with mitochondria in several cell types. The mechanisms coupling these organelles are, however, poorly understood, and the cell-biological function of their interaction remains largely unknown. Here, we discover in adipocytes that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MIGA2 links mitochondria to LDs. We identify an amphipathic LD-targeting motif and reveal that MIGA2 binds to the membrane proteins VAP-A or VAP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We find that in adipocytes MIGA2 is involved in promoting triglyceride (TAG) synthesis from non-lipid precursors. Our data indicate that MIGA2 links reactions of de novo lipogenesis in mitochondria to TAG production in the ER, thereby facilitating efficient lipid storage in LDs. Based on its presence in many tissues, MIGA2 is likely critical for lipid and energy homeostasis in a wide spectrum of cell types."	0

Here, we show that the replicative helicase component Cdc45 targets the checkpoint kinase Rad53 to distinct replication complexes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad53 binds to forkhead-associated (FHA) interaction motifs in an unstructured loop region of Cdc45, which is phosphorylated by Rad53 itself, and this interaction is necessary for the inhibition of origin firing through Sld3. Cdc45 also recruits Rad53 to stalled replication forks, which we demonstrate is important for the response to replication stress. Finally, we show that a Cdc45 mutation found in patients with Meier-Gorlin syndrome disrupts the functional interaction with Rad53 in yeast. Together, we present a single mechanism by which a checkpoint kinase targets replication initiation and elongation complexes, which may be relevant to human disease."	1

Calcium signaling is also implicated in B cell activation; however, its involvement in the cytokine production of LPS-stimulated B cells remains less well characterized. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential melastatin 5 channel (TRPM5), which is one of the CAMs, negatively modulates calcium signaling, thereby regulating LPS-induced proliferative and inflammatory responses by B cells. LPS-stimulated B cells of Trpm5-deficient mice exhibit an increased cytosolic calcium concentration, leading to enhanced proliferation and the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and CXCL10.

"32726616"	"PHF7 Modulates BRDT Stability and Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis.Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system."	1

"32220303"	"4D Genome Rewiring during Oncogene-Induced and Replicative Senescence.To understand the role of the extensive senescence-associated 3D genome reorganization, we generated genome-wide chromatin interaction maps, epigenome, replication-timing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and gene expression profiles from cells entering replicative senescence (RS) or upon oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). We identify senescence-associated heterochromatin domains (SAHDs). Differential intra- versus inter-SAHD interactions lead to the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) in OIS but not in RS. This OIS-specific configuration brings active genes located in genomic regions adjacent to SAHDs in close spatial proximity and favors their expression. We also identify DNMT1 as a factor that induces SAHFs by promoting HMGA2 expression. Upon DNMT1 depletion, OIS cells transition to a 3D genome conformation akin to that of cells in replicative senescence. These data show how multi-omics and imaging can identify critical features of RS and OIS and discover determinants of acute senescence and SAHF formation."	0

We examine the in vivo effects of GNE-0723, a positive allosteric modulator of GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDARs, on brain network and cognitive functions in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). GNE-0723 use dependently potentiates synaptic NMDA receptor currents and reduces brain oscillation power with a predominant effect on low-frequency (12-20 Hz) oscillations. Interestingly, DS and AD mouse models display aberrant low-frequency oscillatory power that is tightly correlated with network hypersynchrony. GNE-0723 treatment reduces aberrant low-frequency oscillations and epileptiform discharges and improves cognitive functions in DS and AD mouse models.

Synaptic plasticity mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate differential behavioral adaptations. Feedforward inhibition in the NAc occurs when glutamatergic afferents onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) collateralize onto fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), which exert GABAergic control over MSN action potential generation. Here, we find that feedforward glutamatergic synapses onto PV-INs in the NAc core selectively express Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by CP-AMPARs on PV-INs triggers long-term depression (LTD) mediated by endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at presynaptic cannabinoid type-1 (CB<sub>1</sub>) receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs). Moreover, CP-AMPARs authorize tonic eCB signaling to negatively regulate glutamate release probability. Blockade of CP-AMPARs in the NAc core in vivo is sufficient to disinhibit locomotor output. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which PV-IN-embedded microcircuits in the NAc undergo activity-dependent shifts in synaptic strength."	0
"32540970"	"The GTPase-activating protein p120RasGAP has an evolutionarily conserved ""FLVR-unique"" SH2 domain.The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain has a highly conserved architecture that recognizes linear phosphotyrosine motifs and is present in a wide range of signaling pathways across different evolutionary taxa. A hallmark of SH2 domains is the arginine residue in the conserved FLVR motif that forms a direct salt bridge with bound phosphotyrosine. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP (<i>RASA1</i>) in its apo and peptide-bound form. We find that the arginine residue in the FLVR motif does not directly contact pTyr<sup>1087</sup> of a bound phosphopeptide derived from p190RhoGAP; rather, it makes an intramolecular salt bridge to an aspartic acid. Unexpectedly, coordination of phosphotyrosine is achieved by a modified binding pocket that appears early in evolution. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we find that substitution of the FLVR arginine R377A does not cause a significant loss of phosphopeptide binding, but rather a tandem substitution of R398A (SH2 position βD4) and K400A (SH2 position βD6) is required to disrupt the binding. These results indicate a hitherto unrecognized diversity in SH2 domain interactions with phosphotyrosine and classify the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP as ""FLVR-unique."""	0
"32294452"	"A WIZ/Cohesin/CTCF Complex Anchors DNA Loops to Define Gene Expression and Cell Identity.Chromosome structure is a key regulator of gene expression. CTCF and cohesin play critical roles in structuring chromosomes by mediating physical interactions between distant genomic sites. The resulting DNA loops often contain genes and their cis-regulatory elements. Despite the importance of DNA loops in maintaining proper transcriptional regulation and cell identity, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate their dynamics and function. We report a previously unrecognized role for WIZ (widely interspaced zinc finger-containing protein) in DNA loop architecture and regulation of gene expression. WIZ forms a complex with cohesin and CTCF that occupies enhancers, promoters, insulators, and anchors of DNA loops. Aberrant WIZ function alters cohesin occupancy and increases the number of DNA loop structures in the genome. WIZ is required for proper gene expression and transcriptional insulation. Our results uncover an unexpected role for WIZ in DNA loop architecture, transcriptional control, and maintenance of cell identity."	0

The mechanistic basis for activation of this ribotoxic stress response (RSR) remains completely obscure. We show that the long isoform of ZAK (ZAKα) directly associates with ribosomes by inserting its flexible C terminus into the ribosomal intersubunit space. Here, ZAKα binds helix 14 of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). An adjacent domain in ZAKα also probes the ribosome, and together, these sensor domains are critically required for RSR activation after inhibition of both the E-site, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), and ribotoxin action. Finally, we show that ablation of the RSR response leads to organismal phenotypes and decreased lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Our findings yield mechanistic insight into how cells detect ribotoxic stress and provide experimental in vivo evidence for its physiological importance."	0

"31837995"	"Polycomb Group Proteins Regulate Chromatin Architecture in Mouse Oocytes and Early Embryos.In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reorganization during oocyte development. However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs. These data reveal a critical role of Polycomb in regulating chromatin architecture during mammalian oocyte growth and early development."	0
"31940490"	"p53 Integrates Temporal WDR5 Inputs during Neuroectoderm and Mesoderm Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.How ubiquitous transcription factors (TFs) coordinate temporal inputs from broadly expressed epigenetic factors to control cell fate remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a molecular relationship between p53, an abundant embryonic TF, and WDR5, an essential member of the MLL chromatin modifying complex, that regulates mouse embryonic stem cell fate. Wild-type Wdr5 or transient Wdr5 knockout promotes a distinct pattern of global chromatin accessibility and spurs neuroectodermal differentiation through an RbBP5-dependent process in which WDR5 binds to, and activates transcription of, neural genes. Wdr5 rescue after its prolonged inhibition targets WDR5 to mesoderm lineage-specifying genes, stimulating differentiation toward mesoderm fates in a p53-dependent fashion. Finally, we identify a direct interaction between WDR5 and p53 that enables their co-recruitment to, and regulation of, genes known to control cell proliferation and fate.

"32726621"	"Active Lysogeny in Listeria Monocytogenes Is a Bacteria-Phage Adaptive Response in the Mammalian Environment.Some Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) strains harbor a prophage within the comK gene, which renders it inactive. During Lm infection of macrophage cells, the prophage turns into a molecular switch, promoting comK gene expression and therefore Lm intracellular growth. During this process, the prophage does not produce infective phages or cause bacterial lysis, suggesting it has acquired an adaptive behavior suited to the pathogenic lifestyle of its host. In this study, we demonstrate that this non-classical phage behavior, named active lysogeny, relies on a transcriptional response that is specific to the intracellular niche. While the prophage undergoes lytic induction, the process is arrested midway, preventing the transcription of the late genes. Further, we demonstrate key phage factors, such as LlgA transcription regulator and a DNA replicase, that support the phage adaptive behavior. This study provides molecular insights into the adaptation of phages to their pathogenic hosts, uncovering unusual cooperative interactions."	0
"30827740"	"Xist Deletional Analysis Reveals an Interdependency between Xist RNA and Polycomb Complexes for Spreading along the Inactive X.During X-inactivation, Xist RNA spreads along an entire chromosome to establish silencing. However, the mechanism and functional RNA elements involved in spreading remain undefined. By performing a comprehensive endogenous Xist deletion screen, we identify Repeat B as crucial for spreading Xist and maintaining Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/PRC2) along the inactive X (Xi). Unexpectedly, spreading of these three factors is inextricably linked. Deleting Repeat B or its direct binding partner, HNRNPK, compromises recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2. In turn, ablating PRC1 or PRC2 impairs Xist spreading. Therefore, Xist and Polycomb complexes require each other to propagate along the Xi, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between RNA initiator and protein effectors. Perturbing Xist/Polycomb spreading causes failure of de novo Xi silencing, with partial compensatory downregulation of the active X, and also disrupts topological Xi reconfiguration. Thus, Repeat B is a multifunctional element that integrates interdependent Xist/Polycomb spreading, silencing, and changes in chromosome architecture."	0

It is important to identify additional therapeutic targets in ccRCC downstream of VHL loss besides hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α). By performing a genome-wide screen, we identified Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 1 (SFMBT1) as a candidate pVHL target. SFMBT1 was considered to be a transcriptional repressor but its role in cancer remains unclear. ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations displayed elevated SFMBT1 protein levels. SFMBT1 hydroxylation on Proline residue 651 by EglN1 mediated its ubiquitination and degradation governed by pVHL. Depletion of SFMBT1 abolished ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Integrated analyses of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and patient prognosis identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a key SFMBT1 target gene contributing to its oncogenic phenotype.

"31914398"	"Hyaluronan Degradation by Cemip Regulates Host Defense against Staphylococcus aureus Skin Infection.Staphylococcus aureus is a major human bacterial pathogen responsible for deep tissue skin infections. Recent observations have suggested that rapid, localized digestion of hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the dermis may influence bacterial invasion and tissue inflammation. In this study we find that cell migration-inducing protein (Cemip) is the major inducible gene responsible for hyaluronan catabolism in mice. Cemip<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to digest hyaluronan and had significantly less evidence of infection after intradermal bacterial challenge by S. aureus. Stabilization of large-molecular-weight hyaluronan enabled increased expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (Camp) that was due in part to enhanced differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes, as seen histologically and by increased expression of Pref1, PPARg, and Adipoq. Cemip<sup>-/-</sup> mice challenged with S. aureus also had greater IL-6 expression and neutrophil infiltration. These observations describe a mechanism for hyaluronan in the dermal ECM to regulate tissue inflammation and host antimicrobial defense."	0

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show heterogeneity among Gli1+ MSCs and identify a subpopulation of Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult mouse incisor. These Runx2+/Gli1+ cells are strategically located between MSCs and transit-amplifying cells (TACs). They are not stem cells but help to maintain the MSC niche via IGF signaling to regulate TAC proliferation, differentiation, and incisor growth rate. ATAC-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation reveal that Runx2 directly binds to Igfbp3 in niche cells.

"32294442"	"A Localized Scaffold for cGMP Increase Is Required for Apical Dendrite Development.Studies in cultured neurons have established that axon specification instructs neuronal polarization and is necessary for dendrite development. However, dendrite formation in vivo occurs when axon formation is prevented. The mechanisms promoting dendrite development remain elusive. We find that apical dendrite development is directed by a localized cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-synthesizing complex. We show that the scaffolding protein Scribble associates with cGMP-synthesizing enzymes soluble-guanylate-cyclase (sGC) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The Scribble scaffold is preferentially localized to and mediates cGMP increase in dendrites. These events are regulated by kinesin KifC2. Knockdown of Scribble, sGC-β1, or KifC2 or disrupting their associations prevents cGMP increase in dendrites and causes severe defects in apical dendrite development. Local cGMP elevation or sGC expression rescues the effects of Scribble knockdown on dendrite development, indicating that Scribble is an upstream regulator of cGMP. During neuronal polarization, dendrite development is directed by the Scribble scaffold that might link extracellular cues to localized cGMP increase."	0
"32697984"	"RSK2 Maintains Adult Estrogen Homeostasis by Inhibiting ERK1/2-Mediated Degradation of Estrogen Receptor Alpha.In response to estrogens, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a critical regulator of homeostasis, is degraded through the 26S proteasome. However, despite the continued presence of estrogen before menopause, ERα protein levels are maintained. We discovered that ERK1/2-RSK2 activity oscillates during the estrous cycle. In response to high estrogen levels, ERK1/2 is activated and phosphorylates ERα to drive ERα degradation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Reduction of estrogen levels results in ERK1/2 deactivation. RSK2 maintains redox homeostasis, which prevents sustained ERK1/2 activation. In juveniles, ERK1/2-RSK2 activity is not required. Mammary gland regeneration demonstrates that ERK1/2-RSK2 regulation of ERα is intrinsic to the epithelium. Reduced RSK2 and enrichment in an estrogen-regulated gene signature occur in individuals taking oral contraceptives. RSK2 loss enhances DNA damage, which may account for the elevated breast cancer risk with the use of exogenous estrogens. These findings implicate RSK2 as a critical component for the preservation of estrogen homeostasis."	1

Rep-Seq uses fixed residual tumor material, which is homogenized and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Analysis of intratumor tumor mutation burden (TMB) variability shows a high level of misclassification using current single-biopsy methods, with 20% of lung and 52% of bladder tumors having at least one biopsy with high TMB but low clonal TMB overall.

We recently identified a role for one specific tRF-5' tRF-Gly-GCC, or tRF-GG-as a repressor of genes associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, but the mechanistic basis for this regulation was unknown. Here, we show that tRF-GG plays a role in production of a wide variety of noncoding RNAs-snoRNAs, scaRNAs, and snRNAs-that are dependent on Cajal bodies for stability and activity. Among these noncoding RNAs, regulation of the U7 snRNA by tRF-GG modulates heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional repression of MERVL elements by supporting an adequate supply of histone proteins. Importantly, the effects of inhibiting tRF-GG on histone mRNA levels, on activity of a histone 3' UTR reporter, and ultimately on MERVL regulation could all be suppressed by manipulating U7 RNA levels. We additionally show that the related RNA-binding proteins hnRNPF and hnRNPH bind directly to tRF-GG, and are required for Cajal body biogenesis, positioning these proteins as strong candidates for effectors of tRF-GG function in vivo. Together, our data reveal a conserved mechanism for 5' tRNA fragment control of noncoding RNA biogenesis and, consequently, global chromatin organization."	0

Here, we define a novel genotoxic response whereby spatially separated signals initiated by extracellular neurotrophic factors and nuclear DNA damage are integrated by the AKT-mTORC1 pathway. We demonstrate that endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by Topoisomerase 2β-DNA cleavage complex (TOP2βcc) intermediates are required to achieve AKT-mTORC1 signaling and maintain HSV-1 latency in neurons. Suppression of host DNA-repair pathways that remove TOP2βcc trigger HSV-1 reactivation. Moreover, perturbation of AKT phosphorylation dynamics by downregulating the PHLPP1 phosphatase led to AKT mis-localization and disruption of DSB-induced HSV-1 reactivation.

Furthermore, long-term tubular engraftment of nephrospheres is functionally beneficial in murine models of chronic kidney disease. Remarkably, nephrospheres inhibit pro-fibrotic collagen production in cultured fibroblasts via paracrine modulation, while transplanted nephrospheres induce transcriptional signatures of proliferation and release from quiescence, suggesting re-activation of endogenous repair.

Using a combination of biochemistry, genetics, and live-imaging methods, we show that IFT complex B proteins (Ift88, Ift54, and Ift20) modulate the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in zebrafish and mouse. We demonstrate that this interaction is key to restrict the formation of the proepicardium and the myocardium. In cellulo experiments suggest that IFT88 and IFT20 interact with YAP1 in the cytoplasm and functionally modulate its activity, identifying a molecular link between cilia-related proteins and the Hippo pathway. Taken together, our results highlight a noncanonical role for IFT complex B proteins during cardiogenesis and shed light on a mechanism of action for ciliary proteins in YAP1 regulation."	0
"32220646"	"Cryo-EM Structures of Human Drosha and DGCR8 in Complex with Primary MicroRNA.Metazoan microRNAs require specific maturation steps initiated by Microprocessor, comprising Drosha and DGCR8. Lack of structural information for the assembled complex has hindered an understanding of how Microprocessor recognizes primary microRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Here we present a cryoelectron microscopy structure of human Microprocessor with a pri-miRNA docked in the active site, poised for cleavage. The basal junction is recognized by a four-way intramolecular junction in Drosha, triggered by the Belt and Wedge regions that clamp over the ssRNA. The belt is important for efficiency and accuracy of pri-miRNA processing. Two dsRBDs form a molecular ruler to measure the stem length between the two dsRNA-ssRNA junctions. The specific organization of the dsRBDs near the apical junction is independent of Drosha core domains, as observed in a second structure in the partially docked state. Collectively, we derive a molecular model to explain how Microprocessor recognizes a pri-miRNA and accurately identifies the cleavage site."	0

However, these methods are technically challenging and not easily applicable to an in vivo setting. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele. We demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of this method in mouse embryonic stem cells, developing embryos, adult tissues, and autochthonous mouse models of human brain and lung cancers. This method and the datasets we have generated will facilitate the characterization of miRNA-mRNA networks in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions."	0
"32719553"	"Cell stretching is amplified by active actin remodelling to deform and recruit proteins in mechanosensitive structures.Detection and conversion of mechanical forces into biochemical signals controls cell functions during physiological and pathological processes. Mechanosensing is based on protein deformations and reorganizations, yet the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Using a cell-stretching device compatible with super-resolution microscopy and single-protein tracking, we explored the nanoscale deformations and reorganizations of individual proteins inside mechanosensitive structures. We achieved super-resolution microscopy after live stretching on intermediate filaments, microtubules and integrin adhesions. Simultaneous single-protein tracking and stretching showed that while integrins followed the elastic deformation of the substrate, actin filaments and talin also displayed lagged and transient inelastic responses associated with active acto-myosin remodelling and talin deformations. Capturing acute reorganizations of single molecules during stretching showed that force-dependent vinculin recruitment is delayed and depends on the maturation of integrin adhesions. Thus, cells respond to external forces by amplifying transiently and locally cytoskeleton displacements, enabling protein deformation and recruitment in mechanosensitive structures."	0

"32075766"	"A High-Throughput Screening Identifies MICU1 Targeting Compounds.Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake depends on the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, a highly selective channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Here, we screen a library of 44,000 non-proprietary compounds for their ability to modulate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Two of them, named MCU-i4 and MCU-i11, are confirmed to reliably decrease mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Docking simulations reveal that these molecules directly bind a specific cleft in MICU1, a key element of the MCU complex that controls channel gating. Accordingly, in MICU1-silenced or deleted cells, the inhibitory effect of the two compounds is lost. Moreover, MCU-i4 and MCU-i11 fail to inhibit mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in cells expressing a MICU1 mutated in the critical amino acids that forge the predicted binding cleft. Finally, these compounds are tested ex vivo, revealing a primary role for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in muscle growth. Overall, MCU-i4 and MCU-i11 represent leading molecules for the development of MICU1-targeting drugs."	0
"32187551"	"Mesenchymal Stem and Stromal Cells Harness Macrophage-Derived Amphiregulin to Maintain Tissue Homeostasis.The cross-talk between mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (MSCs) and macrophages is critical for the restoration of tissue homeostasis after injury. Here, we demonstrate a pathway through which MSCs instruct macrophages to resolve inflammation and preserve tissue-specific stem cells, leading to homeostasis in mice with autoimmune uveoretinitis and sterile-injury-induced corneal epithelial stem cell deficiency. Distinct from their conventional role in macrophage reprogramming to anti-inflammatory phenotype by a PGE2-dependent mechanism, MSCs enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages, which partly depends on the uptake of MSC mitochondria-containing extracellular vesicles. The MSC-primed macrophages increase the secretion of amphiregulin (AREG) in a phagocytosis-dependent manner. AREG is essential for MSC-primed macrophages to suppress immune responses through regulatory T (Treg) cells and to protect corneal epithelial stem cells via apoptosis inhibition and proliferation promotion. Hence, the data reveal that MSCs harness macrophage-derived AREG to maintain tissue homeostasis after injury and provide a therapeutic target in immune-mediated disease and regenerative medicine."	0
"32460023"	"Prophase-Specific Perinuclear Actin Coordinates Centrosome Separation and Positioning to Ensure Accurate Chromosome Segregation.Centrosome separation in late G2/ early prophase requires precise spatial coordination that is determined by a balance of forces promoting and antagonizing separation. The major effector of centrosome separation is the kinesin Eg5. However, the identity and regulation of Eg5-antagonizing forces is less well characterized. By manipulating candidate components, we find that centrosome separation is reversible and that separated centrosomes congress toward a central position underneath the flat nucleus. This positioning mechanism requires microtubule polymerization, as well as actin polymerization. We identify perinuclear actin structures that form in late G2/early prophase and interact with microtubules emanating from the centrosomes. Disrupting these structures by breaking the interactions of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex with perinuclear actin filaments abrogates this centrosome positioning mechanism and causes an increase in subsequent chromosome segregation errors. Our results demonstrate how geometrical cues from the cell nucleus coordinate the orientation of the emanating spindle poles before nuclear envelope breakdown."	0
"32320647"	"Dopaminergic Control of Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Underlies Cocaine-Induced Psychostimulation.Cocaine drastically elevates dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, a brain region that is critical to the psychomotor and rewarding properties of the drug. DA signaling regulates intrastriatal circuits connecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) with afferent fibers and interneurons. While the cocaine-mediated increase in DA signaling on MSNs is well documented, that on cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) has been more difficult to assess. Using combined pharmacological, chemogenetic, and cell-specific ablation approaches, we reveal that the D2R-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is fundamental to cocaine-induced changes in behavior and the striatal genomic response. We show that the D2R-dependent control of striatal ChIs enables the motor, sensitized, and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This study highlights the importance of the DA- and D2R-mediated inhibitory control of ChIs activity in the normal functioning of striatal networks."	0
"32698001"	"Acquisition and Adaptation of Ultra-small Parasitic Reduced Genome Bacteria to Mammalian Hosts.The first cultivated representative of the enigmatic phylum Saccharibacteria (formerly TM7) was isolated from humans and revealed an ultra-small cell size (200-300 nm), a reduced genome with limited biosynthetic capabilities, and a unique parasitic lifestyle. TM7x was the only cultivated member of the candidate phyla radiation (CPR), estimated to encompass 26% of the domain Bacteria. Here we report on divergent genomes from major lineages across the Saccharibacteria phylum in humans and mammals, as well as from ancient dental calculus. These lineages are present at high prevalence within hosts. Direct imaging reveals that all groups are ultra-small in size, likely feeding off commensal bacteria. Analyses suggest that multiple acquisition events in the past led to the current wide diversity, with convergent evolution of key functions allowing Saccharibacteria from the environment to adapt to mammals. Ultra-small, parasitic CPR bacteria represent a relatively unexplored paradigm of prokaryotic interactions within mammalian microbiomes."	0
"32375049"	"Variation of Human Neural Stem Cells Generating Organizer States In Vitro before Committing to Cortical Excitatory or Inhibitory Neuronal Fates.Better understanding of the progression of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing cerebral cortex is important for modeling neurogenesis and defining the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we use RNA sequencing, cell imaging, and lineage tracing of mouse and human in vitro NSCs and monkey brain sections to model the generation of cortical neuronal fates. We show that conserved signaling mechanisms regulate the acute transition from proliferative NSCs to committed glutamatergic excitatory neurons. As human telencephalic NSCs develop from pluripotency in vitro, they transition through organizer states that spatially pattern the cortex before generating glutamatergic precursor fates. NSCs derived from multiple human pluripotent lines vary in these early patterning states, leading differentially to dorsal or ventral telencephalic fates. This work furthers systematic analyses of the earliest patterning events that generate the major neuronal trajectories of the human telencephalon."	0
"32348752"	"The Mitochondrial Import Complex MIM Functions as Main Translocase for α-Helical Outer Membrane Proteins.The mitochondrial outer membrane contains integral proteins with α-helical membrane anchors or a transmembrane β-barrel. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) cooperates with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) in the import of β-barrel proteins, whereas the mitochondrial import (MIM) complex inserts precursors of multi-spanning α-helical proteins. Single-spanning proteins constitute more than half of the integral outer membrane proteins; however, their biogenesis is poorly understood. We report that the yeast MIM complex promotes the insertion of proteins with N-terminal (signal-anchored) or C-terminal (tail-anchored) membrane anchors. The MIM complex exists in three dynamic populations. MIM interacts with TOM to accept precursor proteins from the receptor Tom70. Free MIM complexes insert single-spanning proteins that are imported in a Tom70-independent manner. Finally, coupling of MIM and SAM promotes early assembly steps of TOM subunits. We conclude that the MIM complex is a major and versatile protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane."	0
"32675283"	"Maintenance of hook complex integrity and centrin arm assembly facilitates flagellum inheritance in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>.Inheritance of the newly assembled flagellum in the human parasite <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> depends on the faithful duplication and segregation of multiple flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures, including the hook complex and its associated centrin arm. The biological functions of this unique hook complex-centrin arm assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we report a hook complex-associated protein named BOH2 that plays an essential role in promoting flagellum inheritance. BOH2 localizes to the hooked part of the hook complex by bridging the hook complex, the centrin arm, and the flagellum attachment zone filament. Depletion of BOH2 caused the loss of the shank part of the hook complex and its associated protein TbSmee1, disrupted the assembly of the centrin arm and the recruitment of centrin arm-associated protein CAAP1, inhibited the assembly of the flagellum attachment zone, and caused flagellum mispositioning and detachment. These results demonstrate crucial roles of BOH2 in maintaining hook complex integrity and promoting centrin arm formation and suggest that proper assembly of the hook complex-centrin arm structure facilitates flagellum inheritance."	0

HIV infection in adults depletes circulating ILCs, but the impact on children infected from birth remains unknown. We study vertically HIV-infected children from birth to adulthood and find severe and persistent depletion of all circulating ILCs that, unlike CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, are not restored by long-term antiretroviral therapy unless initiated at birth. Remaining ILCs upregulate genes associated with cellular activation and metabolic perturbation. Unlike HIV-infected adults, ILCs are also profoundly depleted in tonsils of vertically infected children. Transcriptional profiling of remaining ILCs reveals ongoing cell-type-specific activity despite antiretroviral therapy. Collectively, these data suggest an important and ongoing role for ILCs in lymphoid tissue of HIV-infected children from birth, where persistent depletion and sustained transcriptional activity are likely to have long-term immune consequences that merit further investigation."	0
"31375262"	"Heterozygous Mutations in SMARCA2 Reprogram the Enhancer Landscape by Global Retargeting of SMARCA4.Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complexes associated with an ATPase (either SMARCA4 or SMARCA2). Heterozygous mutations in the SMARCA2 ATPase cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), an intellectual disability syndrome associated with delayed speech onset. We engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to carry NCBRS-associated heterozygous SMARCA2 K755R or R1159Q mutations. While SMARCA2 mutant hESCs were phenotypically normal, differentiation to neural progenitors cells (NPCs) was severely impaired. We find that SMARCA2 mutations cause enhancer reorganization with loss of SOX3-dependent neural enhancers and prominent emergence of astrocyte-specific de novo enhancers. Changes in chromatin accessibility at enhancers were associated with an increase in SMARCA2 binding and retargeting of SMARCA4. We show that the AP-1 family member FRA2 is aberrantly overexpressed in SMARCA2 mutant NPCs, where it functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers. Together, our results demonstrate that SMARCA2 mutations cause impaired differentiation through enhancer reprogramming via inappropriate targeting of SMARCA4."	0

"32369734"	"Cryo-EM Structure of the Fork Protection Complex Bound to CMG at a Replication Fork.The eukaryotic replisome, organized around the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, orchestrates chromosome replication. Multiple factors associate directly with CMG, including Ctf4 and the heterotrimeric fork protection complex (Csm3/Tof1 and Mrc1), which has important roles including aiding normal replication rates and stabilizing stalled forks. How these proteins interface with CMG to execute these functions is poorly understood. Here we present 3 to 3.5 Å resolution electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures comprising CMG, Ctf4, and the fork protection complex at a replication fork. The structures provide high-resolution views of CMG-DNA interactions, revealing a mechanism for strand separation, and show Csm3/Tof1 ""grip"" duplex DNA ahead of CMG via a network of interactions important for efficient replication fork pausing. Although Mrc1 was not resolved in our structures, we determine its topology in the replisome by cross-linking mass spectrometry. Collectively, our work reveals how four highly conserved replisome components collaborate with CMG to facilitate replisome progression and maintain genome stability."	0
"32075770"	"Opposite Control of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapse Formation by Slitrk2 and Slitrk5 on Dopamine Neurons Modulates Hyperactivity Behavior.The neurodevelopmental origin of hyperactivity disorder has been suggested to involve the dopaminergic system, but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Here, transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b are shown to be essential for midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron excitatory synaptic inputs and dendritic development. Strikingly, conditional knockout (cKO) of Lmx1a/b in postmitotic mDA neurons results in marked hyperactivity. In seeking Lmx1a/b target genes, we identify positively regulated Slitrk2 and negatively regulated Slitrk5. These two synaptic adhesion proteins promote excitatory and inhibitory synapses on mDA neurons, respectively. Knocking down Slitrk2 reproduces some of the Lmx1a/b cKO cellular and behavioral phenotypes, whereas Slitrk5 knockdown has opposite effects. The hyperactivity caused by this imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs on dopamine neurons is reproduced by chronically inhibiting the ventral tegmental area during development using pharmacogenetics. Our study shows that alterations in developing dopaminergic circuits strongly impact locomotor activity, shedding light on mechanisms causing hyperactivity behaviors."	0

"31078384"	"The Cardiac Ryanodine Receptor Phosphorylation Hotspot Embraces PKA in a Phosphorylation-Dependent Manner.Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels controlling essential cellular functions. RyRs are targeted by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), a controversial regulation implicated in disorders ranging from heart failure to Alzheimer's. Using crystal structures, we show that the phosphorylation hotspot domain of RyR2 embraces the PKA catalytic subunit, with an extensive interface not seen in PKA complexes with peptides. We trapped an intermediary open-form PKA bound to the RyR2 domain and an ATP analog, showing that PKA can engage substrates in an open form. Phosphomimetics or prior phosphorylation at nearby sites in RyR2 either enhance or reduce the activity of PKA. Finally, we show that a phosphomimetic at S2813, a well-known target site for calmodulin-dependent kinase II, induces the formation of an alpha helix in the phosphorylation domain, resulting in increased interactions and PKA activity. This shows that the different phosphorylation sites in RyR2 are not independent."	0

We use bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to distinguish the transcriptional signature of prospectively isolated granulosa and theca/stroma cell subsets within human antral follicles derived from xenografts or ovaries. The analysis deconstructs phenotypic diversification within small (<4 mm) antral follicles, identifying secreted factors that are differentially enriched between mural and oophorus granulosa cells, and segregating stromal/support and steroidal activity between theca externa and interna, respectively. Multiple factors are differentially expressed in follicles of xenograft versus ovarian origin.

"31006537"	"TEX264 Is an Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident ATG8-Interacting Protein Critical for ER Remodeling during Nutrient Stress.Cells respond to nutrient stress by trafficking cytosolic contents to lysosomes for degradation via macroautophagy. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an initiation site for autophagosomes and is also remodeled in response to nutrient stress through ER-phagy, a form of selective autophagy. Quantitative proteome analysis during nutrient stress identified an unstudied single-pass transmembrane ER protein, TEX264, as an ER-phagy receptor. TEX264 uses an LC3-interacting region (LIR) to traffic into ATG8-positive puncta that often initiate from three-way ER tubule junctions and subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Interaction and proximity biotinylation proteomics identified a cohort of autophagy regulatory proteins and cargo adaptors located near TEX264 in an LIR-dependent manner. Global proteomics and ER-phagy flux analysis revealed the stabilization of a cohort of ER proteins in TEX264<sup>-/-</sup> cells during nutrient stress. This work reveals TEX264 as an unrecognized ER-phagy receptor that acts independently of other candidate ER-phagy receptors to remodel the ER during nutrient stress."	0
"32755575"	"Immune Monitoring Reveals Fusion Peptide Priming to Imprint Cross-Clade HIV-Neutralizing Responses with a Characteristic Early B Cell Signature.The HIV fusion peptide (FP) is a promising vaccine target. FP-directed monoclonal antibodies from vaccinated macaques have been identified that neutralize up to ∼60% of HIV strains; these vaccinations, however, have involved ∼1 year with an extended neutralization-eclipse phase without measurable serum neutralization. Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth ∼1 year later. Immune monitoring of B cells in response to vaccination can thus enable vaccine insights even in the absence of serum neutralization, here identifying FP imprinting, cocktail approach, and early signature as means to improve FP-directed vaccine responses."	0
"32155413"	"NELF Regulates a Promoter-Proximal Step Distinct from RNA Pol II Pause-Release.RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is generally paused at promoter-proximal regions in most metazoans, and based on in vitro studies, this function has been attributed to the negative elongation factor (NELF). Here, we show that upon rapid depletion of NELF, RNA Pol II fails to be released into gene bodies, stopping instead around the +1 nucleosomal dyad-associated region. The transition to the 2nd pause region is independent of positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. During the heat shock response, RNA Pol II is rapidly released from pausing at heat shock-induced genes, while most genes are paused and transcriptionally downregulated. Both of these aspects of the heat shock response remain intact upon NELF loss. We find that NELF depletion results in global loss of cap-binding complex from chromatin without global reduction of nascent transcript 5' cap stability. Thus, our studies implicate NELF functioning in early elongation complexes distinct from RNA Pol II pause-release."	0
"30738704"	"Dual Role of Mitochondrial Porin in Metabolite Transport across the Outer Membrane and Protein Transfer to the Inner Membrane.The mitochondrial inner membrane harbors a large number of metabolite carriers. The precursors of carrier proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the carrier translocase of the inner membrane (TIM22). Molecular chaperones in the cytosol and intermembrane space bind to the hydrophobic precursors to prevent their aggregation. We report that the major metabolite channel of the outer membrane, termed porin or voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), promotes efficient import of carrier precursors. Porin interacts with carrier precursors arriving in the intermembrane space and recruits TIM22 complexes, thus ensuring an efficient transfer of the precursors to the inner membrane translocase. Porin channel mutants impaired in metabolite transport are not disturbed in carrier import into mitochondria. We conclude that porin serves distinct functions as outer membrane channel for metabolites and as coupling factor for protein translocation into the inner membrane."	0

"32451440"	"Extracellular serine controls epidermal stem cell fate and tumour initiation.Tissue stem cells are the cell of origin for many malignancies. Metabolites regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, but whether endogenous metabolic pathways or nutrient availability predispose stem cells towards transformation remains unknown. Here, we address this question in epidermal stem cells (EpdSCs), which are a cell of origin for squamous cell carcinoma. We find that oncogenic EpdSCs are serine auxotrophs whose growth and self-renewal require abundant exogenous serine. When extracellular serine is limited, EpdSCs activate de novo serine synthesis, which in turn stimulates α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that remove the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 and activate differentiation programmes. Accordingly, serine starvation or enforced α-ketoglutarate production antagonizes squamous cell carcinoma growth. Conversely, blocking serine synthesis or repressing α-ketoglutarate-driven demethylation facilitates malignant progression. Together, these findings reveal that extracellular serine is a critical determinant of EpdSC fate and provide insight into how nutrient availability is integrated with stem cell fate decisions during tumour initiation."	0

We employed metabolic small RNA sequencing for a comprehensive view on intracellular microRNA kinetics in Drosophila. Based on absolute rate of biogenesis and decay, microRNAs rank among the fastest produced and longest-lived cellular transcripts, disposing up to 10<sup>5</sup> copies per cell at steady-state. Mature microRNAs are produced within minutes, revealing tight intracellular coupling of biogenesis that is selectively disrupted by pre-miRNA-uridylation. Control over Argonaute protein homeostasis generates a kinetic bottleneck that cooperates with non-coding RNA surveillance to ensure faithful microRNA loading. Finally, regulated small RNA decay enables the selective rapid turnover of Ago1-bound microRNAs, but not of Ago2-bound small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), reflecting key differences in the robustness of small RNA silencing pathways.

It has been implicated in cancer and the Alazami syndrome, a severe developmental disorder. Here, we report a so far unknown role of this protein in RNA modification. We show that LARP7 physically connects the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) with a distinct subset of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guiding U6 2'-O-methylation. Consistently, these modifications are severely compromised in the absence of LARP7. Although general splicing remains largely unaffected, transcriptome-wide analysis revealed perturbations in alternative splicing in LARP7-depleted cells. Importantly, we identified defects in 2'-O-methylation of the U6 snRNA in Alazami syndrome siblings carrying a LARP7 mutation. Our data identify LARP7 as a bridging factor for snoRNA-guided modification of the U6 snRNA and suggest that alterations in splicing fidelity contribute to the etiology of the Alazami syndrome."	1
"30709710"	"A Functional Mini-Integrase in a Two-Protein-type V-C CRISPR System.CRISPR-Cas immunity requires integration of short, foreign DNA fragments into the host genome at the CRISPR locus, a site consisting of alternating repeat sequences and foreign-derived spacers. In most CRISPR systems, the proteins Cas1 and Cas2 form the integration complex and are both essential for DNA acquisition. Most type V-C and V-D systems lack the cas2 gene and have unusually short CRISPR repeats and spacers. Here, we show that a mini-integrase comprising the type V-C Cas1 protein alone catalyzes DNA integration with a preference for short (17- to 19-base-pair) DNA fragments. The mini-integrase has weak specificity for the CRISPR array. We present evidence that the Cas1 proteins form a tetramer for integration. Our findings support a model of a minimal integrase with an internal ruler mechanism that favors shorter repeats and spacers. This minimal integrase may represent the function of the ancestral Cas1 prior to Cas2 adoption."	0

However, the mechanisms that regulate the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins are poorly understood. We have previously shown that the DUB ubiquitin-specific protease 46 (USP-46) removes ubiquitin from the glutamate receptor GLR-1 and regulates its trafficking and degradation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> We found that the WD40-repeat proteins WDR-20 and WDR-48 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of USP-46.

Together, these results support a model in which WDR-48 binds and stabilizes USP-46 protein levels by preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of USP-46 in the proteasome. Given that a large number of USPs interact with WDR proteins, we propose that stabilization of DUBs by their interacting WDR proteins may be a conserved and widely used mechanism that controls DUB availability and function."	1
"32521275"	"TBC1D5-Catalyzed Cycling of Rab7 Is Required for Retromer-Mediated Human Papillomavirus Trafficking during Virus Entry.During virus entry, human papillomaviruses are sorted by the cellular trafficking complex, called retromer, into the retrograde transport pathway to traffic from the endosome to downstream cellular compartments, but regulation of retromer activity during HPV entry is poorly understood. Here we selected artificial proteins that modulate cellular proteins required for HPV infection and discovered that entry requires TBC1D5, a retromer-associated, Rab7-specific GTPase-activating protein. Binding of retromer to the HPV L2 capsid protein recruits TBC1D5 to retromer at the endosome membrane, which then stimulates hydrolysis of Rab7-GTP to drive retromer disassembly from HPV and delivery of HPV to the retrograde pathway. Although the cellular retromer cargos CIMPR and DMT1-II require only GTP-bound Rab7 for trafficking, HPV trafficking requires cycling between GTP- and GDP-bound Rab7. Thus, ongoing cargo-induced membrane recruitment, assembly, and disassembly of retromer complexes drive HPV trafficking."	0

"32268085"	"Loss of Thymine DNA Glycosylase Causes Dysregulation of Bile Acid Homeostasis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that plays an essential role in the maintenance of epigenetic stability in cells. Here, we demonstrate that the conditional deletion of TDG in adult mice results in a male-predominant onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TDG loss leads to a prediabetic state, as well as bile acid (BA) accumulation in the liver and serum of male mice. Consistent with these data, TDG deletion led to dysregulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulatory cascade in the liver. FXR and SHP are tumor suppressors of HCC and play an essential role in BA and glucose homeostasis. These results indicate that TDG functions as a tumor suppressor of HCC by regulating a transcriptional program that protects against the development of glucose intolerance and BA accumulation in the liver."	0
"32433955"	"Optogenetic Activation of Striatopallidal Neurons Reveals Altered HCN Gating in DYT1 Dystonia.Firing activity of external globus pallidus (GPe) is crucial for motor control and is severely perturbed in dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions. Here, we show that GPe projection neurons exhibit a reduction of firing frequency and an irregular pattern in a DYT1 dystonia model. Optogenetic activation of the striatopallidal pathway fails to reset pacemaking activity of GPe neurons in mutant mice. Abnormal firing is paralleled by alterations in motor learning. We find that loss of dopamine D2 receptor-dependent inhibition causes increased GABA input at striatopallidal synapses, with subsequent downregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. Accordingly, enhancing in vivo HCN channel activity or blocking GABA release restores both the ability of striatopallidal inputs to pause ongoing GPe activity and motor coordination deficits. Our findings demonstrate an impaired striatopallidal connectivity, supporting the central role of GPe in motor control and, more importantly, identifying potential pharmacological targets for dystonia."	0
"31564557"	"Targeting Spt5-Pol II by Small-Molecule Inhibitors Uncouples Distinct Activities and Reveals Additional Regulatory Roles.Spt5 is a conserved and essential transcription elongation factor that promotes promoter-proximal pausing, promoter escape, elongation, and mRNA processing. Spt5 plays specific roles in the transcription of inflammation and stress-induced genes and tri-nucleotide expanded-repeat genes involved in inherited neurological pathologies. Here, we report the identification of Spt5-Pol II small-molecule inhibitors (SPIs). SPIs faithfully reproduced Spt5 knockdown effects on promoter-proximal pausing, NF-κB activation, and expanded-repeat huntingtin gene transcription. Using SPIs, we identified Spt5 target genes that responded with profoundly diverse kinetics. SPIs uncovered the regulatory role of Spt5 in metabolism via GDF15, a food intake- and body weight-inhibitory hormone. SPIs further unveiled a role for Spt5 in promoting the 3' end processing of histone genes. While several SPIs affect all Spt5 functions, a few inhibit a single one, implying uncoupling and selective targeting of Spt5 activities. SPIs expand the understanding of Spt5-Pol II functions and are potential drugs against metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases."	0

The presence of BAT/BAT-like tissue in humans renders BAT as an attractive target against obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we identify Aifm2, a NADH oxidoreductase domain containing flavoprotein, as a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein highly enriched in BAT. Aifm2 is induced by cold as well as by diet. Upon cold or β-adrenergic stimulation, Aifm2 associates with the outer side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a unique BAT-specific first mammalian NDE (external NADH dehydrogenase)-like enzyme, Aifm2 oxidizes NADH to maintain high cytosolic NAD levels in supporting robust glycolysis and to transfer electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) for fueling thermogenesis. Aifm2 in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) promotes oxygen consumption, uncoupled respiration, and heat production during cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. Aifm2, thus, can ameliorate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance."	0

Based on previous work showing a decreasing PA gradient along the longitudinal axis of the rodent hippocampus, we asked whether the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and the ventral hippocampus (VH) are differentially affected by PA modulation. Here, we show that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is a major hippocampal PA source, compared to PLD2, and that PLD1 ablation affects predominantly the lipidome of the DH. Moreover, Pld1 knockout (KO) mice show specific deficits in novel object recognition and social interaction and disruption in the DH-VH dendritic arborization differentiation in CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons. Also, Pld1 KO animals present reduced long-term depression (LTD) induction and reduced GluN2A and SNAP-25 protein levels in the DH.

"32814044"	"Vesicular Glutamate Transporter Expression Ensures High-Fidelity Synaptic Transmission at the Calyx of Held Synapses.Recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at presynaptic terminals is required for sustained neurotransmitter release. Although SV endocytosis is a rate-limiting step for synaptic transmission, it is unclear whether the rate of the subsequent SV refilling with neurotransmitter also influences synaptic transmission. By analyzing vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1)-deficient calyx of Held synapses, in which both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are co-expressed in wild-type situation, we found that VGLUT1 loss causes a drastic reduction in SV refilling rate down to ∼25% of wild-type values, with only subtle changes in basic synaptic parameters. Strikingly, VGLUT1-deficient synapses exhibited abnormal synaptic failures within a few seconds during high-frequency repetitive firing, which was recapitulated by manipulating presynaptic Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations to retard SV refilling. Our data show that the speed of SV refilling can be rate limiting for synaptic transmission under certain conditions that entail reduced VGLUT levels during development as well as various neuropathological processes."	0
"32532816"	"The RNA-binding protein Hfq assembles into foci-like structures in nitrogen starved <i>Escherichia coli</i>.The initial adaptive responses to nutrient depletion in bacteria often occur at the level of gene expression. Hfq is an RNA-binding protein present in diverse bacterial lineages that contributes to many different aspects of RNA metabolism during gene expression. Using photoactivated localization microscopy and single-molecule tracking, we demonstrate that Hfq forms a distinct and reversible focus-like structure in <i>Escherichia coli</i> specifically experiencing long-term nitrogen starvation. Using the ability of T7 phage to replicate in nitrogen-starved bacteria as a biological probe of <i>E. coli</i> cell function during nitrogen starvation, we demonstrate that Hfq foci have a role in the adaptive response of <i>E. coli</i> to long-term nitrogen starvation. We further show that Hfq foci formation does not depend on gene expression once nitrogen starvation has set in and occurs indepen-dently of the transcription factor N-regulatory protein C, which activates the initial adaptive response to N starvation in <i>E. coli</i> These results serve as a paradigm to demonstrate that bacterial adaptation to long-term nutrient starvation can be spatiotemporally coordinated and can occur independently of <i>de novo</i> gene expression during starvation."	0

"32101744"	"Adaptive Evolution Targets a piRNA Precursor Transcription Network.In Drosophila, transposon-silencing piRNAs are derived from heterochromatic clusters and a subset of euchromatic transposon insertions, which are bound by the Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to Deadlock, which recruits TRF2 to promote non-canonical transcription from both genomic strands. Cuff function is less well understood, but this Rai1 homolog shows hallmarks of adaptive evolution, which can remodel functional interactions within host defense systems. Supporting this hypothesis, Drosophila simulans Cutoff is a dominant-negative allele when expressed in Drosophila melanogaster, in which it traps Deadlock, TRF2, and the conserved transcriptional co-repressor CtBP in stable complexes. Cutoff functions with Rhino and Deadlock to drive non-canonical transcription. In contrast, CtBP suppresses canonical transcription of transposons and promoters flanking the major germline clusters, and canonical transcription interferes with downstream non-canonical transcription and piRNA production. Adaptive evolution thus targets interactions among Cutoff, TRF2, and CtBP that balance canonical and non-canonical piRNA precursor transcription."	0
"32111741"	"The Parkinson's disease-associated kinase LRRK2 regulates genes required for cell adhesion, polarization, and chemotaxis in activated murine macrophages.Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) encodes a complex protein that includes kinase and GTPase domains. Genome-wide association studies have identified dominant <i>LRRK2</i> alleles that predispose their carriers to late-onset idiotypic Parkinson's disease (PD) and also to autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease. Considerable evidence indicates that PD initiation and progression involve activation of innate immune functions in microglia, which are brain-resident macrophages. Here we asked whether LRRK2 modifies inflammatory signaling and how this modification might contribute to PD and Crohn's disease. We used RNA-Seq-based high-resolution transcriptomics to compare gene expression in activated primary macrophages derived from WT and <i>Lrrk2</i> knockout mice. Remarkably, expression of a single gene, Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (<i>Rapgef3</i>), was strongly up-regulated in the absence of LRRK2 and down-regulated in its presence. We observed similar regulation of <i>Rapgef3</i> expression in cells treated with a highly specific inhibitor of LRRK2 protein kinase activity. <i>Rapgef3</i> encodes an exchange protein, activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC-1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the small GTPase Rap-1. Rap-1 mediates cell adhesion, polarization, and directional motility, and our results indicate that LRRK2 modulates chemotaxis of microglia and macrophages. Dominant PD-associated <i>LRRK2</i> alleles may suppress EPAC-1 activity, further restricting motility and preventing efficient migration of microglia to sites of neuronal damage. Functional analysis <i>in vivo</i> in a subclinical infection model also indicated that Lrrk2 subtly modifies the inflammatory response. These results indicate that LRRK2 modulates the expression of genes involved in murine immune cell chemotaxis."	1
"32937133"	"Functional Dissection of Basal Ganglia Inhibitory Inputs onto Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons.Substantia nigra (SNc) dopaminergic neurons respond to aversive stimuli with inhibitory pauses in firing followed by transient rebound activation. We tested integration of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto SNc neurons from genetically defined populations in dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and external globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin- and Lhx6-positive), and examined their contribution to pause-rebound firing. Activation of striosome projections, which target ""dendron bouquets"" in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound."	0

We find that miR-451, which derives from a hairpin with a suboptimal terminal loop and a suboptimal stem length, accumulates to 40-fold higher levels when clustered with a helper hairpin. This phenomenon tolerates changes in hairpin order, linker lengths, and the identities of the helper hairpin, the recipient hairpin, the linker-sequence, and the RNA polymerase that transcribes the hairpins. It can act reciprocally and need not occur co-transcriptionally. It requires Microprocessor recognition of the helper hairpin and linkage of the two hairpins, yet predominantly manifests after helper-hairpin processing.

RJ treatment also reportedly protects against bone loss, but no single factor in RJ has yet been identified as an anti-osteoporosis agent. Here we fractionated RJ and identified 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA) as a key component involved in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis based on mass spectrometric analysis. We further demonstrated free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) as directly interacting with 10H2DA; binding of 10H2DA to FFAR4 on osteoclasts inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced activation of NF-κB signaling, thereby attenuating the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1, a key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. Oral administration of 10H2DA attenuated bone resorption in ovariectomized mice. These results suggest a potential therapeutic approach of targeting osteoclast differentiation by the supplementation of RJ, and specifically 10H2DA, in cases of pathological bone loss such as occur in postmenopausal osteoporosis."	1

Here we report the surprising result that visual experience is critical for the alignment of vDSGC dendrites to their preferred direction. Interestingly, vDSGCs in dark-reared mice lose their inhibition-independent dendritic contribution to direction-selective tuning while maintaining asymmetric inhibitory input.

We previously reported that differential degradation of TKI-sensitive (<i>e.g.</i> L858R) and resistant (T790M) EGFR mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. We also reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> ubiquitination assays, MS, and superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of EGF-bound EGFR, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown increases receptor sorting to lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas <i>SMURF2</i> knockdown decreased EGFR steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive target to overcome TKI resistance."	1

Morphological analyses of NvPOU4 mutants crossed to transgenic reporter lines show that the loss of NvPOU4 does not affect the initial specification of neural cells. Transcriptomes derived from the mutants and from different neural cell populations reveal that NvPOU4 is required for the execution of the terminal differentiation program of these neural cells.

Here, we report that Armitage (Armi), an RNA-binding ATPase localized to both nuage and mitochondria, links the ping-pong cycle to the phased piRNA pathway. Mutations that block phased piRNA production deplete Armi from nuage. Armi ATPase mutants cannot support phased piRNA production and inappropriately bind mRNA instead of piRNA precursors.

Here, we generate mutant human embryonic stem cell lines (Mut hESCs) carrying an NR2F1-R112K mutation that has been identified in a patient with ASD features and investigate their neurodevelopmental alterations. Mut hESCs overproduce ventral telencephalic neuron progenitors (ventral NPCs) and underproduce dorsal NPCs, causing the imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurons. These alterations can be mainly attributed to the aberrantly activated Hedgehog signaling pathway. Moreover, the corresponding Nr2f1 point-mutant mice display a similar excitatory/inhibitory neuron imbalance and abnormal behaviors.

Functionally, Spic downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes iron efflux by regulating ferroportin expression in activated macrophages. Notably, interferon-gamma blocks Spic expression in a STAT1-dependent manner. High levels of interferon-gamma are indicative of ongoing infection, and in its absence, activated macrophages appear to engage a ""default"" Spic-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway.

Single-turnover experiments of this reduced CntB species indicated the translocation of the first electron onto the [Fe] center and the second electron onto the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntA to finally allow for oxygen activation as a basis for carnitine cleavage. EPR spectroscopic investigation of CntA variants indicated an unusual intermolecular electron transfer between the subunits of the CntA trimer <i>via</i> the ""bridging"" residue Glu-205.

"31519520"	"Transcription Factor-Directed Re-wiring of Chromatin Architecture for Somatic Cell Nuclear Reprogramming toward trans-Differentiation.MYOD-directed fibroblast trans-differentiation into skeletal muscle provides a unique model to investigate how one transcription factor (TF) reconfigures the three-dimensional chromatin architecture to control gene expression, which is otherwise achieved by the combinatorial activities of multiple TFs. Integrative analysis of genome-wide high-resolution chromatin interactions, MYOD and CTCF DNA-binding profile, and gene expression, revealed that MYOD directs extensive re-wiring of interactions involving cis-regulatory and structural genomic elements, including promoters, enhancers, and insulated neighborhoods (INs). Re-configured INs were hot-spots of differential interactions, whereby MYOD binding to highly constrained sequences at IN boundaries and/or inside INs led to alterations of promoter-enhancer interactions to repress cell-of-origin genes and to activate muscle-specific genes. Functional evidence shows that MYOD-directed re-configuration of chromatin interactions temporally preceded the effect on gene expression and was mediated by direct MYOD-DNA binding. These data illustrate a model whereby a single TF alters multi-loop hubs to drive somatic cell trans-differentiation."	0
"31883950"	"PRC1 Catalytic Activity Is Central to Polycomb System Function.The Polycomb repressive system is an essential chromatin-based regulator of gene expression. Despite being extensively studied, how the Polycomb system selects its target genes is poorly understood, and whether its histone-modifying activities are required for transcriptional repression remains controversial. Here, we directly test the requirement for PRC1 catalytic activity in Polycomb system function. To achieve this, we develop a conditional mutation system in embryonic stem cells that completely removes PRC1 catalytic activity. Using this system, we demonstrate that catalysis by PRC1 drives Polycomb chromatin domain formation and long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show that variant PRC1 complexes with DNA-binding activities occupy target sites independently of PRC1 catalytic activity, providing a putative mechanism for Polycomb target site selection. Finally, we discover that Polycomb-mediated gene repression requires PRC1 catalytic activity. Together these discoveries provide compelling evidence that PRC1 catalysis is central to Polycomb system function and gene regulation."	0
"32101745"	"Dense Transposon Integration Reveals Essential Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors Promote Heterochromatin Formation.Heterochromatin functions as a scaffold for factors responsible for gene silencing and chromosome segregation. Heterochromatin can be assembled by multiple pathways, including RNAi and RNA surveillance. We identified factors that form heterochromatin using dense profiles of transposable element integration in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The candidates include a large number of essential proteins such as four canonical mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors. We find that Iss1, a subunit of the poly(A) polymerase module, plays a role in forming heterochromatin in centromere repeats that is independent of RNAi. Genome-wide maps reveal that Iss1 accumulates at genes regulated by RNA surveillance. Iss1 interacts with RNA surveillance factors Mmi1 and Rrp6, and importantly, Iss1 contributes to RNA elimination that forms heterochromatin at meiosis genes. Our profile of transposable element integration supports the model that a network of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors coordinates RNA surveillance, including the mechanism that forms heterochromatin at meiotic genes."	0

How BAX monomers assemble into a higher-order conformation, and the structural determinants essential to membrane permeabilization, remain a mechanistic mystery. A key hurdle has been the inability to generate a homogeneous BAX oligomer (BAX<sub>O</sub>) for analysis. Here, we report the production and characterization of a full-length BAX<sub>O</sub> that recapitulates physiologic BAX activation. Multidisciplinary studies revealed striking conformational consequences of oligomerization and insight into the macromolecular structure of oligomeric BAX. Importantly, BAX<sub>O</sub> enabled the assignment of specific roles to particular residues and α helices that mediate individual steps of the BAX activation pathway, including unexpected functionalities of BAX α6 and α9 in driving membrane disruption. Our results provide the first glimpse of a full-length and functional BAX<sub>O</sub>, revealing structural requirements for the elusive execution phase of mitochondrial apoptosis."	0
"31492635"	"PTEN Suppresses Glycolysis by Dephosphorylating and Inhibiting Autophosphorylated PGK1.The PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently mutated or deleted in cancer and regulates glucose metabolism through the PI3K-AKT pathway. However, whether PTEN directly regulates glycolysis in tumor cells is unclear. We demonstrate here that PTEN directly interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1). PGK1 functions not only as a glycolytic enzyme but also as a protein kinase intermolecularly autophosphorylating itself at Y324 for activation. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN dephosphorylates and inhibits autophosphorylated PGK1, thereby inhibiting glycolysis, ATP production, and brain tumor cell proliferation. In addition, knockin expression of a PGK1 Y324F mutant inhibits brain tumor formation. Analyses of human glioblastoma specimens reveals that PGK1 Y324 phosphorylation levels inversely correlate with PTEN expression status and are positively associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. This work highlights the instrumental role of PGK1 autophosphorylation in its activation and PTEN protein phosphatase activity in governing glycolysis and tumorigenesis."	1
"32130890"	"Regulated Proteolysis of MutSγ Controls Meiotic Crossing Over.Crossover recombination is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. The MutSγ complex, Msh4-Msh5, facilitates crossing over by binding and stabilizing nascent recombination intermediates. We show that these activities are governed by regulated proteolysis. MutSγ is initially inactive for crossing over due to an N-terminal degron on Msh4 that renders it unstable by directly targeting proteasomal degradation. Activation of MutSγ requires the Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 (DDK), which directly phosphorylates and thereby neutralizes the Msh4 degron. Genetic requirements for Msh4 phosphorylation indicate that DDK targets MutSγ only after it has bound to nascent joint molecules (JMs) in the context of synapsing chromosomes. Overexpression studies confirm that the steady-state level of Msh4, not phosphorylation per se, is the critical determinant for crossing over. At the DNA level, Msh4 phosphorylation enables the formation and crossover-biased resolution of double-Holliday Junction intermediates. Our study establishes regulated protein degradation as a fundamental mechanism underlying meiotic crossing over."	1

These Fds are thought to redirect the energy harvested from light to phage-encoded oxidoreductases that enhance viral fitness, but it is unclear how the biophysical properties and partner specificities of phage Fds relate to those of photosynthetic organisms. Here, results of a bioinformatics analysis using a sequence similarity network revealed that phage Fds are most closely related to cyanobacterial Fds that transfer electrons from photosystems to oxidoreductases involved in nutrient assimilation. Structural analysis of myovirus P-SSM2 Fd (pssm2-Fd), which infects the cyanobacterium <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i>, revealed high levels of similarity to cyanobacterial Fds (root mean square deviations of ≤0.5 Å). Additionally, pssm2-Fd exhibited a low midpoint reduction potential (-336 mV <i>versus</i> a standard hydrogen electrode), similar to other photosynthetic Fds, although it had lower thermostability (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i> = 28 °C) than did many other Fds. When expressed in an <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain deficient in sulfite assimilation, pssm2-Fd complemented bacterial growth when coexpressed with a <i>P. marinus</i> sulfite reductase, revealing that pssm2-Fd can transfer electrons to a host protein involved in nutrient assimilation. The high levels of structural similarity with cyanobacterial Fds and reactivity with a host sulfite reductase suggest that phage Fds evolved to transfer electrons to cyanobacterially encoded oxidoreductases."	0
"32234482"	"Cortical Neural Stem Cell Lineage Progression Is Regulated by Extrinsic Signaling Molecule Sonic Hedgehog.Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the prenatal neocortex progressively generate different subtypes of glutamatergic projection neurons. Following that, NSCs have a major switch in their progenitor properties and produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) interneurons for the olfactory bulb (OB), cortical oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Herein, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2<sup>+</sup>) intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2<sup>+</sup> IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population. We demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog signaling is both necessary and sufficient for the generation of GSX2<sup>+</sup> IPCs by reducing GLI3R protein levels. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify the transcriptional profile of GSX2<sup>+</sup> IPCs and the process of the lineage switch of cortical NSCs."	0
"32075764"	"Nef-Mediated CD3-TCR Downmodulation Dampens Acute Inflammation and Promotes SIV Immune Evasion.The inability of Nef to downmodulate the CD3-T cell receptor (TCR) complex distinguishes HIV-1 from other primate lentiviruses and may contribute to its high virulence. However, the role of this Nef function in virus-mediated immune activation and pathogenicity remains speculative. Here, we selectively disrupted this Nef activity in SIV<sub>mac239</sub> and analyzed the consequences for the virological, immunological, and clinical outcome of infection in rhesus macaques. The inability to downmodulate CD3-TCR does not impair viral replication during acute infection but is associated with increased immune activation and antiviral gene expression. Subsequent early reversion in three of six animals suggests strong selective pressure for this Nef function and is associated with high viral loads and progression to simian AIDS. In the absence of reversions, however, viral replication and the clinical course of infection are attenuated. Thus, Nef-mediated downmodulation of CD3 dampens the inflammatory response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and seems critical for efficient viral immune evasion."	0

Characterization of these TCRs has extended our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the recognition of peptide-HLA. However, few examples exist for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

"30503772"	"Small and Large Ribosomal Subunit Deficiencies Lead to Distinct Gene Expression Signatures that Reflect Cellular Growth Rate.Levels of the ribosome, the conserved molecular machine that mediates translation, are tightly linked to cellular growth rate. In humans, ribosomopathies are diseases associated with cell-type-specific pathologies and reduced ribosomal protein (RP) levels. Because gene expression defects resulting from ribosome deficiency have not yet been experimentally defined, we systematically probed mRNA, translation, and protein signatures that were either unlinked from or linked to cellular growth rate in RP-deficient yeast cells. Ribosome deficiency was associated with altered translation of gene subclasses, and profound general secondary effects of RP loss on the spectrum of cellular mRNAs were seen. Among these effects, growth-defective 60S mutants increased synthesis of proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas 40S mutants accumulated mature 60S subunits and increased translation of ribosome biogenesis genes. These distinct signatures of protein synthesis suggest intriguing and currently mysterious differences in the cellular consequences of deficiency for small and large ribosomal subunits."	0
"32101731"	"Non-canonical Caspase-1 Signaling Drives RIP2-Dependent and TNF-α-Mediated Inflammation In Vivo.Pro-inflammatory caspase-1 is a key player in innate immunity. Caspase-1 processes interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 to their mature forms and triggers pyroptosis. These caspase-1 functions are linked to its enzymatic activity. However, loss-of-function missense mutations in CASP1 do not prevent autoinflammation in patients, despite decreased IL-1β production. In vitro data suggest that enzymatically inactive caspase-1 drives inflammation via enhanced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation, independent of IL-1β processing. Here, we report two mouse models of enzymatically inactive caspase-1-C284A, demonstrating the relevance of this pathway in vivo. In contrast to Casp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, caspase-1-C284A mice show pronounced hypothermia and increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6 when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Caspase-1-C284A signaling is RIP2 dependent and mediated by TNF-α but independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LPS-stimulated whole blood from patients carrying loss-of-function missense mutations in CASP1 secretes higher amounts of TNF-α. Taken together, these results reveal non-canonical caspase-1 signaling in vivo."	0
"32203417"	"Phase separation of TAZ compartmentalizes the transcription machinery to promote gene expression.TAZ promotes growth, development and tumorigenesis by regulating the expression of target genes. However, the manner in which TAZ orchestrates the transcriptional responses is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that TAZ forms nuclear condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation to compartmentalize its DNA-binding cofactor TEAD4, coactivators BRD4 and MED1, and the transcription elongation factor CDK9 for transcription. TAZ forms phase-separated droplets in vitro and liquid-like nuclear condensates in vivo, and this ability is negatively regulated by Hippo signalling through LATS-mediated phosphorylation and is mediated by the coiled-coil (CC) domain. Deletion of the TAZ CC domain or substitution with the YAP CC domain prevents the phase separation of TAZ and its ability to induce the expression of TAZ-specific target genes. Thus, we identify a mechanism of transcriptional activation by TAZ and demonstrate that pathway-specific transcription factors also engage the phase-separation mechanism for efficient and specific transcriptional activation."	0
"32905768"	"The Negative Cross-Talk between SAG/RBX2/ROC2 and APC/C E3 Ligases in Regulation of Cell Cycle Progression and Drug Resistance.Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a well-characterized E3 ligase that couples with UBE2C and UBE2S E2s for substrate ubiquitylation by the K11 linkage. Our recent data show that SAG/RBX2/ROC2, a RING component of Cullin-RING E3 ligase, also complexes with these E2s for K11-linked substrate polyubiquitylation. Whether these two E3s cross-talk with each other was previously unknown. Here, we report that SAG competes with APC2 for UBE2C/UBE2S binding to act as a potential endogenous inhibitor of APC/C, thereby regulating the G2-to-M progression. As such, SAG knockdown triggers premature activation of APC/C, leading to mitotic slippage and resistance to anti-microtubule drugs. On the other hand, SAG itself is a substrate of APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup> for targeted degradation at the G1 phase. The degradation-resistant mutant of SAG-R98A/L101A accelerates the G1-to-S progression. Our study reveals that the negative cross-talk between SAG and APC/C is likely a mechanism to ensure the fidelity of cell cycle progression."	1
"32641492"	"Hepatitis C virus NS3-4A protease regulates the lipid environment for RNA replication by cleaving host enzyme 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase.Many RNA viruses create specialized membranes for genome replication by manipulating host lipid metabolism and trafficking, but in most cases, we do not know the molecular mechanisms responsible or how specific lipids may impact the associated membrane and viral process. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a specific, large-fold increase in the steady-state abundance of intracellular desmosterol, an immediate precursor of cholesterol, resulting in increased fluidity of the membrane where HCV RNA replication occurs. Here, we establish the mechanism responsible for HCV's effect on intracellular desmosterol, whereby the HCV NS3-4A protease controls activity of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Our cumulative evidence for the proposed mechanism includes immunofluorescence microscopy experiments showing co-occurrence of DHCR24 and HCV NS3-4A protease; formation of an additional, faster-migrating DHCR24 species (DHCR24*) in cells harboring a HCV subgenomic replicon RNA or ectopically expressing NS3-4A; and biochemical evidence that NS3-4A cleaves DHCR24 to produce DHCR24* <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> We further demonstrate that NS3-4A cleaves DHCR24 between residues Cys<sup>91</sup> and Thr<sup>92</sup> and show that this reduces the intracellular conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Together, these studies demonstrate that NS3-4A directly cleaves DHCR24 and that this results in the enrichment of desmosterol in the membranes where NS3-4A and DHCR24 co-occur. Overall, this suggests a model in which HCV directly regulates the lipid environment for RNA replication through direct effects on the host lipid metabolism."	0

Additional factors potentiate β-catenin activation to promote CRC. Western diets are enriched in linoleic acid (LA); LA-enriched diets promote chemically induced CRC in rodents. 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), the main LA-metabolizing enzyme, is transcriptionally silenced during CRC. Whether LA and 15-LOX-1 affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling is unclear. We report that high dietary LA promotes CRC in mice treated with azoxymethane or with an intestinally targeted Apc mutation (Apc<sup>Δ580</sup>) by upregulating Wnt receptor LRP5 protein expression and β-catenin activation. 15-LOX-1 transgenic expression in mouse intestinal epithelial cells suppresses LRP5 protein expression, β-catenin activation, and CRC. 15-LOX-1 peroxidation of LA in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphates (PI3P_LA) leads to PI3P_13-HODE formation, which decreases PI3P binding to SNX17 and LRP5 and inhibits LRP5 recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane, thereby increasing LRP5 lysosomal degradation. This regulatory mechanism of LRP5/Wnt/β-catenin signaling could be therapeutically targeted to suppress CRC."	0
"30472190"	"Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft.Transcription initiation requires opening of promoter DNA in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC), but it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast PIC that contains underwound, distorted promoter DNA in the closed Pol II cleft. The DNA duplex axis is offset at the upstream edge of the initially melted DNA region (IMR) where DNA opening begins. Unstable IMRs are found in a subset of yeast promoters that we show can still initiate transcription after depletion of the transcription factor (TF) IIH (TFIIH) translocase Ssl2 (XPB in human) from the nucleus in vivo. PIC-induced DNA distortions may thus prime the IMR for melting and may explain how unstable IMRs that are predicted in promoters of Pol I and Pol III can open spontaneously. These results suggest that DNA distortion in the polymerase cleft is a general mechanism that contributes to promoter opening."	0

These tools employ a single effector enzyme of type II or V CRISPR to generate RNA-guided, precise genome breaks. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using type I CRISPR-Cas to effectively introduce a spectrum of long-range chromosomal deletions with a single RNA guide in human embryonic stem cells and HAP1 cells. Type I CRISPR systems rely on the multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex Cascade to identify DNA targets and on the helicase-nuclease enzyme Cas3 to degrade DNA processively. With RNP delivery of T. fusca Cascade and Cas3, we obtained 13%-60% editing efficiency. Long-range PCR-based and high-throughput-sequencing-based lesion analyses reveal that a variety of deletions, ranging from a few hundred base pairs to 100 kilobases, are created upstream of the target site. These results highlight the potential utility of type I CRISPR-Cas for long-range genome manipulations and deletion screens in eukaryotes."	0

The mitochondrial AAA+ protease AFG3L2 is of particular interest, as genetic mutations localized throughout AFG3L2 are linked to diverse neurodegenerative disorders. However, a lack of structural data has limited our understanding of how mutations impact enzymatic function. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a substrate-bound structure of the catalytic core of human AFG3L2. This structure identifies multiple specialized structural features that integrate with conserved motifs required for ATP-dependent translocation to unfold and degrade targeted proteins. Many disease-relevant mutations localize to these unique structural features of AFG3L2 and distinctly influence its activity and stability. Our results provide a molecular basis for neurological phenotypes associated with different AFG3L2 mutations and establish a structural framework to understand how different members of the AAA+ superfamily achieve specialized biological functions."	0

However, how maternally supplied transcripts are dynamically regulated during MZT remains largely unknown. Herein, through genome-wide profiling of RNA 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) modification in zebrafish early embryos, we found that m<sup>5</sup>C-modified maternal mRNAs display higher stability than non-m<sup>5</sup>C-modified mRNAs during MZT.

"32187544"	"Chromatin-Binding Protein PHF6 Regulates Activity-Dependent Transcriptional Networks to Promote Hunger Response.Understanding the mechanisms of activity-dependent gene transcription underlying adaptive behaviors is challenging at neuronal-subtype resolution. Using cell-type specific molecular analysis in agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, we reveal that the profound hunger-induced transcriptional changes greatly depend on plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6), a transcriptional repressor enriched in AgRP neurons. Loss of PHF6 in the satiated mice results in a hunger-state-shifting transcriptional profile, while hunger fails to further induce a rapid and robust activity-dependent gene transcription in PHF6-deficient AgRP neurons. We reveal that PHF6 binds to the promoters of a subset of immediate-early genes (IEGs) and that this chromatin binding is dynamically regulated by hunger state. Depletion of PHF6 decreases hunger-driven feeding motivation and makes the mice resistant to body weight gain under repetitive fasting-refeeding conditions. Our work identifies a neuronal subtype-specific transcriptional repressor that modulates transcriptional profiles in different nutritional states and enables adaptive eating behavior."	0

Using Rxra conditional knockout (cKO) mice and virus-mediated transient gene expression, we show that endogenous Rxra plays important roles in regulating spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical pyramidal neurons. We further show that the effects of RXRA are mediated through its DNA-binding domain in a cell-autonomous and reversible manner. Moreover, unesterified DHA increases spine formation and excitatory synaptic transmission in vivo in an Rxra-dependent fashion. Rxra cKO mice generally behave normally but show deficits in behavior tasks associated with social memory.

"32049019"	"Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation Regulates the Fate Decision between Pathogenic Th17 and Regulatory T Cells.Understanding metabolic pathways that regulate Th17 development is important to broaden therapeutic options for Th17-mediated autoimmunity. Here, we report a pivotal role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for lineage specification toward pathogenic Th17 differentiation. Th17 cells rapidly increase mitochondrial respiration during development, and this is necessary for metabolic reprogramming following T cell activation. Surprisingly, specific inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase ablates Th17 pathogenicity in a mouse model of autoimmunity by preventing Th17 pathogenic signature gene expression. Notably, cells activated under OXPHOS-inhibited Th17 conditions preferentially express Foxp3, rather than Th17 genes, and become suppressive Treg cells. Mechanistically, OXPHOS promotes the Th17 pioneer transcription factor, BATF, and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) and mTOR signaling. Correspondingly, overexpression of BATF rescues Th17 development when ATP synthase activity is restricted. Together, our data reveal a regulatory role of mitochondrial OXPHOS in dictating the fate decision between Th17 and Treg cells by supporting early molecular events necessary for Th17 commitment."	0

How these cells interact and contribute to lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. Using <sup>G12D</sup>KRAS- and <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF-driven mouse lung models, we identify the pleiotropic glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a regulator of TAM-TAF interactions. STC1 is secreted by TAFs and suppresses TAM differentiation, at least in part, by sequestering the binding of GRP94, an autocrine macrophage-differentiation-inducing factor, to its cognate scavenger receptors. The accumulation of mature TAMs in the Stc1-deficient lung leads to enhanced secretion of TGF-β1 and, thus, TAF accumulation in the TME. Consistent with the mouse data, in human lung adenocarcinoma, STC1 expression is restricted to myofibroblasts, and a significant increase of naive macrophages is detected in STC1-high compared with STC1-low cases. This work increases our understanding of lung adenocarcinoma development and suggests new approaches for therapeutic targeting of the TME."	1

The assays are versatile to characterize various aspects of GSCs, such as invasion, integration, and interaction with mature neurons of brain organoids. Tissue clearing and quantitative 3D imaging of GSCs in host organoids reveal that invasiveness is inversely correlated with the organoids' age. Importantly, the described invasion assays can distinguish the invasive behaviors of primary and recurrent GSCs. The assays are also amenable to test pharmacological agents.

However, how cellular proteins facilitate L1 retrotransposition requires elucidation. Here, we demonstrate that single-strand DNA breaks induced by the L1 endonuclease trigger the recruitment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP2) to L1 integration sites and that PARP2 activation leads to the subsequent recruitment of the replication protein A (RPA) complex to facilitate retrotransposition. We further demonstrate that RPA directly binds activated PARP2 through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and can protect single-strand L1 integration intermediates from APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination in vitro. Paradoxically, we provide evidence that RPA can guide APOBEC3A, and perhaps other APOBEC3 proteins, to sites of L1 integration. Thus, the interplay of L1-encoded and evolutionarily conserved cellular proteins is required for efficient retrotransposition; however, these interactions also may be exploited to restrict L1 retrotransposition in the human genome."	0
"32320669"	"Beta-Catenin Causes Adrenal Hyperplasia by Blocking Zonal Transdifferentiation.Activating mutations in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway are key drivers of hyperplasia, the gateway for tumor development. In a wide range of tissues, this occurs primarily through enhanced effects on cellular proliferation. Whether additional mechanisms contribute to β-catenin-driven hyperplasia remains unknown. The adrenal cortex is an ideal system in which to explore this question, as it undergoes hyperplasia following somatic β-catenin gain-of-function (βcat-GOF) mutations. Targeting βcat-GOF to zona Glomerulosa (zG) cells leads to a progressive hyperplastic expansion in the absence of increased proliferation. Instead, we find that hyperplasia results from a functional block in the ability of zG cells to transdifferentiate into zona Fasciculata (zF) cells. Mechanistically, zG cells demonstrate an upregulation of Pde2a, an inhibitor of zF-specific cAMP/PKA signaling. Hyperplasia is further exacerbated by trophic factor stimulation leading to organomegaly. Together, these data indicate that β-catenin drives adrenal hyperplasia through both proliferation-dependent and -independent mechanisms."	0

Such mitogenic inputs are transmitted through multiple signaling pathways that synergize to precisely regulate cell cycle entry and progression. Although the architecture of these signaling networks has been characterized in molecular detail, their relative contribution, especially at later cell cycle stages, remains largely unexplored. By combining quantitative time-resolved measurements of fluorescent reporters in untransformed human cells with targeted pharmacological inhibitors and statistical analysis, we quantify epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced signal processing in individual cells over time and dissect the dynamic contribution of downstream pathways. We define signaling features that encode information about extracellular ligand concentrations and critical time windows for inducing cell cycle transitions. We show that both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity are necessary for initial cell cycle entry, whereas only PI3K affects the duration of S phase at later stages of mitogenic signaling."	0

Here, we control the timing and degree of rod photoreceptor ablation in mature mouse retina and uncover compensation. Following loss of half of the rods, rod bipolar cells mitigate the loss by preserving voltage output. Such mitigation allows partial recovery of ganglion cell responses. We conclude that rod death is compensated for in the circuit because ganglion cell responses to stimulation of half of the rods in an unperturbed circuit are weaker than responses after death of half of the rods. The dominant mechanism of such compensation includes homeostatic regulation of inhibition to balance the loss of excitation."	0
"32084337"	"A Quantitative Genetic Interaction Map of HIV Infection.We have developed a platform for quantitative genetic interaction mapping using viral infectivity as a functional readout and constructed a viral host-dependency epistasis map (vE-MAP) of 356 human genes linked to HIV function, comprising >63,000 pairwise genetic perturbations. The vE-MAP provides an expansive view of the genetic dependencies underlying HIV infection and can be used to identify drug targets and study viral mutations. We found that the RNA deadenylase complex, CNOT, is a central player in the vE-MAP and show that knockout of CNOT1, 10, and 11 suppressed HIV infection in primary T cells by upregulating innate immunity pathways. This phenotype was rescued by deletion of IRF7, a transcription factor regulating interferon-stimulated genes, revealing a previously unrecognized host signaling pathway involved in HIV infection. The vE-MAP represents a generic platform that can be used to study the global effects of how different pathogens hijack and rewire the host during infection."	0
"31914384"	"Distinct Pathogenic Genes Causing Intellectual Disability and Autism Exhibit a Common Neuronal Network Hyperactivity Phenotype.Pathogenic mutations in either one of the epigenetic modifiers EHMT1, MBD5, MLL3, or SMARCB1 have been identified to be causative for Kleefstra syndrome spectrum (KSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical features of both intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To understand how these variants lead to the phenotypic convergence in KSS, we employ a loss-of-function approach to assess neuronal network development at the molecular, single-cell, and network activity level. KSS-gene-deficient neuronal networks all develop into hyperactive networks with altered network organization and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Interestingly, even though transcriptional data reveal distinct regulatory mechanisms, KSS target genes share similar functions in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function, several of which are associated with ID and ASD. Our results show that KSS genes mainly converge at the level of neuronal network communication, providing insights into the pathophysiology of KSS and phenotypically congruent disorders."	0
"31926851"	"PD-1 Imposes Qualitative Control of Cellular Transcriptomes in Response to T Cell Activation.Targeted blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), an immune-checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell activation, provides clinical benefits in various cancers. However, how PD-1 modulates gene expression in T cells remains enigmatic. Here we investigated how PD-1 affects transcriptome changes induced by T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Intriguingly, we identified a huge variance in PD-1 sensitivity among TCR-inducible genes. When we quantified the half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) as the relationship between change in gene expression and TCR signal strength, we found that genes associated with survival and proliferation were efficiently expressed upon TCR activation and resistant to PD-1-mediated inhibition. Conversely, genes encoding cytokines and effector molecules were expressed less efficiently and sensitive to PD-1-mediated inhibition. We further demonstrated that transcription factor binding motifs and CpG frequency in the promoter region affect EC<sub>50</sub> and thus the PD-1 sensitivity of genes. Our findings explain how PD-1, dependent on the TCR signal strength, calibrates cellular transcriptomes to shape functional properties of T cell populations."	0
"31805521"	"Set1/COMPASS repels heterochromatin invasion at euchromatic sites by disrupting Suv39/Clr4 activity and nucleosome stability.Protection of euchromatin from invasion by gene-repressive heterochromatin is critical for cellular health and viability. In addition to constitutive loci such as pericentromeres and subtelomeres, heterochromatin can be found interspersed in gene-rich euchromatin, where it regulates gene expression pertinent to cell fate. While heterochromatin and euchromatin are globally poised for mutual antagonism, the mechanisms underlying precise spatial encoding of heterochromatin containment within euchromatic sites remain opaque. We investigated ectopic heterochromatin invasion by manipulating the fission yeast mating type locus boundary using a single-cell spreading reporter system. We found that heterochromatin repulsion is locally encoded by Set1/COMPASS on certain actively transcribed genes and that this protective role is most prominent at heterochromatin islands, small domains interspersed in euchromatin that regulate cell fate specifiers. Sensitivity to invasion by heterochromatin, surprisingly, is not dependent on Set1 altering overall gene expression levels. Rather, the gene-protective effect is strictly dependent on Set1's catalytic activity. H3K4 methylation, the Set1 product, antagonizes spreading in two ways: directly inhibiting catalysis by Suv39/Clr4 and locally disrupting nucleosome stability. Taken together, these results describe a mechanism for spatial encoding of euchromatic signals that repel heterochromatin invasion."	0
"32877684"	"Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cooperate to Suppress DNA- and RNA-Associated Molecular Pattern Recognition and Anti-Tumor Immune Responses.The DNA-dependent pattern recognition receptor, cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), mediates communication between the DNA damage and the immune responses. Mitotic chromosome missegregation stimulates cGAS activity; however, it is unclear whether progression through mitosis is required for cancercell-intrinsic activation of anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, it is unknown whether cell cycle checkpoint disruption can restore responses in cancer cells that are recalcitrant to DNAdamage-induced inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that prolonged cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>-mitosis boundary from either excessive DNA damage or CDK1 inhibition prevents inflammatory-stimulated gene expression and immune-mediated destruction of distal tumors. Remarkably, DNAdamage-induced inflammatory signaling is restored in a RIG-I-dependent manner upon concomitant disruption of p53 and the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint. These findings link aberrant cell progression and p53 loss to an expanded spectrum of damage-associated molecular pattern recognition and have implications for the design of rational approaches to augment anti-tumor immune responses."	0
"32610120"	"Widespread Inhibition, Antagonism, and Synergy in Mouse Olfactory Sensory Neurons In Vivo.Sensory information is selectively or non-selectively enhanced and inhibited in the brain, but it remains unclear whether and how this occurs at the most peripheral level. Using in vivo calcium imaging of mouse olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium in wild-type and mutant animals, we show that odors produce not only excitatory but also inhibitory responses in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Heterologous assays indicate that odorants can act as agonists to some but inverse agonists to other odorant receptors. We also demonstrate that responses to odor mixtures are extensively suppressed or enhanced in OSNs. When high concentrations of odors are mixed, widespread antagonism suppresses the overall response amplitudes and density. In contrast, a mixture of low concentrations of odors often produces synergistic effects and boosts the faint odor inputs. Thus, odor responses are extensively tuned by inhibition, antagonism, and synergy at the most peripheral level, contributing to robust sensory representations."	0

Here, we observe a positive correlation between the percentages of CD32<sup>+</sup> cells among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of aviremic cART-treated, HIV-infected individuals and their HIV DNA loads in peripheral blood. Moreover, optimization of the CD32<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell purification protocol reveals prominent enrichment for HIV DNA (mean, 292-fold) in these cells.

"31995759"	"PRMT1 Is Recruited via DNA-PK to Chromatin Where It Sustains the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype in Response to Cisplatin.Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is overexpressed in various human cancers and linked to poor response to chemotherapy. Various PRMT1 inhibitors are currently under development; yet, we do not fully understand the mechanisms underpinning PRMT1 involvement in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified PRMT1 as regulator of arginine methylation in ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin. We showed that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) binds to and phosphorylates PRMT1 in response to cisplatin, inducing its chromatin recruitment and redirecting its enzymatic activity toward Arg3 of histone H4 (H4R3). On chromatin, the DNA-PK/PRMT1 axis induces senescence-associated secretory phenotype through H4R3me2a deposition at pro-inflammatory gene promoters. Finally, PRMT1 inhibition reduces the clonogenic growth of cancer cells exposed to low doses of cisplatin, sensitizing them to apoptosis. While unravelling the role of PRMT1 in response to genotoxic agents, our findings indicate the possibility of targeting PRMT1 to overcome chemoresistance in cancer."	1
"32492422"	"Anandamide Metabolites Protect against Seizures through the TRP Channel Water Witch in Drosophila melanogaster.Endocannabinoids protect against seizures, but their mechanism of action is still unclear, as they can have effects independent of known cannabinoid receptors. Using Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks canonical cannabinoid receptors, we report that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol protect against seizures in multiple fly seizure models. Surprisingly, inhibition of anandamide catabolism renders flies insensitive to protection by anandamide, indicating that anandamide metabolites are responsible for seizure protection. Consistent with this finding, arachidonic acid, a direct metabolite of anandamide, protects against seizures. To identify downstream effectors, we test for a role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and find that the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine blocks the protective effect of anandamide. Also, a targeted genetic screen of TRP channels identifies water witch as a mediator of protection by anandamide. Using a Drosophila model, we reveal the role of arachidonic acid in seizure protection and identify a cannabinoid-receptor-1/2-independent mechanism of endocannabinoid seizure protection."	0
"32160554"	"Neuronal BIN1 Regulates Presynaptic Neurotransmitter Release and Memory Consolidation.BIN1, a member of the BAR adaptor protein family, is a significant late-onset Alzheimer disease risk factor. Here, we investigate BIN1 function in the brain using conditional knockout (cKO) models. Loss of neuronal Bin1 expression results in the select impairment of spatial learning and memory. Examination of hippocampal CA1 excitatory synapses reveals a deficit in presynaptic release probability and slower depletion of neurotransmitters during repetitive stimulation, suggesting altered vesicle dynamics in Bin1 cKO mice. Super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy localizes BIN1 to presynaptic sites in excitatory synapses. Bin1 cKO significantly reduces synapse density and alters presynaptic active zone protein cluster formation. Finally, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction analysis uncovers a significant increase in docked and reserve pools of synaptic vesicles at hippocampal synapses in Bin1 cKO mice. Our results demonstrate a non-redundant role for BIN1 in presynaptic regulation, thus providing significant insights into the fundamental function of BIN1 in synaptic physiology relevant to Alzheimer disease."	0
"32665401"	"Tafazzin deficiency impairs CoA-dependent oxidative metabolism in cardiac mitochondria.Barth syndrome is a mitochondrial myopathy resulting from mutations in the tafazzin (<i>TAZ</i>) gene encoding a phospholipid transacylase required for cardiolipin remodeling. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for the function of numerous mitochondrial proteins and processes. However, it is unclear how tafazzin deficiency impacts cardiac mitochondrial metabolism. To address this question while avoiding confounding effects of cardiomyopathy on mitochondrial phenotype, we utilized <i>Taz</i>-shRNA knockdown (<i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> ) mice, which exhibit defective cardiolipin remodeling and respiratory supercomplex instability characteristic of human Barth syndrome but normal cardiac function into adulthood. Consistent with previous reports from other models, mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission and oxidative damage were greater in <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> than in wild-type (WT) hearts, but there were no differences in oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency or membrane potential. Fatty acid and pyruvate oxidation capacities were 40-60% lower in <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> mitochondria, but an up-regulation of glutamate oxidation supported respiration rates approximating those with pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine in WT. Deficiencies in mitochondrial CoA and shifts in the cardiac acyl-CoA profile paralleled changes in fatty acid oxidation enzymes and acyl-CoA thioesterases, suggesting limitations of CoA availability or ""trapping"" in <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> mitochondrial metabolism. Incubation of <i>Taz<sup>KD</sup></i> mitochondria with exogenous CoA partially rescued pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine oxidation capacities, implicating dysregulation of CoA-dependent intermediary metabolism rather than respiratory chain defects in the bioenergetic impacts of tafazzin deficiency. These findings support links among cardiolipin abnormalities, respiratory supercomplex instability, and mitochondrial oxidant production and shed new light on the distinct metabolic consequences of tafazzin deficiency in the mammalian heart."	0
"32610141"	"Molecular Stressors Engender Protein Connectivity Dysfunction through Aberrant N-Glycosylation of a Chaperone.Stresses associated with disease may pathologically remodel the proteome by both increasing interaction strength and altering interaction partners, resulting in proteome-wide connectivity dysfunctions. Chaperones play an important role in these alterations, but how these changes are executed remains largely unknown. Our study unveils a specific N-glycosylation pattern used by a chaperone, Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), to alter its conformational fitness and stabilize a state most permissive for stable interactions with proteins at the plasma membrane. This ""protein assembly mutation' remodels protein networks and properties of the cell. We show in cells, human specimens, and mouse xenografts that proteome connectivity is restorable by inhibition of the N-glycosylated GRP94 variant. In summary, we provide biochemical evidence for stressor-induced chaperone-mediated protein mis-assemblies and demonstrate how these alterations are actionable in disease."	0
"32160514"	"Stepwise Promoter Melting by Bacterial RNA Polymerase.Transcription initiation requires formation of the open promoter complex (RPo). To generate RPo, RNA polymerase (RNAP) unwinds the DNA duplex to form the transcription bubble and loads the DNA into the RNAP active site. RPo formation is a multi-step process with transient intermediates of unknown structure. We use single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to visualize seven intermediates containing Escherichia coli RNAP with the transcription factor TraR en route to forming RPo. The structures span the RPo formation pathway from initial recognition of the duplex promoter in a closed complex to the final RPo. The structures and supporting biochemical data define RNAP and promoter DNA conformational changes that delineate steps on the pathway, including previously undetected transient promoter-RNAP interactions that contribute to populating the intermediates but do not occur in RPo. Our work provides a structural basis for understanding RPo formation and its regulation, a major checkpoint in gene expression throughout evolution."	0

How this epithelium maintains itself remains poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to define the diverse cell populations in the vaginal epithelium. We show that vaginal epithelial cell proliferation is limited to the basal compartment without any obvious label-retaining cells. Furthermore, we developed vaginal organoids and show that the basal cells have increased organoid forming efficiency. Importantly, Axin2 marks a self-renewing subpopulation of basal cells that gives rise to differentiated cells over time. These cells are ovariectomy-resistant stem cells as they proliferate even in the absence of hormones. Upon hormone supplementation, these cells expand and reconstitute the entire vaginal epithelium. Wnt/β-catenin is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of vaginal stem cells.

Here, we provide biochemical, structural, functional, and clinical evidence that Cathepsin S (CTSS) alterations induce a tumor-promoting immune microenvironment in follicular lymphoma (FL). We found CTSS mutations at Y132 in 6% of FL (19/305). Another 13% (37/286) had CTSS amplification, which was associated with higher CTSS expression. CTSS Y132 mutations lead to accelerated autocatalytic conversion from an enzymatically inactive profrom to active CTSS and increased substrate cleavage, including CD74, which regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II)-restricted antigen presentation. Lymphoma cells with hyperactive CTSS more efficiently activated antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro. Tumors with hyperactive CTSS showed increased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine perturbation in a mouse model and in human FLs.

However, history shows that resistance arises regardless of the nature or potency of new drugs. Here, we propose and provide evidence for an alternate strategy to resolve this problem: inhibiting evolution. We determined that the DNA translocase Mfd is an ""evolvability factor"" that promotes mutagenesis and is required for rapid resistance development to all antibiotics tested across highly divergent bacterial species. Importantly, hypermutator alleles that accelerate AMR development did not arise without Mfd, at least during evolution of trimethoprim resistance. We also show that Mfd's role in AMR development depends on its interactions with the RNA polymerase subunit RpoB and the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA. Our findings suggest that AMR development can be inhibited through inactivation of evolvability factors (potentially with ""anti-evolution"" drugs)-in particular, Mfd-providing an unexplored route toward battling the AMR crisis."	0

DNase-seq footprinting enables the prediction of genome-wide binding sites for hundreds of TFs simultaneously. Despite the public availability of high-quality DNase-seq data from hundreds of samples, a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for the locations of genomic footprints is lacking. Here, we develop a scalable footprinting workflow using two state-of-the-art algorithms: Wellington and HINT. We apply our workflow to detect footprints in 192 ENCODE DNase-seq experiments and predict the genomic occupancy of 1,515 human TFs in 27 human tissues. We validate that these footprints overlap true-positive TF binding sites from ChIP-seq. We demonstrate that the locations, depth, and tissue specificity of footprints predict effects of genetic variants on gene expression and capture a substantial proportion of genetic risk for complex traits."	0

The pathogenicity and establishment of <i>S. aureus</i> infections are tightly linked to its ability to modulate host immunity. Persistent infections are often associated with mutant staphylococcal strains that have decreased susceptibility to antibiotics; however, little is known about how these mutations influence bacterial interaction with the host immune system. Here, we discovered that clinical <i>S. aureus</i> isolates activate human monocytes, leading to cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands on the monocytes. We found that expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 (UL16-binding protein 2) is associated with bacterial degradability and phagolysosomal activity. Moreover, <i>S. aureus</i>-induced ULBP2 expression was linked to altered host cell metabolism, including increased cytoplasmic (iso)citrate levels, reduced glycolytic flux, and functional mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that the ability of <i>S. aureus</i> to induce ULBP2 and proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes depends on a functional ClpP protease in <i>S. aureus</i> These findings indicate that <i>S. aureus</i> activates ULBP2 in human monocytes through immunometabolic mechanisms and reveal that <i>clpP</i> inactivation may function as a potential immune evasion mechanism. Our results provide critical insight into the interplay between the host immune system and <i>S. aureus</i> that has evolved under the dual selective pressure of host immune responses and antibiotic treatment.

Secreted cGAMP is then sensed by host cells, eliciting an antitumoral immune response. Due to the antitumoral effects of cGAMP, other CDN-based STING agonists are currently under investigation in clinical trials for metastatic solid tumors. However, it is unknown how cGAMP and other CDNs cross the cell membrane to activate intracellular STING.

Here we provide evidence that α7 nAChRs expressed on interneurons, particularly those in oriens lacunosum moleculare (OLM), also regulate hippocampal theta generation. Local hippocampal infusion of a selective α7 nAChR antagonist significantly reduces hippocampal theta power and impairs Y-maze spontaneous alternation performance in freely moving mice. By knocking out receptors in different neuronal subpopulations, we find that α7 nAChRs expressed in OLM interneurons regulate theta generation. Our in vitro slice studies indicate that α7 nAChR activation increases OLM neuron activity that, in turn, enhances pyramidal cell excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Our study also suggests that mAChR activation promotes transient theta generation, while α7 nAChR activation facilitates future theta generation by similar stimulations, revealing a complex mechanism whereby cholinergic signaling modulates different aspects of hippocampal theta oscillations through different receptor subtypes."	0

"32001512"	"Recurrent SRSF2 mutations in MDS affect both splicing and NMD.Oncogenic mutations in the RNA splicing factors SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 are the most frequent class of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and are also common in clonal hematopoiesis, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a variety of solid tumors. They cause genome-wide splicing alterations that affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and NMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2 mutants enhance the deposition of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated molecular interactions. This architecture then favors the association of key NMD factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of EJC deposition by antisense oligonucleotides circumvents aberrant NMD promoted by mutant SRSF2, restoring the expression of PTC-containing transcript. Our study uncovered critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies, reflecting the regulation at multiple levels of RNA metabolism, from splicing to decay."	0

Using retrograde labeling of mPFC projections to the BLA, we find that BLA-projecting neurons in the infralimbic cortex (IL) are preferentially activated in response to a social cue as compared with BLA-projecting neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL). Chemogenetic interrogation of these sub-circuits shows that activation of PL-BLA or inhibition of IL-BLA circuits impairs social behavior. Sustained closed-loop optogenetic activation of PL-BLA circuitry induces social impairment, corresponding to a negative emotional state as revealed by real-time place preference behavioral avoidance. Reactivation of foot shock-responsive PL-BLA circuitry impairs social behavior.

Here, we examined this binding activity using fluorescence anisotropy with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled ICE-like oligomer (FAM-ICE). In the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Irr addition increased the fluorescence anisotropy, corresponding to formation of the Irr-ICE complex. The addition of EDTA to the Irr-ICE complex reduced fluorescence anisotropy, but fluorescence was recovered after Mn<sup>2+</sup> addition, indicating that Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding is a prerequisite for complex formation. Binding activity toward ICE was lost upon introduction of substitutions in a His-cluster region of Irr, revealing that Mn<sup>2+</sup> binds to this region. We observed that the His-cluster region is also the heme binding site; results from fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses disclosed that the addition of a half-equivalent of heme dissociates Irr from ICE, likely because of Mn<sup>2+</sup> release due to heme binding. We hypothesized that heme binding to another heme binding site, Cys-29, would also inhibit the formation of the Irr-ICE complex because it is proximal to the ICE binding site, which was supported by the loss of ICE binding activity in a Cys-29-mutated Irr. These results indicate that Irr requires Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding to form the Irr-ICE complex and that the addition of heme dissociates Irr from ICE by replacing Mn<sup>2+</sup> with heme or by heme binding to Cys-29."	0

Ductal macrophages are long lived and constantly survey the epithelium through dendrite movement, revealed via advanced intravital imaging. Although initially originating from embryonic precursors, ductal macrophages derive from circulating monocytes as they expand during puberty. Moreover, they undergo proliferation in pregnancy to maintain complete coverage of the epithelium in lactation, when they are poised to phagocytose milk-producing cells post-lactation and facilitate remodelling. Interestingly, ductal macrophages strongly resemble mammary tumour macrophages and form a network that pervades the tumour.

Mechanistic information on VP biogenesis has so far been difficult to attain due to the necessity of studying their formation under conditions of viral replication, where perturbations reducing replication will inevitably impact VP formation. Here, we report a replication-independent expression system, designated pIRO (plasmid-induced replication organelle formation) that induces bona fide DENV and ZIKV VPs that are morphologically indistinguishable from those in infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate that sequences in the 3' terminal RNA region of the DENV, but not the ZIKV genome, contribute to VP formation in a non-replicative manner. These results validate the pIRO system that opens avenues for mechanistically dissecting virus replication from membrane reorganization."	0

Nonstop mutations have been characterized in hereditary diseases, but not in cancer genetics. In a pan-cancer analysis, we curated and analysed 3,412 nonstop mutations from 62 tumour entities, generating a comprehensive database at http://NonStopDB.dkfz.de. Six different nonstop extension mutations affected the tumour suppressor SMAD4, extending its carboxy terminus by 40 amino acids. These caused rapid degradation of the SMAD4 mutants via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A hydrophobic degron signal sequence of ten amino acids within the carboxy-terminal extension was required to induce complete loss of the SMAD4 protein. Thus, we discovered that nonstop mutations can be functionally important in cancer and characterize their loss-of-function impact on the tumour suppressor SMAD4."	0
"31759823"	"A Conserved Noncoding Locus Regulates Random Monoallelic Xist Expression across a Topological Boundary.cis-Regulatory communication is crucial in mammalian development and is thought to be restricted by the spatial partitioning of the genome in topologically associating domains (TADs). Here, we discovered that the Xist locus is regulated by sequences in the neighboring TAD. In particular, the promoter of the noncoding RNA Linx (LinxP) acts as a long-range silencer and influences the choice of X chromosome to be inactivated. This is independent of Linx transcription and independent of any effect on Tsix, the antisense regulator of Xist that shares the same TAD as Linx. Unlike Tsix, LinxP is well conserved across mammals, suggesting an ancestral mechanism for random monoallelic Xist regulation. When introduced in the same TAD as Xist, LinxP switches from a silencer to an enhancer. Our study uncovers an unsuspected regulatory axis for X chromosome inactivation and a class of cis-regulatory effects that may exploit TAD partitioning to modulate developmental decisions."	0

Here, we report that the post-translational SUMO modification is critical for regulating osteoclastogenesis. The expression of the SUMO-specific protease SENP3 is downregulated in osteoclast precursors during osteoclast differentiation. Mice with SENP3 deficiency in bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) exhibit more severe bone loss due to over-activation of osteoclasts after ovariectomy. Deleting SENP3 in BMDMs promotes osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, loss of SENP3 increases interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) SUMO3 modification at the K310 amino acid site, which upregulates expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cell c1 (NFATc1) and osteoclastogenesis. In summary, IRF8 de-SUMO modification mediated by SENP3 suppresses osteoclast differentiation and suggests strategies to treat bone loss diseases."	1
"31995731"	"Protein Turnover in Epithelial Cells and Mucus along the Gastrointestinal Tract Is Coordinated by the Spatial Location and Microbiota.The gastrointestinal tract is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that, together with the mucus layers, protect the underlying tissue from microbial invasion. The epithelium has one of the highest turnover rates in the body. Using stable isotope labeling, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and computational analysis, we report a comprehensive dataset of the turnover of more than 3,000 and the expression of more than 5,000 intestinal epithelial cell proteins, analyzed under conventional and germ-free conditions across five different segments in mouse intestine. The median protein half-life is shorter in the small intestine than in the colon. Differences in protein turnover rates along the intestinal tract can be explained by distinct physiological and immune-related functions between the small and large intestine. An absence of microbiota results in an approximately 1 day longer protein half-life in germ-free animals."	0

Here, we show that mice with an equivalent genetic mutation (16p11.2 duplication mice) exhibit impaired hippocampal-orbitofrontal and hippocampal-amygdala functional connectivity. Expression of schizophrenia-relevant GABAergic cell markers (parvalbumin and calbindin) is selectively decreased in orbitofrontal cortex, while somatostatin expression is decreased in lateral amygdala. When 16p11.2 duplication mice are tested in cognitive tasks dependent on hippocampal-orbitofrontal connectivity, performance is impaired in an 8-arm maze ""N-back"" working memory task and in a touchscreen continuous performance task. Consistent with hippocampal-amygdala dysconnectivity, deficits in ethologically relevant social behaviors are also observed. Overall, the cellular/molecular, brain network, and behavioral alterations markedly mirror those observed in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, the data suggest that 16p11.2 duplications selectively impact hippocampal-amygdaloid-orbitofrontal circuitry, supporting emerging ideas that dysfunction in this network is a core element of schizophrenia and defining a neural circuit endophenotype for the disease."	0

"31398325"	"Landscape of Intercellular Crosstalk in Healthy and NASH Liver Revealed by Single-Cell Secretome Gene Analysis.Cell-cell communication via ligand-receptor signaling is a fundamental feature of complex organs. Despite this, the global landscape of intercellular signaling in mammalian liver has not been elucidated. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on non-parenchymal cells isolated from healthy and NASH mouse livers. Secretome gene analysis revealed a highly connected network of intrahepatic signaling and disruption of vascular signaling in NASH. We uncovered the emergence of NASH-associated macrophages (NAMs), which are marked by high expression of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), as a feature of mouse and human NASH that is linked to disease severity and highly responsive to pharmacological and dietary interventions. Finally, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) serve as a hub of intrahepatic signaling via HSC-derived stellakines and their responsiveness to vasoactive hormones. These results provide unprecedented insights into the landscape of intercellular crosstalk and reprogramming of liver cells in health and disease."	0
"32679076"	"ATP-Driven Separation of Liquid Phase Condensates in Bacteria.Liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) states are key to compartmentalizing components in the absence of membranes; however, it is unclear whether LLPS condensates are actively and specifically organized in the subcellular space and by which mechanisms. Here, we address this question by focusing on the ParABS DNA segregation system, composed of a centromeric-like sequence (parS), a DNA-binding protein (ParB), and a motor (ParA). We show that parS and ParB associate to form nanometer-sized, round condensates. ParB molecules diffuse rapidly within the nucleoid volume but display confined motions when trapped inside ParB condensates. Single ParB molecules are able to rapidly diffuse between different condensates, and nucleation is strongly favored by parS. Notably, the ParA motor is required to prevent the fusion of ParB condensates. These results describe a novel active mechanism that splits, segregates, and localizes non-canonical LLPS condensates in the subcellular space."	0
"32640223"	"GM-CSF Calibrates Macrophage Defense and Wound Healing Programs during Intestinal Infection and Inflammation.Macrophages play a central role in intestinal immunity, but inappropriate macrophage activation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we identify granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a critical regulator of intestinal macrophage activation in patients with IBD and mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. We find that GM-CSF drives the maturation and polarization of inflammatory intestinal macrophages, promoting anti-microbial functions while suppressing wound-healing transcriptional programs. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are a major source of GM-CSF in intestinal inflammation, with a strong positive correlation observed between ILC or CSF2 transcripts and M1 macrophage signatures in IBD mucosal biopsies. Furthermore, GM-CSF-dependent macrophage polarization results in a positive feedback loop that augmented ILC3 activation and type 17 immunity. Together, our data reveal an important role for GM-CSF-mediated ILC-macrophage crosstalk in calibrating intestinal macrophage phenotype to enhance anti-bacterial responses, while inhibiting pro-repair functions associated with fibrosis and stricturing, with important clinical implications."	0
"32719004"	"A revised mechanism for (p)ppGpp synthesis by Rel proteins: The critical role of the 2'-OH of GTP.Bacterial Rel proteins synthesize hyperphosphorylated guanosine nucleotides, denoted as (p)ppGpp, which by inhibiting energy requiring molecular pathways help bacteria to overcome the depletion of nutrients in its surroundings. (p)ppGpp synthesis by Rel involves transferring a pyrophosphate from ATP to the oxygen of 3'-OH of GTP/GDP. Initially, a conserved glutamate at the active site was believed to generate the nucleophile necessary to accomplish the reaction. Later this role was alluded to a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. However, no study has unequivocally established a catalytic mechanism for (p)ppGpp synthesis. Here we present a revised mechanism, wherein for the first time we explore a role for 2'-OH of GTP and show how it is important in generating the nucleophile. Through a careful comparison of substrate-bound structures of Rel, we illustrate that the active site does not discriminate GTP from dGTP, for a substrate. Using biochemical studies, we demonstrate that both GTP and dGTP bind to Rel, but only GTP (but not dGTP) can form the product. Reactions performed using GTP analogs substituted with different chemical moieties at the 2' position suggest a clear role for 2'-OH in catalysis by providing an indispensable hydrogen bond; preliminary computational analysis further supports this view. This study elucidating a catalytic role for 2'-OH of GTP in (p)ppGpp synthesis allows us to propose different mechanistic possibilities by which it generates the nucleophile for the synthesis reaction. This study underscores the selection of ribose nucleotides as second messengers and finds its roots in the old RNA world hypothesis."	0

"32187545"	"Nucleus Accumbens Cell Type- and Input-Specific Suppression of Unproductive Reward Seeking.The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contributes to behavioral inhibition and compulsions, but circuit mechanisms are unclear. Recent evidence suggests that amygdala and thalamic inputs exert opposing control over behavior, much like direct and indirect pathway output neurons. Accordingly, opponent processes between these NAc inputs or cell types may underlie efficient reward seeking. We assess the contributions of these circuit elements to mouse operant behavior during recurring conditions when reward is and is not available. Although direct pathway stimulation is rewarding and indirect pathway stimulation aversive, the activity of both cell types is elevated during periods of behavioral suppression, and the inhibition of either cell-type selectively increases unproductive reward seeking. Amygdala and thalamic inputs are also necessary for behavioral suppression, even though they both support self-stimulation and innervate different NAc subregions. These data suggest that efficient reward seeking relies on complementary activity across NAc cell types and inputs rather than opponent processes between them."	0
"32553161"	"Brain Circuit of Claustrophobia-like Behavior in Mice Identified by Upstream Tracing of Sighing.Emotions are distinct patterns of behavioral and physiological responses triggered by stimuli that induce different brain states. Elucidating the circuits is difficult because of challenges in interrogating emotional brain states and their complex outputs. Here, we leverage the recent discovery in mice of a neural circuit for sighing, a simple, quantifiable output of various emotions. We show that mouse confinement triggers sighing, and this ""claustrophobic"" sighing, but not accompanying tachypnea, requires the same medullary neuromedin B (Nmb)-expressing neurons as physiological sighing. Retrograde tracing from the Nmb neurons identified 12 forebrain centers providing presynaptic input, including hypocretin (Hcrt)-expressing lateral hypothalamic neurons. Confinement activates Hcrt neurons, and optogenetic activation induces sighing and tachypnea whereas pharmacologic inhibition suppresses both responses. The effect on sighing is mediated by HCRT directly on Nmbneurons. We propose that this HCRT-NMB neuropeptide relay circuit mediates claustrophobic sighing and that activated Hcrt neurons are a claustrophobia brain state that directly controls claustrophobic outputs."	0
"32521226"	"The Nuclear SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Quality Control Network Regulates the Dynamics of Cytoplasmic Stress Granules.Exposure of cells to heat or oxidative stress causes misfolding of proteins. To avoid toxic protein aggregation, cells have evolved nuclear and cytosolic protein quality control (PQC) systems. In response to proteotoxic stress, cells also limit protein synthesis by triggering transient storage of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cytosolic stress granules (SGs). We demonstrate that the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (StUbL) pathway, which is part of the nuclear proteostasis network, regulates SG dynamics. We provide evidence that inactivation of SUMO deconjugases under proteotoxic stress initiates SUMO-primed, RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation of RBPs that typically condense into SGs. Impairment of SUMO-primed ubiquitylation drastically delays SG resolution upon stress release. Importantly, the StUbL system regulates compartmentalization of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated FUS mutant in SGs. We propose that the StUbL system functions as surveillance pathway for aggregation-prone RBPs in the nucleus, thereby linking the nuclear and cytosolic axis of proteotoxic stress response."	0
"32755579"	"The Ubiquitin Ligase TRIP12 Limits PARP1 Trapping and Constrains PARP Inhibitor Efficiency.PARP inhibitors (PARPi) cause synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance."	0
"30930056"	"Disruption of Telomerase RNA Maturation Kinetics Precipitates Disease.Mutations in RNA-processing enzymes are increasingly linked to human disease. Telomerase RNA and related noncoding RNAs require 3' end-processing steps, including oligoadenylation. Germline mutations in poly(A)ribonuclease (PARN) cause accumulation of extended human telomerase RNA (hTR) species and precipitate dyskeratosis congenita and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we develop nascent RNAend-seq to measure processing rates of RNA precursors. We find that mature hTR derives from extended precursors but that in PARN-mutant cells hTR maturation kinetically stalls and unprocessed precursors are degraded. Loss of poly(A)polymerase PAPD5 in PARN-mutant cells accelerates hTR maturation and restores hTR processing, indicating that oligoadenylation and deadenylation set rates of hTR maturation. The H/ACA domain mediates hTR maturation by precisely defining the 3' end, recruiting poly(A)polymerase activity, and conferring sensitivity to PARN regulation. These data reveal a feedforward circuit in which post-transcriptional oligoadenylation controls RNA maturation kinetics. Similar alterations in RNA processing rates may contribute to mechanisms of RNA-based human disease."	0

Here, we characterize the TME of six orthotopic, transplantable syngeneic murine HGSOC lines established from genetic models and compare these to patient biopsies. We identify significant correlations between the transcriptome, host cell infiltrates, matrisome, vasculature, and tissue modulus of mouse and human TMEs, with several stromal and malignant targets in common. However, each model shows distinct differences and potential vulnerabilities that enabled us to test predictions about response to chemotherapy and an anti-IL-6 antibody. Using machine learning, the transcriptional profiles of the mouse tumors that differed in chemotherapy response are able to classify chemotherapy-sensitive and -refractory patient tumors. These models provide useful pre-clinical tools and may help identify subgroups of HGSOC patients who are most likely to respond to specific therapies."	0

Here, we show that light promotes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation in the affected genes, whereas in darkness, elongation is lower. These changes in transcription are consistent with elongation causing the observed changes in alternative splicing, as revealed by different drug treatments and genetic evidence. The light control of splicing and elongation is abolished in an Arabidopsis mutant defective in the transcription factor IIS (TFIIS).

Here, we report that mESCs with Wnt3a-bead induction display nonoverlapping preexisting (old) versus newly synthesized (new) histone H3 patterns, but mESCs without Wnt3a beads have largely overlapping patterns. Furthermore, H4K20me2/3, an old histone-enriched modification, displays a higher instance of asymmetric distribution on chromatin fibers from Wnt3a-induced mESCs than those from non-induced mESCs. These locally distinct distributions between old and new histones have both cellular specificity in Wnt3a-induced mESCs and molecular specificity for histones H3 and H4. Given that post-translational modifications at H3 and H4 carry the major histone modifications, our findings provide a mammalian cell culture system to study histone inheritance for maintaining stem cell fate and for resetting it during differentiation."	0
"32341548"	"Pac1/LIS1 stabilizes an uninhibited conformation of dynein to coordinate its localization and activity.Dynein is a microtubule motor that transports many different cargos in various cell types and contexts. How dynein is regulated to perform these activities with spatial and temporal precision remains unclear. Human dynein is regulated by autoinhibition, whereby intermolecular contacts limit motor activity. Whether this mechanism is conserved throughout evolution, whether it can be affected by extrinsic factors, and its role in regulating dynein function remain unclear. Here, we use a combination of negative stain electron microscopy, single-molecule assays, genetic, and cell biological techniques to show that autoinhibition is conserved in budding yeast, and plays a key role in coordinating in vivo dynein function. Moreover, we find that the Lissencephaly-related protein, LIS1 (Pac1 in yeast), plays an important role in regulating dynein autoinhibition. Our studies demonstrate that, rather than inhibiting dynein motility, Pac1/LIS1 promotes dynein activity by stabilizing the uninhibited conformation, which ensures appropriate dynein localization and activity in cells."	0

Epa family members are lectins with binding pockets containing several conserved and variable structural hot spots, which were implicated in mediating functional diversity. In this study, we have performed an elaborate structure-based mutational analysis of numerous Epa paralogs to generally determine the role of diverse structural hot spots in conferring host cell binding and ligand binding specificity. Our study reveals that several conserved structural motifs contribute to efficient host cell binding. Moreover, our directed motif exchange experiments reveal that the variable loop CBL2 is key for programming ligand binding specificity, albeit with limited predictability. In contrast, we find that the variable loop L1 affects host cell binding without significantly influencing the specificity of ligand binding. Our data strongly suggest that variation of numerous structural hot spots in the ligand binding pocket of Epa proteins is a main driver of their functional diversification and evolution."	0
"32665399"	"Glycan analysis of human neutrophil granules implicates a maturation-dependent glycosylation machinery.Protein glycosylation is essential to trafficking and immune functions of human neutrophils. During granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, distinct neutrophil granules are successively formed. Distinct receptors and effector proteins, many of which are glycosylated, are targeted to each type of granule according to their time of expression, a process called ""targeting by timing."" Therefore, these granules are time capsules reflecting different times of maturation that can be used to understand the glycosylation process during granulopoiesis. Herein, neutrophil subcellular granules were fractionated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and <i>N</i>- and <i>O</i>-glycans present in each compartment were analyzed by LC-MS. We found abundant paucimannosidic <i>N</i>-glycans and lack of <i>O</i>-glycans in the early-formed azurophil granules, whereas the later-formed specific and gelatinase granules and secretory vesicles contained complex <i>N-</i> and <i>O-</i>glycans with remarkably elongated <i>N</i>-acetyllactosamine repeats with Lewis epitopes. Immunoblotting and histochemical analysis confirmed the expression of Lewis X and sialyl-Lewis X in the intracellular granules and on the cell surface, respectively. Many glycans identified are unique to neutrophils, and their complexity increased progressively from azurophil granules to specific granules and then to gelatinase granules, suggesting temporal changes in the glycosylation machinery indicative of ""glycosylation by timing"" during granulopoiesis. In summary, this comprehensive neutrophil granule glycome map, the first of its kind, highlights novel granule-specific glycosylation features and is a crucial first step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating protein glycosylation during neutrophil granulopoiesis and a more detailed understanding of neutrophil biology and function."	0

Although developmental transcription factors such as active forms of Notch can directly stimulate transcription by activating enhancers, the effect of their oncogenic subversion on the 3D organization of cancer genomes is largely undetermined. By mapping chromatin looping genome-wide in Notch-dependent triple-negative breast cancer and B cell lymphoma, we show that beyond the well-characterized role of Notch as an activator of distal enhancers, Notch regulates its direct target genes by instructing enhancer repositioning. Moreover, a large fraction of Notch-instructed regulatory loops form highly interacting enhancer and promoter spatial clusters termed ""3D cliques."" Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that Notch preferentially targets hyperconnected 3D cliques that regulate the expression of crucial proto-oncogenes.

High fidelity is ensured because kinetochores can monitor attachment status and tension, using this information to activate checkpoints and error-correction mechanisms. To explore how kinetochores achieve this, we used two- and three-color subpixel fluorescence localization to define how proteins from six major complexes (CCAN, MIS12, NDC80, KNL1, RZZ, and SKA) and the checkpoint proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad2 are organized in the human kinetochore. This reveals how the outer kinetochore has a high nematic order and is largely invariant to the loss of attachment or tension, except for two mechanical sensors. First, Knl1 unravels to relay tension, and second, NDC80 undergoes jackknifing and loss of nematic order under microtubule detachment, with only the latter wired up to the checkpoint signaling system. This provides insight into how kinetochores integrate mechanical signals to promote error-free chromosome segregation."	0

Loss of APE2 is lethal in cells with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, making APE2 a prime target for homologous recombination-defective cancers. However, because the function of APE2 in DNA repair is poorly understood, it is unclear why BRCA-deficient cells require APE2 for viability. Here we present the genetic interaction profiles of APE2, APE1, and TDP1 deficiency coupled to biochemical and structural dissection of APE2. We conclude that the main role of APE2 is to reverse blocked 3' DNA ends, problematic lesions that preclude DNA synthesis. Our work also suggests that TOP1 processing of genomic ribonucleotides is the main source of 3'-blocking lesions relevant to APEX2-BRCA1/2 synthetic lethality.

By constructing α7 chimeras and mutants, we find that NACHO requires the α7 ectodomain to promote receptor assembly and surface trafficking. Also critical are two amino acids in the α7 second transmembrane domain. NACHO-mediated assembly is independent and separable from that induced by cholinergic ligands or RIC-3 protein, the latter of which acts on the large α7 intracellular loop. Proteomics indicates that NACHO associates with the ER oligosaccharyltransferase machinery and with calnexin.

Here, we show that the Foxa protein family members and Hnf4α sequentially and cooperatively bind to chromatin to activate liver-specific gene expression. Although all Foxa proteins bind to and open regions of closed chromatin as pioneer factors, Foxa3 has the unique potential of transferring from the distal to proximal regions of the transcription start site of target genes, binding RNA polymerase II, and co-traversing target genes.

Here we show that the expression and activity of the RBP TDP-43 and the long isoform of the lncRNA Neat1, the scaffold of the nuclear compartment ""paraspeckles,"" are reciprocal in pluripotent and differentiated cells because of their cross-regulation. In pluripotent cells, TDP-43 represses the formation of paraspeckles by enhancing the polyadenylated short isoform of Neat1. TDP-43 also promotes pluripotency by regulating alternative polyadenylation of transcripts encoding pluripotency factors, including Sox2, which partially protects its 3' UTR from miR-21-mediated degradation. Conversely, paraspeckles sequester TDP-43 and other RBPs from mRNAs and promote exit from pluripotency and embryonic patterning in the mouse. We demonstrate that cross-regulation between TDP-43 and Neat1 is essential for their efficient regulation of a broad network of genes and, therefore, of pluripotency and differentiation."	0

"32554805"	"Protein docking and steered molecular dynamics suggest alternative phospholamban-binding sites on the SERCA calcium transporter.The transport activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) in cardiac myocytes is modulated by an inhibitory interaction with a transmembrane peptide, phospholamban (PLB). Previous biochemical studies have revealed that PLB interacts with a specific inhibitory site on SERCA, and low-resolution structural evidence suggests that PLB interacts with distinct alternative sites on SERCA. High-resolution details of the structural determinants of SERCA regulation have been elusive because of the dynamic nature of the regulatory complex. In this study, we used computational approaches to develop a structural model of SERCA-PLB interactions to gain a mechanistic understanding of PLB-mediated SERCA transport regulation. We combined steered molecular dynamics and membrane protein-protein docking experiments to achieve both a global search and all-atom force calculations to determine the relative affinities of PLB for candidate sites on SERCA. We modeled the binding of PLB to several SERCA conformations, representing different enzymatic states sampled during the calcium transport catalytic cycle. The results of the steered molecular dynamics and docking experiments indicated that the canonical PLB-binding site (comprising transmembrane helices M2, M4, and M9) is the preferred site. This preference was even more stringent for a superinhibitory PLB variant. Interestingly, PLB-binding specificity became more ambivalent for other SERCA conformers. These results provide evidence for polymorphic PLB interactions with novel sites on M3 and with the outside of the SERCA helix M9. Our findings are compatible with previous physical measurements that suggest that PLB interacts with multiple binding sites, conferring dynamic responsiveness to changing physiological conditions."	0

"32492430"	"Inferring Active Metabolic Pathways from Proteomics and Essentiality Data.Here, we propose an approach to identify active metabolic pathways by integrating gene essentiality analysis and protein abundance. We use two bacterial species (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma agalactiae) that share a high gene content similarity yet show significant metabolic differences. First, we build detailed metabolic maps of their carbon metabolism, the most striking difference being the absence of two key enzymes for glucose metabolism in M. agalactiae. We then determine carbon sources that allow growth in M. agalactiae, and we introduce glucose-dependent growth to show the functionality of its remaining glycolytic enzymes. By analyzing gene essentiality and performing quantitative proteomics, we can predict the active metabolic pathways connected to carbon metabolism and show significant differences in use and direction of key pathways despite sharing the large majority of genes. Gene essentiality combined with quantitative proteomics and metabolic maps can be used to determine activity and directionality of metabolic pathways."	0
"31474573"	"Polyamines Control eIF5A Hypusination, TFEB Translation, and Autophagy to Reverse B Cell Senescence.Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans."	1
"32075733"	"HIRA, a DiGeorge Syndrome Candidate Gene, Confers Proper Chromatin Accessibility on HSCs and Supports All Stages of Hematopoiesis.HIRA is a histone chaperone that deposits the histone variant H3.3 in transcriptionally active genes. In DiGeorge syndromes, a DNA stretch encompassing HIRA is deleted. The syndromes manifest varied abnormalities, including immunodeficiency and thrombocytopenia. HIRA is essential in mice, as total knockout (KO) results in early embryonic death. However, the role of HIRA in hematopoiesis is poorly understood. We investigate hematopoietic cell-specific Hira deletion in mice and show that it dramatically reduces bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia. In contrast, fetal hematopoiesis is normal in Hira-KO mice, although fetal HSCs lack the reconstitution capacity. Transcriptome analysis reveals that HIRA is required for expression of many transcription factors and signaling molecules critical for HSCs. ATAC-seq analysis demonstrates that HIRA establishes HSC-specific DNA accessibility, including the SPIB/PU.1 sites. Together, HIRA provides a chromatin environment essential for HSCs, thereby steering their development and survival."	0
"32231311"	"Pro-neuronal activity of Myod1 due to promiscuous binding to neuronal genes.The on-target pioneer factors Ascl1 and Myod1 are sequence-related but induce two developmentally unrelated lineages-that is, neuronal and muscle identities, respectively. It is unclear how these two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors mediate such fundamentally different outcomes. The chromatin binding of Ascl1 and Myod1 was surprisingly similar in fibroblasts, yet their transcriptional outputs were drastically different. We found that quantitative binding differences explained differential chromatin remodelling and gene activation. Although strong Ascl1 binding was exclusively associated with bHLH motifs, strong Myod1-binding sites were co-enriched with non-bHLH motifs, possibly explaining why Ascl1 is less context dependent. Finally, we observed that promiscuous binding of Myod1 to neuronal targets results in neuronal reprogramming when the muscle program is inhibited by Myt1l. Our findings suggest that chromatin access of on-target pioneer factors is primarily driven by the protein-DNA interaction, unlike ordinary context-dependent transcription factors, and that promiscuous transcription factor binding requires specific silencing mechanisms to ensure lineage fidelity."	0

"32460022"	"Macrophages Use Distinct Actin Regulators to Switch Engulfment Strategies and Ensure Phagocytic Plasticity In Vivo.Macrophages must not only be responsive to an array of different stimuli, such as infection and cellular damage, but also perform phagocytosis within the diverse and complex tissue environments found in vivo. This requires a high degree of morphological and therefore cytoskeletal plasticity. Here, we use the exceptional genetics and in vivo imaging of Drosophila embryos to study macrophage phagocytic versatility during apoptotic corpse clearance. We find that macrophage phagocytosis is highly robust, arising from their possession of two distinct modes of engulfment that utilize exclusive suites of actin-regulatory proteins. ""Lamellipodial phagocytosis"" is Arp2/3-complex-dependent and allows cells to migrate toward and envelop apoptotic corpses. Alternatively, Diaphanous and Ena drive filopodial phagocytosis to reach out and draw in debris. Macrophages switch to ""filopodial phagocytosis"" to overcome spatial constraint, providing the robust plasticity necessary to ensure that whatever obstacle they encounter in vivo, they fulfil their critical clearance function."	0
"32521225"	"DDI2 Is a Ubiquitin-Directed Endoprotease Responsible for Cleavage of Transcription Factor NRF1.The Ddi1/DDI2 proteins are ubiquitin shuttling factors, implicated in a variety of cellular functions. In addition to ubiquitin-binding and ubiquitin-like domains, they contain a conserved region with similarity to retroviral proteases, but whether and how DDI2 functions as a protease has remained unknown. Here, we show that DDI2 knockout cells are sensitive to proteasome inhibition and accumulate high-molecular weight, ubiquitylated proteins that are poorly degraded by the proteasome. These proteins are targets for the protease activity of purified DDI2. No evidence for DDI2 acting as a de-ubiquitylating enzyme was uncovered, which could suggest that it cleaves the ubiquitylated protein itself. In support of this idea, cleavage of transcription factor NRF1 is known to require DDI2 activity in vivo. We show that DDI2 is indeed capable of cleaving NRF1 in vitro but only when NRF1 protein is highly poly-ubiquitylated. Together, these data suggest that DDI2 is a ubiquitin-directed endoprotease."	0
"30472188"	"OTUB2 Promotes Cancer Metastasis via Hippo-Independent Activation of YAP and TAZ.The transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ play important roles in development, physiology, and tumorigenesis and are negatively controlled by the Hippo pathway. It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ. Our results establish OTUB2 as an essential modulator of YAP/TAZ and also reveal a novel mechanism via which YAP/TAZ activity is induced by oncogenic KRAS."	1
"32640231"	"Neto-α Controls Synapse Organization and Homeostasis at the Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction.Glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins control receptor distribution and function, ultimately controlling synapse assembly, maturation, and plasticity. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse with both pre- and postsynaptic kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), we show that the auxiliary protein Neto evolved functionally distinct isoforms to modulate synapse development and homeostasis. Using genetics, cell biology, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that Neto-α functions on both sides of the NMJ. In muscle, Neto-α limits the size of the postsynaptic receptor field. In motor neurons (MNs), Neto-α controls neurotransmitter release in a KAR-dependent manner. In addition, Neto-α is both required and sufficient for the presynaptic increase in neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic sensitivity. This KAR-independent function of Neto-α is involved in activity-induced cytomatrix remodeling. We propose that Drosophila ensures NMJ functionality by acquiring two Neto isoforms with differential expression patterns and activities."	0

Many details of the mechanism via which this occurs remain to be elucidated. Motivated by the lacuna in the field and by the prospects of developing de novo artificial granules that provide extrinsic control of translation, we report a bottom-up approach to engineer ribonucleoprotein granules composed of a recombinant RNA-binding IDP that exhibits phase behavior in water. We developed a kinetic model to illustrate that these granules inhibit translation through reversible or irreversible sequestration of mRNA. Within monodisperse droplets capable of transcription and translation, we experimentally demonstrate temporal inhibition of translation by using designer IDPs that exhibit tunable phase behavior. This work lays the foundation for developing artificial granules that promise to further our mechanistic understanding of their naturally occurring counterparts."	0
"32049026"	"Loss of IQSEC3 Disrupts GABAergic Synapse Maintenance and Decreases Somatostatin Expression in the Hippocampus.Gephyrin interacts with various GABAergic synaptic proteins to organize GABAergic synapse development. Among the multitude of gephyrin-binding proteins is IQSEC3, a recently identified component at GABAergic synapses that acts through its ADP ribosylation factor-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ARF-GEF) activity to orchestrate GABAergic synapse formation. Here, we show that IQSEC3 knockdown (KD) reduced GABAergic synaptic density in vivo, suggesting that IQSEC3 is required for GABAergic synapse maintenance in vivo. We further show that IQSEC3 KD in the dentate gyrus (DG) increases seizure susceptibility and triggers selective depletion of somatostatin (SST) peptides in the DG hilus in an ARF-GEP activity-dependent manner. Strikingly, selective introduction of SST into SST interneurons in DG-specific IQSEC3-KD mice reverses GABAergic synaptic deficits. Thus, our data suggest that IQSEC3 is required for linking gephyrin-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes with ARF-dependent pathways to prevent aberrant, runaway excitation and thereby contributes to the integrity of SST interneurons and proper GABAergic synapse maintenance."	0
"32437639"	"ATP Hydrolysis by the SNF2 Domain of Dnmt5 Is Coupled to Both Specific Recognition and Modification of Hemimethylated DNA.C.neoformans Dnmt5 is an unusually specific maintenance-type CpG methyltransferase (DNMT) that mediates long-term epigenome evolution. It harbors a DNMT domain and SNF2 ATPase domain. We find that the SNF2 domain couples substrate specificity to an ATPase step essential for DNA methylation. Coupling occurs independent of nucleosomes. Hemimethylated DNA preferentially stimulates ATPase activity, and mutating Dnmt5's ATP-binding pocket disproportionately reduces ATPase stimulation by hemimethylated versus unmethylated substrates. Engineered DNA substrates that stabilize a reaction intermediate by mimicking a ""flipped-out"" conformation of the target cytosine bypass the SNF2 domain's requirement for hemimethylation. This result implies that ATP hydrolysis by the SNF2 domain is coupled to the DNMT domain conformational changes induced by preferred substrates. These findings establish a new role for a SNF2 ATPase: controlling an adjoined enzymatic domain's substrate recognition and catalysis. We speculate that this coupling contributes to the exquisite specificity of Dnmt5 via mechanisms related to kinetic proofreading."	0
"31351877"	"Activation of PARP-1 by snoRNAs Controls Ribosome Biogenesis and Cell Growth via the RNA Helicase DDX21.PARP inhibitors (PARPi) prevent cancer cell growth by inducing synthetic lethality with DNA repair defects (e.g., in BRCA1/2 mutant cells). We have identified an alternative pathway for PARPi-mediated growth control in BRCA1/2-intact breast cancer cells involving rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. PARP-1 binds to snoRNAs, which stimulate PARP-1 catalytic activity in the nucleolus independent of DNA damage. Activated PARP-1 ADP-ribosylates DDX21, an RNA helicase that localizes to nucleoli and promotes rDNA transcription when ADP-ribosylated. Treatment with PARPi or mutation of the ADP-ribosylation sites reduces DDX21 nucleolar localization, rDNA transcription, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, and cell growth. The salient features of this pathway are evident in xenografts in mice and human breast cancer patient samples. Elevated levels of PARP-1 and nucleolar DDX21 are associated with cancer-related outcomes. Our studies provide a mechanistic rationale for efficacy of PARPi in cancer cells lacking defects in DNA repair whose growth is inhibited by PARPi."	0
"32101736"	"High-Accuracy Detection of Neuronal Ensemble Activity in Two-Photon Functional Microscopy Using Smart Line Scanning.Two-photon functional imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) is one prominent tool to map neural activity. Under optimized experimental conditions, GECIs detect single action potentials in individual cells with high accuracy. However, using current approaches, these optimized conditions are never met when imaging large ensembles of neurons. Here, we developed a method that substantially increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of population imaging of GECIs by using galvanometric mirrors and fast smart line scan (SLS) trajectories. We validated our approach in anesthetized and awake mice on deep and dense GCaMP6 staining in the mouse barrel cortex during spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. Compared to raster population imaging, SLS led to increased SNR, higher probability of detecting calcium events, and more precise identification of functional neuronal ensembles. SLS provides a cheap and easily implementable tool for high-accuracy population imaging of neural GCaMP6 signals by using galvanometric-based two-photon microscopes."	0

"30503771"	"Iruka Eliminates Dysfunctional Argonaute by Selective Ubiquitination of Its Empty State.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are loaded into the Argonaute subfamily of proteins (AGO) to form an effector complex that silences target genes. Empty but not miRNA-loaded AGO is selectively degraded across species. However, the mechanism and biological significance of selective AGO degradation remain unclear. We discovered a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase we named Iruka (Iru), which selectively ubiquitinates the empty form of Drosophila Ago1 to trigger its degradation. Iru preferentially binds empty Ago1 and ubiquitinates Lys514 in the L2 linker, which is predicted to be inaccessible in the miRNA-loaded state. Depletion of Iru results in global impairment of miRNA-mediated silencing of target genes and in the accumulation of aberrant Ago1 that is dysfunctional for canonical protein-protein interactions and miRNA loading. Our findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism for the selective degradation of empty AGO that underlies a quality control process to ensure AGO function."	0

"32783930"	"RAI1 Regulates Activity-Dependent Nascent Transcription and Synaptic Scaling.Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as synaptic scaling are critically dependent on transcription. Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs.

We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity."	0

Model predictions are validated against independent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring pairwise distances, and Tri-C data identifying three-way contacts. The architecture is rearranged during the transition from ESCs to erythroid cells, associated with the activation of the globin genes. We find that in ESCs, the spatial organization conforms to a highly intermingled 3D structure involving non-specific contacts, whereas in erythroid cells the α-globin genes and their enhancers form a self-contained domain, arranged in a folded hairpin conformation, separated from intermingling flanking regions by a thermodynamic mechanism of micro-phase separation.

"32546482"	"Viperin: An ancient radical SAM enzyme finds its place in modern cellular metabolism and innate immunity.Viperin plays an important and multifaceted role in the innate immune response to viral infection. Viperin is also notable as one of very few radical SAM-dependent enzymes present in higher animals; however, the enzyme appears broadly conserved across all kingdoms of life, which suggests that it represents an ancient defense mechanism against viral infections. Although viperin was discovered some 20 years ago, only recently was the enzyme's structure determined and its catalytic activity elucidated. The enzyme converts CTP to 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP, which functions as novel chain-terminating antiviral nucleotide when misincorporated by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Moreover, in higher animals, viperin interacts with numerous other host and viral proteins, and it is apparent that this complex network of interactions constitutes another important aspect of the protein's antiviral activity. An emerging theme is that viperin appears to facilitate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of some of the proteins it interacts with. Viperin-targeted protein degradation contributes to the antiviral response either by down-regulating various metabolic pathways important for viral replication or by directly targeting viral proteins for degradation. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the structure and catalytic activity of viperin, together with studies investigating the interactions between viperin and its target proteins. These studies have provided detailed insights into the biochemical processes underpinning this unusual enzyme's wide-ranging antiviral activity. We also highlight recent intriguing reports that implicate a broader role for viperin in regulating nonpathological cellular processes, including thermogenesis and protein secretion."	0

In vivo inactivation of ABCA1 or expression of ABCA1 mutants in hematopoietic cells in the setting of Tet2 loss demonstrates a myelosuppressive function of ABCA1. Mechanistically, ABCA1 mutations impair the tumor-suppressor functions of WT ABCA1 in myeloproliferative neoplasms by increasing the IL-3Rβ signaling via MAPK and JAK2 and subsequent metabolic reprogramming. Overexpression of a human apolipoprotein A-1 transgene dampens myeloproliferation.

By the combined analysis of transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilities and the binding of mRNAs to human Pumilio 1 (PUM1), we identify 48 mRNAs that both bind to PUM1 and exhibit PUM1-dependent degradation. Analysis of changes in the abundance of PUM1 and its degradation target mRNAs in RNA-seq data indicate that DNA-damaging agents negatively regulate PUM1-mediated mRNA decay. Cells exposed to cisplatin have reduced PUM1 abundance and increased PCNA and UBE2A mRNAs encoding proteins involved in DNA damage tolerance by translesion synthesis (TLS). Cells overexpressing PUM1 exhibit impaired DNA synthesis and TLS and increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. Thus, our method identifies target mRNAs of PUM1-mediated decay and reveals that cells respond to DNA damage by inhibiting PUM1-mediated mRNA decay to activate TLS."	1

"32492414"	"Chaperone-Mediated Protein Disaggregation Triggers Proteolytic Clearance of Intra-nuclear Protein Inclusions.The formation of insoluble inclusions in the cytosol and nucleus is associated with impaired protein homeostasis and is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the absence of the autophagic machinery, nuclear protein aggregates require a solubilization step preceding degradation by the 26S proteasome. Using yeast, we identify a nuclear protein quality control pathway required for the clearance of protein aggregates. The nuclear J-domain protein Apj1 supports protein disaggregation together with Hsp70 but independent of the canonical disaggregase Hsp104. Disaggregation mediated by Apj1/Hsp70 promotes turnover rather than refolding. A loss of Apj1 activity uncouples disaggregation from proteasomal turnover, resulting in accumulation of toxic soluble protein species. Endogenous substrates of the Apj1/Hsp70 pathway include both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which aggregate inside the nucleus upon proteotoxic stress. These findings demonstrate the coordinated activity of the Apj1/Hsp70 disaggregation system with the 26S proteasome in facilitating the clearance of toxic inclusions inside the nucleus."	0

Here, we show, using melanoma as a model, that while the IL-33/IL C2/eosinophil axis suppresses tumor growth, tumor-derived lactate attenuates the function and survival of ILC2s. Melanomas with reduced lactate production (LDHA<sup>low</sup>) are growth delayed and typified by an increased number of ILC2s compared with control tumors. Upon IL-33 stimulation, ILC2s accompanied by eosinophils more effectively restrain the growth of LDHA<sup>low</sup> tumors than control melanomas. Furthermore, database analysis reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LDHA and markers associated with ILC2s and the association of high expression of IL33 and an eosinophil marker SIGLEC8 with better overall survival in human cutaneous melanoma patients.

The trimeric fusion glycoprotein (GP) is the sole target for neutralizing antibodies and is the major focus of vaccine development. Soluble GP ectodomains are unstable and mostly monomeric when not fused to a heterologous trimerization domain. Here, we report structure-based designs of Ebola and Marburg GP trimers based on a stabilizing mutation in the hinge loop in refolding region 1 and substitution of a partially buried charge at the interface of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. The combined substitutions (T577P and K588F) substantially increased trimer expression for Ebola GP proteins. We determined the crystal structure of stabilized GP from the Makona Zaire ebolavirus strain without a trimerization domain or complexed ligand. The structure reveals that the stabilized GP adopts the same trimeric prefusion conformation, provides insight into triggering of GP conformational changes, and should inform future filovirus vaccine development."	0
"31999954"	"Autism-Misregulated eIF4G Microexons Control Synaptic Translation and Higher Order Cognitive Functions.Microexons represent the most highly conserved class of alternative splicing, yet their functions are poorly understood. Here, we focus on closely related neuronal microexons overlapping prion-like domains in the translation initiation factors, eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, the splicing of which is activity dependent and frequently disrupted in autism. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of these microexons selectively upregulates synaptic proteins that control neuronal activity and plasticity and further triggers a gene expression program mirroring that of activated neurons. Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning, and memory deficits, accompanied by altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We provide evidence that the eIF4G microexons function as a translational brake by causing ribosome stalling, through their propensity to promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP. The results thus reveal an autism-disrupted mechanism by which alternative splicing specializes neuronal translation to control higher order cognitive functioning."	0
"32111735"	"The tetraspanin Tspan15 is an essential subunit of an ADAM10 scissor complex.A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is a transmembrane protein essential for embryonic development, and its dysregulation underlies disorders such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammation. ADAM10 is a ""molecular scissor"" that proteolytically cleaves the extracellular region from >100 substrates, including Notch, amyloid precursor protein, cadherins, growth factors, and chemokines. ADAM10 has been recently proposed to function as six distinct scissors with different substrates, depending on its association with one of six regulatory tetraspanins, termed TspanC8s. However, it remains unclear to what degree ADAM10 function critically depends on a TspanC8 partner, and a lack of monoclonal antibodies specific for most TspanC8s has hindered investigation of this question. To address this knowledge gap, here we designed an immunogen to generate the first monoclonal antibodies targeting Tspan15, a model TspanC8. The immunogen was created in an ADAM10-knockout mouse cell line stably overexpressing human Tspan15, because we hypothesized that expression in this cell line would expose epitopes that are normally blocked by ADAM10. Following immunization of mice, this immunogen strategy generated four Tspan15 antibodies. Using these antibodies, we show that endogenous Tspan15 and ADAM10 co-localize on the cell surface, that ADAM10 is the principal Tspan15-interacting protein, that endogenous Tspan15 expression requires ADAM10 in cell lines and primary cells, and that a synthetic ADAM10/Tspan15 fusion protein is a functional scissor. Furthermore, two of the four antibodies impaired ADAM10/Tspan15 activity. These findings suggest that Tspan15 directly interacts with ADAM10 in a functional scissor complex."	0
"31522987"	"Distinct Classes of Chromatin Loops Revealed by Deletion of an RNA-Binding Region in CTCF.Mammalian genomes are folded into topologically associating domains (TADs), consisting of chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Some loops are cell-type specific. Here we asked whether CTCF loops are established by a universal or locus-specific mechanism. Investigating the molecular determinants of CTCF clustering, we found that CTCF self-association in vitro is RNase sensitive and that an internal RNA-binding region (RBR<sub>i</sub>) mediates CTCF clustering and RNA interaction in vivo. Strikingly, deleting the RBR<sub>i</sub> impairs about half of all chromatin loops in mESCs and causes deregulation of gene expression. Disrupted loop formation correlates with diminished clustering and chromatin binding of RBR<sub>i</sub> mutant CTCF, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least two classes: RBR<sub>i</sub>-independent and RBR<sub>i</sub>-dependent loops. We speculate that evidence for RBR<sub>i</sub>-dependent loops may provide a molecular mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops, potentially regulated by RNA(s) or other RBR<sub>i</sub>-interacting partners."	0
"32726635"	"Bab2 Functions as an Ecdysone-Responsive Transcriptional Repressor during Drosophila Development.Drosophila development is governed by distinct ecdysone steroid pulses that initiate spatially and temporally defined gene expression programs. The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric-à-brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression. Bab2 directly binds to Sgs loci in vitro and represses all Sgs genes in vivo. Our work characterizes Bab2 as a temporal regulator of somatic gene expression in response to systemic ecdysone signaling."	1
"32783939"	"Cell-Based Strain Remodeling of a Nonfibrous Matrix as an Organizing Principle for Vasculogenesis.Endothelial tube formation on a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) is a well-established in vitro model for studying the processes of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. However, to date, the organizing principles that underlie the morphogenesis of this network and that shape the initial process of cells' finding one another remain elusive. Here, we identify a mechanism that allows cells to form networks by mechanically reorganizing and stiffening their extracellular matrix, independent of chemical guidance cues. Interestingly, we find that this cellular self-organization strongly depends on the connectivity, plasticity, and topology of the surrounding matrix; cell contractility; and cell density. Cells rearrange the matrix and form bridges of matrix material that are stiffer than their surroundings, thus creating a durotactic track for the initiation of cell protrusions and cell-cell contacts. This contractility-based communication via strain stiffening and matrix rearrangement might be a general organizing principle during tissue development or regeneration."	0
"32023467"	"The Amount of BCL6 in B Cells Shortly after Antigen Engagement Determines Their Representation in Subsequent Germinal Centers.It is unknown whether the incremental increases in BCL6 amounts in antigen-activated B cells influence the unfolding differentiation before germinal center (GC) formation. By comparing shortly after immunization the distribution of conventional B cells to those enforced to express BCL6 at the upper quartile of normal and those lacking BCL6 altogether, we determined that B cell representation in the stages before the GC compartment was related to BCL6 amounts. This was not by increased proliferation or suppression of early plasmablast differentiation, but rather by preferential recruitment and progression through these early stages of B cell activation, culminating in preferential transition into GC. Once established, this bias was stable in GC over several weeks; other BCL6-regulated GC B cell behaviors were unaffected. We propose that setting BCL6 amounts very early in activated B cells will be central in determining clonal representation in the GC and thus memory populations."	0
"31006538"	"Intrinsically Disordered Protein TEX264 Mediates ER-phagy.Certain proteins and organelles can be selectively degraded by autophagy. Typical substrates and receptors of selective autophagy have LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) that bind to autophagosomal LC3 and GABARAP family proteins. Here, we performed a differential interactome screen using wild-type LC3B and a LIR recognition-deficient mutant and identified TEX264 as a receptor for autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy). TEX264 is an ER protein with a single transmembrane domain and a LIR motif. TEX264 interacts with LC3 and GABARAP family proteins more efficiently and is expressed more ubiquitously than previously known ER-phagy receptors. ER-phagy is profoundly blocked by deletion of TEX264 alone and almost completely by additional deletion of FAM134B and CCPG1. A long intrinsically disordered region of TEX264 is required for its ER-phagy receptor function to bridge the gap between the ER and autophagosomal membranes independently of its amino acid sequence. These results suggest that TEX264 is a major ER-phagy receptor."	0
"32640233"	"Theta Oscillations Coincide with Sustained Hyperpolarization in CA3 Pyramidal Cells, Underlying Decreased Firing.Brain states modulate the membrane potential dynamics of neurons, influencing the functional repertoire of the network. Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, which preferentially occurs during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and a reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta, as observed in ensemble recordings."	0
"32668248"	"A Patient-Derived Cell Atlas Informs Precision Targeting of Glioblastoma.Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with few therapeutic options. The disease presents with a complex spectrum of genomic aberrations, but the pharmacological consequences of these aberrations are partly unknown. Here, we report an integrated pharmacogenomic analysis of 100 patient-derived GBM cell cultures from the human glioma cell culture (HGCC) cohort. Exploring 1,544 drugs, we find that GBM has two main pharmacological subgroups, marked by differential response to proteasome inhibitors and mutually exclusive aberrations in TP53 and CDKN2A/B. We confirm this trend in cell and in xenotransplantation models, and identify both Bcl-2 family inhibitors and p53 activators as potentiators of proteasome inhibitors in GBM cells. We can further predict the responses of individual cell cultures to several existing drug classes, presenting opportunities for drug repurposing and design of stratified trials. Our functionally profiled biobank provides a valuable resource for the discovery of new treatments for GBM."	0
"31104896"	"Co-transcriptional Loading of RNA Export Factors Shapes the Human Transcriptome.During gene expression, RNA export factors are mainly known for driving nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. While early studies suggested that the exon junction complex (EJC) provides a binding platform for them, subsequent work proposed that they are only recruited by the cap binding complex to the 5' end of RNAs, as part of TREX. Using iCLIP, we show that the export receptor Nxf1 and two TREX subunits, Alyref and Chtop, are recruited to the whole mRNA co-transcriptionally via splicing but before 3' end processing. Consequently, Alyref alters splicing decisions and Chtop regulates alternative polyadenylation. Alyref is recruited to the 5' end of RNAs by CBC, and our data reveal subsequent binding to RNAs near EJCs. We demonstrate that eIF4A3 stimulates Alyref deposition not only on spliced RNAs close to EJC sites but also on single-exon transcripts. Our study reveals mechanistic insights into the co-transcriptional recruitment of mRNA export factors and how this shapes the human transcriptome."	0

Until now, the dogma has been that HIV-1 lacks O-linked carbohydrate on Env. Here we show that a subset of patient-derived HIV-1 isolates contain O-linked carbohydrate on the variable 1 (V1) domain of Env gp120. We demonstrate the presence of this O-glycosylation both on virions and on gp120 expressed as a secreted protein. Further, we establish that these O-linked glycans can confer a more than 1,000-fold decrease in neutralization sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) to V3-glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies. These findings uncover a structural modification to the HIV-1 Env and suggest a functional role in promoting viral escape from one category of broadly neutralizing antibodies."	0
"31585693"	"A Diversity of Selective Autophagy Receptors Determines the Specificity of the Autophagy Pathway.The clearance of surplus, broken, or dangerous components is key for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The failure to remove protein aggregates, damaged organelles, or intracellular pathogens leads to diseases, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and infectious diseases. Autophagy is the evolutionarily conserved pathway that sequesters cytoplasmic components in specialized vesicles, autophagosomes, which transport the cargo to the degradative compartments (vacuoles or lysosomes). Research during the past few decades has elucidated how autophagosomes engulf their substrates selectively. This type of autophagy involves a growing number of selective autophagy receptors (SARs) (e.g., Atg19 in yeasts, p62/SQSTM1 in mammals), which bind to the cargo and simultaneously engage components of the core autophagic machinery via direct interaction with the ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) of the Atg8/LC3/GABARAP family and adaptors, Atg11 (in yeasts) or FIP200 (in mammals). In this Review, we critically discuss the biology of the SARs with special emphasis on their interactions with UBLs."	0
"32763226"	"Primary Role of the Nucleosome.Whereas the core nucleosome is thought to serve as a packaging device for the coiling and contraction in length of genomic DNA, we suggest that it serves primarily in the regulation of transcription. A nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription. The association of nucleosomes with most genomic DNA prevents initiation from cryptic promoters. The nucleosome thus serves not only as a general gene repressor, but also as a repressor of all transcription (genic, intragenic, and intergenic). The core nucleosome performs a fundamental regulatory role, apart from the histone ""tails,"" which modulate gene activity."	0
"32075761"	"Hypoxia Produces Pro-arrhythmic Late Sodium Current in Cardiac Myocytes by SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 Channels.Acute cardiac hypoxia produces life-threatening elevations in late sodium current (I<sub>LATE</sub>) in the human heart. Here, we show the underlying mechanism: hypoxia induces rapid SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels so they reopen when normally inactive, late in the action potential. Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 is SUMOylated only on lysine 442, and the mutation of that residue, or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme, prevents hypoxic reopenings. The time course of SUMOylation of single channels in response to hypoxia coincides with the increase in I<sub>LATE</sub>, a reaction that is complete in under 100 s. In human cardiac myocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells, hypoxia-induced I<sub>LATE</sub> is confirmed to be SUMO-dependent and to produce action potential prolongation, the pro-arrhythmic change observed in patients."	0
"32160553"	"The FTLD Risk Factor TMEM106B Regulates the Transport of Lysosomes at the Axon Initial Segment of Motoneurons.Genetic variations in TMEM106B, coding for a lysosomal membrane protein, affect frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in GRN- (coding for progranulin) and C9orf72-expansion carriers and might play a role in aging. To determine the physiological function of TMEM106B, we generated TMEM106B-deficient mice. These mice develop proximal axonal swellings caused by drastically enlarged LAMP1-positive vacuoles, increased retrograde axonal transport of lysosomes, and accumulation of lipofuscin and autophagosomes. Giant vacuoles specifically accumulate at the distal end and within the axon initial segment, but not in peripheral nerves or at axon terminals, resulting in an impaired facial-nerve-dependent motor performance. These data implicate TMEM106B in mediating the axonal transport of LAMP1-positive organelles in motoneurons and axonal sorting at the initial segment. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how TMEM106B affects lysosomal proteolysis and degradative capacity in neurons."	0

"32698000"	"Cohesin-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms Mediate Chromosomal Contacts between Promoters and Enhancers.It is currently assumed that 3D chromosomal organization plays a central role in transcriptional control. However, depletion of cohesin and CTCF affects the steady-state levels of only a minority of transcripts. Here, we use high-resolution Capture Hi-C to interrogate the dynamics of chromosomal contacts of all annotated human gene promoters upon degradation of cohesin and CTCF. We show that a majority of promoter-anchored contacts are lost in these conditions, but many contacts with distinct properties are maintained, and some new ones are gained. The rewiring of contacts between promoters and active enhancers upon cohesin degradation associates with rapid changes in target gene transcription as detected by SLAM sequencing (SLAM-seq). These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited, but consistent, effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on steady-state transcription and suggest the existence of both cohesin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of enhancer-promoter pairing."	0
"32726628"	"Dissecting Murine Muscle Stem Cell Aging through Regeneration Using Integrative Genomic Analysis.During aging, there is a progressive loss of volume and function in skeletal muscle that impacts mobility and quality of life. The repair of skeletal muscle is regulated by tissue-resident stem cells called satellite cells (or muscle stem cells [MuSCs]), but in aging, MuSCs decrease in numbers and regenerative capacity. The transcriptional networks and epigenetic changes that confer diminished regenerative function in MuSCs as a result of natural aging are only partially understood. Herein, we use an integrative genomics approach to profile MuSCs from young and aged animals before and after injury. Integration of these datasets reveals aging impacts multiple regulatory changes through significant differences in gene expression, metabolic flux, chromatin accessibility, and patterns of transcription factor (TF) binding activities. Collectively, these datasets facilitate a deeper understanding of the regulation tissue-resident stem cells use during aging and healing."	0
"32726632"	"Control of Viral Infection by Natural Killer Cell Inhibitory Receptors.Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted immune responses are largely attributed to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, natural killer (NK) cells, as predicted by the missing-self hypothesis, have opposing requirements for MHC-I, suggesting that they may also demonstrate MHC-I-restricted effects. In mice, the Ly49 inhibitory receptors prevent NK cell killing of missing-self targets in effector responses, and they have a proposed second function in licensing or educating NK cells via self-MHC-I in vivo. Here we show MHC-I-restricted control of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in vivo that is NK cell dependent. Using mice lacking specific Ly49 receptors, we show that control of MCMV requires inhibitory Ly49 receptors and an inhibitory signaling motif and the capacity for MCMV to downregulate MHC-I. Taken together, these data provide definitive evidence that the inhibitory receptors are required for missing-self rejection and are relevant to MHC-I-restricted NK cell control of a viral infection in vivo."	0

We reveal that loss of the tumour suppressive transcription factor Elf5 in TNBC cells activates intrinsic interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signalling, promoting tumour progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, we find that loss of the Elf5-regulated ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 ensures stabilization of its putative protein substrate IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) at the protein level in TNBC. Elf5<sup>low</sup> tumours show enhanced IFN-γ signalling accompanied by an increase of immunosuppressive neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment and increased programmed death ligand 1 expression. Inactivation of either programmed death ligand 1 or IFNGR1 elicited a robust anti-tumour and/or anti-metastatic effect. A positive correlation between ELF5 and FBXW7 expression and a negative correlation between ELF5, FBXW7 and IFNGR1 expression in the tumours of patients with TNBC strongly suggest that this signalling axis could be exploited for patient stratification and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for Elf5<sup>low</sup> patients with TNBC."	0
"32697990"	"Interplay between Extracellular Matrix Stiffness and JAM-A Regulates Mechanical Load on ZO-1 and Tight Junction Assembly.Tight-junction-regulated actomyosin activity determines epithelial and endothelial tension on adherens junctions and drives morphogenetic processes; however, whether or not tight junctions themselves are under tensile stress is not clear. Here, we use a tension sensor based on ZO-1, a scaffolding protein that links the junctional membrane to the cytoskeleton, to determine if tight junctions carry a mechanical load. Our data indicate that ZO-1 is under mechanical tension and that forces acting on ZO-1 are regulated by extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and the junctional adhesion molecule JAM-A. JAM-A depletion stimulates junctional recruitment of p114RhoGEF/ARHGEF18, mechanical tension on ZO-1, and traction forces at focal adhesions. p114RhoGEF is required for activation of junctional actomyosin activity and tight junction integrity on stiff but not soft ECM. Thus, junctional ZO-1 bears a mechanical load, and junction assembly is regulated by interplay between the physical properties of the ECM and adhesion-regulated signaling at tight junctions."	0
"32444496"	"The BAR domain of the Arf GTPase-activating protein ASAP1 directly binds actin filaments.The Arf GTPase-activating protein (Arf GAP) with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat and PH domain 1 (ASAP1) establishes a connection between the cell membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The formation, maintenance, and turnover of actin filaments and bundles in the actin cortex are important for cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. Here, using actin cosedimentation, polymerization, and depolymerization assays, along with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), confocal, and EM analyses, we show that the N-terminal N-BAR domain of ASAP1 directly binds to F-actin. We found that ASAP1 homodimerization aligns F-actin in predominantly unipolar bundles and stabilizes them against depolymerization. Furthermore, the ASAP1 N-BAR domain moderately reduced the spontaneous polymerization of G-actin. The overexpression of the ASAP1 BAR-PH tandem domain in fibroblasts induced the formation of actin-filled projections more effectively than did full-length ASAP1. An ASAP1 construct that lacked the N-BAR domain failed to induce cellular projections. Our results suggest that ASAP1 regulates the dynamics and the formation of higher-order actin structures, possibly through direct binding to F-actin via its N-BAR domain. We propose that ASAP1 is a hub protein for dynamic protein-protein interactions in mechanosensitive structures, such as focal adhesions, invadopodia, and podosomes, that are directly implicated in oncogenic events. The effect of ASAP1 on actin dynamics puts a spotlight on its function as a central signaling molecule that regulates the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by transmitting signals from the plasma membrane."	0

Agonists for nuclear receptors PPARα and PPARγ both affect brown adipocyte function, yet the interplay between these factors in BAT is uncertain. Here, we report that PPARα shares most genomic binding sites with PPARγ, and these common binding sites are more related to BAT function than PPARγ-selective sites without PPARα. Integrating PPARα and PPARγ genomic occupancy with cold-responsive BAT transcriptomes identifies a subset of 16 genes with potential relevance to BAT function. Among these, we focused on the lysosomal protease cathepsin Z (CTSZ) and showed it is necessary for mitochondrial respiration in both mouse and human brown adipocytes.

"32393888"	"NFI transcription factors provide chromatin access to maintain stem cell identity while preventing unintended lineage fate choices.Tissue homeostasis and regeneration rely on resident stem cells (SCs), whose behaviour is regulated through niche-dependent crosstalk. The mechanisms underlying SC identity are still unfolding. Here, using spatiotemporal gene ablation in murine hair follicles, we uncover a critical role for the transcription factors (TFs) nuclear factor IB (NFIB) and IX (NFIX) in maintaining SC identity. Without NFI TFs, SCs lose their hair-regenerating capability, and produce skin bearing striking resemblance to irreversible human alopecia, which also displays reduced NFIs. Through single-cell transcriptomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq profiling, we expose a key role for NFIB and NFIX in governing super-enhancer maintenance of the key hair follicle SC-specific TF genes. When NFIB and NFIX are genetically removed, the stemness epigenetic landscape is lost. Super-enhancers driving SC identity are decommissioned, while unwanted lineages are de-repressed ectopically. Together, our findings expose NFIB and NFIX as crucial rheostats of tissue homeostasis, functioning to safeguard the SC epigenome from a breach in lineage confinement that otherwise triggers irreversible tissue degeneration."	0

Dysfunctions of gene-deficient microglia contribute to the development and progression of multiple CNS diseases. Microglia replacement by nonself cells has been proposed to treat microglia-associated disorders. However, some attempts have failed due to low replacement efficiency, such as with the traditional bone marrow transplantation approach. In this study, we develop three efficient strategies for microglia replacement: microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (mrBMT), microglia replacement by peripheral blood (mrPB), and microglia replacement by microglia transplantation (mrMT). mrBMT and mrPB allow microglia-like cells to efficiently replace resident microglia in the whole CNS. On the other hand, mrMT achieves microglia replacement in brain regions of interest. In summary, the present study offers effective tactics for microglia replacement with diverse application scenarios, which potentially opens up a window on treating microglia-associated CNS disorders."	0

"32487747"	"How the assembly and protection of the bacterial cell envelope depend on cysteine residues.The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a multilayered structure essential for bacterial viability; the peptidoglycan cell wall provides shape and osmotic protection to the cell, and the outer membrane serves as a permeability barrier against noxious compounds in the external environment. Assembling the envelope properly and maintaining its integrity are matters of life and death for bacteria. Our understanding of the mechanisms of envelope assembly and maintenance has increased tremendously over the past two decades. Here, we review the major achievements made during this time, giving central stage to the amino acid cysteine, one of the least abundant amino acid residues in proteins, whose unique chemical and physical properties often critically support biological processes. First, we review how cysteines contribute to envelope homeostasis by forming stabilizing disulfides in crucial bacterial assembly factors (LptD, BamA, and FtsN) and stress sensors (RcsF and NlpE). Second, we highlight the emerging role of enzymes that use cysteine residues to catalyze reactions that are necessary for proper envelope assembly, and we also explain how these enzymes are protected from oxidative inactivation. Finally, we suggest future areas of investigation, including a discussion of how cysteine residues could contribute to envelope homeostasis by functioning as redox switches. By highlighting the redox pathways that are active in the envelope of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we provide a timely overview of the assembly of a cellular compartment that is the hallmark of Gram-negative bacteria."	0

Here, we demonstrate that TMEM16F governs a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance in spinal motoneurons. We show that TMEM16F is expressed in synaptic clusters facing pre-synaptic cholinergic C-boutons in α-motoneurons of the spinal cord. Mice with targeted exon deletion in Tmem16f display decreased motor performance under high-demanding tasks attributable to an increase in the recruitment threshold of fast α-motoneurons. Remarkably, loss of TMEM16F function in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) significantly reduces expression of an activity-dependent early stress marker and muscle denervation, delays disease onset, and preserves muscular strength only in male ALS mice. Thus, TMEM16F controls motoneuron excitability and impacts motor resistance as well as motor deterioration in ALS."	0
"32001510"	"Mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling drives formation of cytoplasmic chromatin and inflammation in senescence.Cellular senescence is a potent tumor suppressor mechanism but also contributes to aging and aging-related diseases. Senescence is characterized by a stable cell cycle arrest and a complex proinflammatory secretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently discovered that cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), extruded from the nucleus of senescent cells, trigger the SASP through activation of the innate immunity cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. However, the upstream signaling events that instigate CCF formation remain unknown. Here, we show that dysfunctional mitochondria, linked to down-regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, trigger a ROS-JNK retrograde signaling pathway that drives CCF formation and hence the SASP. JNK links to 53BP1, a nuclear protein that negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection and CCF formation. Importantly, we show that low-dose HDAC inhibitors restore expression of most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, improve mitochondrial function, and suppress CCFs and the SASP in senescent cells. In mouse models, HDAC inhibitors also suppress oxidative stress, CCF, inflammation, and tissue damage caused by senescence-inducing irradiation and/or acetaminophen-induced mitochondria dysfunction. Overall, our findings outline an extended mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway that initiates formation of CCF during senescence and is a potential target for drug-based interventions to inhibit the proaging SASP."	0
"32006464"	"Localized Inhibition of Protein Phosphatase 1 by NUAK1 Promotes Spliceosome Activity and Reveals a MYC-Sensitive Feedback Control of Transcription.Deregulated expression of MYC induces a dependence on the NUAK1 kinase, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this dependence have not been fully clarified. Here, we show that NUAK1 is a predominantly nuclear protein that associates with a network of nuclear protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interactors and that PNUTS, a nuclear regulatory subunit of PP1, is phosphorylated by NUAK1. Both NUAK1 and PNUTS associate with the splicing machinery. Inhibition of NUAK1 abolishes chromatin association of PNUTS, reduces spliceosome activity, and suppresses nascent RNA synthesis. Activation of MYC does not bypass the requirement for NUAK1 for spliceosome activity but significantly attenuates transcription inhibition. Consequently, NUAK1 inhibition in MYC-transformed cells induces global accumulation of RNAPII both at the pause site and at the first exon-intron boundary but does not increase mRNA synthesis. We suggest that NUAK1 inhibition in the presence of deregulated MYC traps non-productive RNAPII because of the absence of correctly assembled spliceosomes."	1
"30979585"	"Structural and Functional Insights into Host Death Domains Inactivation by the Bacterial Arginine GlcNAcyltransferase Effector.Enteropathogenic E. coli NleB and related type III effectors catalyze arginine GlcNAcylation of death domain (DD) proteins to block host defense, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we solve crystal structures of NleB alone and in complex with FADD-DD, UDP, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> as well as NleB-GlcNAcylated DDs of TRADD and RIPK1. NleB adopts a GT-A fold with a unique helix-pair insertion to hold FADD-DD; the interface contacts explain the selectivity of NleB for certain DDs. The acceptor arginine is fixed into a cleft, in which Glu253 serves as a base to activate the guanidinium. Analyses of the enzyme-substrate complex and the product structures reveal an inverting sugar-transfer reaction and a detailed catalytic mechanism. These structural insights are validated by mutagenesis analyses of NleB-mediated GlcNAcylation in vitro and its function in mouse infection. Our study builds a structural framework for understanding of NleB-catalyzed arginine GlcNAcylation of host death domain."	0
"31968259"	"Inactivation Kinetics and Mechanical Gating of Piezo1 Ion Channels Depend on Subdomains within the Cap.Piezo1 ion channels are activated by mechanical stimuli and mediate the sensing of blood flow. Although cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have revealed the overall architecture of Piezo1, the precise domains involved in activation and subsequent inactivation have remained elusive. Here, we perform a targeted chimeric screen between Piezo1 and the closely related isoform Piezo2 and use electrophysiology to characterize their inactivation kinetics during mechanical stimulation. We identify three small subdomains within the extracellular cap that individually can confer the distinct kinetics of inactivation of Piezo2 onto Piezo1. We further show by cysteine crosslinking that conformational flexibility of these subdomains is required for mechanical activation to occur and that electrostatic interactions functionally couple the cap to the extensive blades, which have been proposed to function as sensors of membrane curvature and tension. This study provides a demonstration of internal gating motions involved in mechanotransduction by Piezo1."	0

We develop an inducible mouse model for the sequential ablation of UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown and brite/beige adipocytes in adult mice. We demonstrate that activated brown adipocytes can increase systemic energy expenditure (EE) by 30%, while the contribution of brite/beige UCP1<sup>+</sup> cells is <5%. Notably, UCP1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes do not contribute to circulating FGF21 levels, either at room temperature or after cold exposure. We demonstrate that the FGF21-mediated effects on EE and glucose homeostasis are partially dependent on the presence of UCP1<sup>+</sup> cells, while the effect on weight loss is not. In conclusion, acute UCP1<sup>+</sup> cell deletion may be a useful model to study the impact of brown and brite/beige adipocytes on metabolism."	0

However, the molecular players and the mechanisms regulating the gene-specific expression of tRNAs are still unknown. Using an inducible auxin-degron system to rapidly deplete RPB1 (the largest subunit of RNA Pol II) in living cells, we identified Pol II as a direct gene-specific regulator of tRNA transcription. Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes. This activity was further found to be essential for MAF1-mediated repression of a large set of tRNA genes during serum starvation, indicating that repression of tRNA genes by Pol II is dynamically regulated. Hence, Pol II plays a direct and central role in the gene-specific regulation of tRNA expression."	0

We investigate the role of autophagy in equipping human memory T cells to acquire tissue residence and maintain functionality in the immunosuppressive liver environment. By performing ex vivo staining of freshly isolated cells from human liver tissue, we find that an increased rate of basal autophagy is a hallmark of intrahepatic lymphocytes, particularly liver-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with increased autophagy are those best able to proliferate and mediate cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Conversely, blocking autophagy induction results in the accumulation of depolarized mitochondria, a feature of exhausted T cells. Primary hepatic stellate cells or the prototypic hepatic cytokine interleukin (IL)-15 induce autophagy in parallel with tissue-homing/retention markers. Inhibition of T cell autophagy abrogates tissue-residence programming. Thus, upregulation of autophagy adapts CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to combat mitochondrial depolarization, optimize functionality, and acquire tissue residence."	0
"32521259"	"Computationally Guided Intracerebral Drug Delivery via Chronically Implanted Microdevices.Treatments for neurologic diseases are often limited in efficacy due to poor spatial and temporal control over their delivery. Intracerebral delivery partially overcomes this by directly infusing therapeutics to the brain. Brain structures, however, are nonuniform and irregularly shaped, precluding complete target coverage by a single bolus without significant off-target effects and possible toxicity. Nearly complete coverage is crucial for effective modulation of these structures. We present a framework with computational mapping algorithms for neural drug delivery (COMMAND) to guide multi-bolus targeting of brain structures that maximizes coverage and minimizes off-target leakage. Custom-fabricated chronic neural implants leverage rational fluidic design to achieve multi-bolus delivery in rodents through a single infusion of radioactive tracer (Cu-64). The resulting spatial distributions replicate computed spatial coverage with 5% error in vivo, as detected by positron emission tomography. COMMAND potentially enables accurate, efficacious targeting of discrete brain regions."	0

Skeletal muscle regenerative capacity relies on muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) and their interplay with different cell types within the niche. However, our understanding of skeletal muscle tissue cellular composition is limited. Here, using a combined approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, we precisely mapped 10 different mononuclear cell types in adult mouse muscle. We also characterized gene signatures and determined key discriminating markers of each cell type. We identified two previously understudied cell populations in the interstitial compartment. One expresses the transcription factor scleraxis and generated tenocytes in vitro. The second expresses markers of smooth muscle and mesenchymal cells (SMMCs) and, while distinct from MuSCs, exhibited myogenic potential and promoted MuSC engraftment following transplantation. The blueprint presented here yields crucial insights into muscle-resident cell-type identities and can be exploited to study muscle diseases."	0
"31914396"	"Molecular Mechanism of RNA Recognition by Zinc-Finger Antiviral Protein.Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host antiviral factor that specifically restricts a wide range of viruses. ZAP selectively binds to CG-dinucleotide-enriched RNA sequences and recruits multiple RNA degradation machines to degrade target viral RNA. However, the molecular mechanism and structural basis for ZAP recognition of specific RNA are not clear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ZAP N-terminal domain bound to a CG-rich single-stranded RNA, providing the molecular basis for its specific recognition of a CG dinucleotide and additional guanine and cytosine. The four zinc fingers of ZAP adopt a unique architecture and form extensive interactions with RNA. Mutations of both protein and RNA at the RNA-ZAP interacting surface reduce the in vitro binding affinity and cellular antiviral activity. This work reveals the molecular mechanism of ZAP recognition of specific target RNA and also provides insights into the mechanism by which ZAP coordinates downstream RNA degradation processes."	0
"31471187"	"Co-temporal Force and Fluorescence Measurements Reveal a Ribosomal Gear Shift Mechanism of Translation Regulation by Structured mRNAs.The movement of ribosomes on mRNA is often interrupted by secondary structures that present mechanical barriers and play a central role in translation regulation. We investigate how ribosomes couple their internal conformational changes with the activity of translocation factor EF-G to unwind mRNA secondary structures using high-resolution optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence capability. We find that hairpin opening occurs during EF-G-catalyzed translocation and is driven by the forward rotation of the small subunit head. Modulating the magnitude of the hairpin barrier by force shows that ribosomes respond to strong barriers by shifting their operation to an alternative 7-fold-slower kinetic pathway prior to translocation. Shifting into a slow gear results from an allosteric switch in the ribosome that may allow it to exploit thermal fluctuations to overcome mechanical barriers. Finally, we observe that ribosomes occasionally open the hairpin in two successive sub-codon steps, revealing a previously unobserved translocation intermediate."	0

Phosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A<sub>C</sub>) at tyrosine 307 has been claimed to inactivate PP2A and was examined in more than 180 studies using commercial antibodies, but this modification was never identified using mass spectrometry. Here we show that the most cited pTyr<sup>307</sup> monoclonal antibodies, E155 and F-8, are not specific for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>307</sup> but instead are hampered by PP2A<sub>C</sub> methylation at leucine 309 or phosphorylation at threonine 304.

We identify pTyr<sup>307</sup> using targeted mass spectrometry after transient overexpression of PP2A<sub>C</sub> and Src kinase. Yet under such conditions, none of the tested antibodies show exclusive pTyr<sup>307</sup> specificity.

Numerical and computational methods for dimensionality reduction allow for low-dimensional representation of genome-scale expression data for downstream clustering, trajectory reconstruction, and biological interpretation. However, a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the performance of these techniques has not been established. We present an unbiased framework that defines metrics of global and local structure preservation in dimensionality reduction transformations. Using discrete and continuous real-world and synthetic scRNA-seq datasets, we show how input cell distribution and method parameters are largely determinant of global, local, and organizational data structure preservation by 11 common dimensionality reduction methods."	0
"32032531"	"Imprinted Maternally Expressed microRNAs Antagonize Paternally Driven Gene Programs in Neurons.Imprinted genes with parental-biased allelic expression are frequently co-regulated and enriched in common biological pathways. Here, we functionally characterize a large cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed from the maternally inherited allele (""maternally expressed"") to explore the molecular and cellular consequences of imprinted miRNA activity. Using an induced neuron (iN) culture system, we show that maternally expressed miRNAs from the miR-379/410 cluster direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to transcriptional and developmental regulators, including paternally expressed transcripts like Plagl1. Maternal deletion of this imprinted miRNA cluster resulted in increased protein levels of several targets and upregulation of a broader transcriptional program regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal function. A subset of the transcriptional changes resulting from miR-379/410 deletion can be attributed to de-repression of Plagl1. These data suggest maternally expressed miRNAs antagonize paternally driven gene programs in neurons."	0
"31256988"	"Catalytically Active Cas9 Mediates Transcriptional Interference to Facilitate Bacterial Virulence.In addition to defense against foreign DNA, the CRISPR-Cas9 system of Francisella novicida represses expression of an endogenous immunostimulatory lipoprotein. We investigated the specificity and molecular mechanism of this regulation, demonstrating that Cas9 controls a highly specific regulon of four genes that must be repressed for bacterial virulence. Regulation occurs through a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent interaction of Cas9 with its endogenous DNA targets, dependent on a non-canonical small RNA (scaRNA) and tracrRNA. The limited complementarity between scaRNA and the endogenous DNA targets precludes cleavage, highlighting the evolution of scaRNA to repress transcription without lethally targeting the chromosome. We show that scaRNA can be reprogrammed to repress other genes, and with engineered, extended complementarity to an exogenous target, the repurposed scaRNA:tracrRNA-FnoCas9 machinery can also direct DNA cleavage. Natural Cas9 transcriptional interference likely represents a broad paradigm of regulatory functionality, which is potentially critical to the physiology of numerous Cas9-encoding pathogenic and commensal organisms."	0
"32937126"	"Single Nucleotide Resolution Analysis Reveals Pervasive, Long-Lasting DNA Methylation Changes by Developmental Exposure to a Mitochondrial Toxicant.Mitochondrial-driven alterations of the epigenome have been reported, but whether they are relevant at the organismal level remains unknown. The viable yellow agouti mouse (A<sup>vy</sup>) is a powerful epigenetic biosensor model that reports on the DNA methylation status of the A<sup>vy</sup> locus, which is established prior to the three-germ-layer separation, through the coat color of the animals. Here we show that maternal exposure to rotenone, a potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, not only changes the DNA methylation status of the A<sup>vy</sup> locus in the skin but broadly affects the liver DNA methylome of the offspring. These effects are accompanied by altered gene expression programs that persist throughout life, and which associate with impairment of antioxidant activity and mitochondrial function in aged animals. These pervasive and lasting genomic effects suggest a putative role for mitochondria in regulating life-long gene expression programs through developmental nuclear epigenetic remodeling."	0
"32669361"	"A comprehensive analysis of Rab GTPases reveals a role for Rab34 in serum starvation-induced primary ciliogenesis.Primary cilia are sensors of chemical and mechanical signals in the extracellular environment. The formation of primary cilia (<i>i.e.</i> ciliogenesis) requires dynamic membrane trafficking events, and several Rab small GTPases, key regulators of membrane trafficking, have recently been reported to participate in ciliogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms of Rab-mediated membrane trafficking during ciliogenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used a collection of siRNAs against 62 human Rabs to perform a comprehensive knockdown screening for Rabs that regulate serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in human telomerase reverse transcriptase retinal pigment epithelium 1 (hTERT-RPE1) cells and succeeded in identifying Rab34 as an essential Rab. Knockout (KO) of Rab34, but not of Rabs previously reported to regulate ciliogenesis (<i>e.g.</i> Rab8 and Rab10) in hTERT-RPE1 cells, drastically impaired serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis. Rab34 was also required for serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in NIH/3T3 cells and MCF10A cells but not for ciliogenesis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II cysts. We then attempted to identify a specific region(s) of Rab34 that is essential for ciliogenesis by performing deletion and mutation analyses of Rab34. Unexpectedly, instead of a specific sequence in the switch II region, which is generally important for recognizing effector proteins (<i>e.g.</i> Rab interacting lysosomal protein [RILP]), a unique long N-terminal region of Rab34 before the conserved GTPase domain was found to be essential. These findings suggest that Rab34 is an atypical Rab that regulates serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis through its unique N-terminal region."	0

"31447391"	"α-Ketoglutarate-Activated NF-κB Signaling Promotes Compensatory Glucose Uptake and Brain Tumor Development.The rapid proliferation of cancer cells and dysregulated vasculature within the tumor leads to limited nutrient accessibility. Cancer cells often rewire their metabolic pathways for adaption to nutrient stress, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) is a key enzyme in glutaminolysis that converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Here, we show that, under low glucose, GDH1 is phosphorylated at serine (S) 384 and interacts with RelA and IKKβ. GDH1-produced α-KG directly binds to and activates IKKβ and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which promotes glucose uptake and tumor cell survival by upregulating GLUT1, thereby accelerating gliomagenesis. In addition, GDH1 S384 phosphorylation correlates with the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma. Our finding reveals a unique role of α-KG to directly regulate signal pathway, uncovers a distinct mechanism of metabolite-mediated NF-κB activation, and also establishes the critical role of α-KG-activated NF-κB in brain tumor development."	0

While previous studies of pioneer factors have revealed their functions in transcriptional regulation, pioneer factors that open chromatin for other physiological events remain undetermined. In this issue of <i>Genes & Development</i>, Spruce and colleagues (pp. 398-412) report the functional significance of a ""pioneer complex"" in mouse meiotic recombination. This complex, comprised of the zinc finger DNA-binding protein PRDM9 and the SNF2 family chromatin remodeler HELLS, exposes nucleosomal DNA to designate the sites of DNA double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination. Both HELLS and PRDM9 are required for the determination of these recombination hot spots. Through the identification of a pioneer complex for meiotic recombination, this study broadens the conceptual scope of pioneer factors, indicating their functional significance in biological processes beyond transcriptional regulation."	0

However, molecular mechanisms governing ER stress-induced ER-phagy remain insufficiently understood. Here we report that ER stress-induced ER-phagy in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires Epr1, a soluble Atg8-interacting ER-phagy receptor. Epr1 localizes to the ER through interacting with integral ER membrane proteins VAPs. Bridging an Atg8-VAP association is the main ER-phagy role of Epr1, as it can be bypassed by an artificial Atg8-VAP tether. VAPs contribute to ER-phagy not only by tethering Atg8 to the ER membrane, but also by maintaining the ER-plasma membrane contact. Epr1 is upregulated during ER stress by the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator Ire1. Loss of Epr1 reduces survival against ER stress. Conversely, increasing Epr1 expression suppresses the ER-phagy defect and ER stress sensitivity of cells lacking Ire1. Our findings expand and deepen the molecular understanding of ER-phagy."	0
"32640221"	"Inflammation-Induced Lactate Leads to Rapid Loss of Hepatic Tissue-Resident NK Cells.The liver harbors two main innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations: conventional NK (cNK) cells and tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells. Using the MCMV model of infection, we find that, in contrast to liver cNK cells, trNK cells initially undergo a contraction phase followed by a recovery phase to homeostatic levels. The contraction is MCMV independent because a similar phenotype is observed following poly(I:C)/CpG or α-GalCer injection. The rapid contraction phase is due to apoptosis, whereas the recovery phase occurs via proliferation in situ. Interestingly, trNK cell apoptosis is not mediated by fratricide and not induced by liver lymphocytes or inflammatory cytokines. Instead, we find that trNK cell apoptosis is the consequence of an increased sensitivity to lactic acid. Mechanistic analysis indicates that trNK cell sensitivity to lactate is linked to impaired mitochondrial function. These findings underscore the distinctive properties of the liver-resident NK cell compartment."	0

Here, we combine independent component analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from diverse cell types and model systems with time-resolved mapping of EWSR1-FLI1 binding sites and of open chromatin regions to characterize dynamic cellular processes associated with EWSR1-FLI1 activity. We thus define an exquisitely specific and direct enhancer-driven EWSR1-FLI1 program. In EwS tumors, cell proliferation and strong oxidative phosphorylation metabolism are associated with a well-defined range of EWSR1-FLI1 activity. In contrast, a subpopulation of cells from below and above the intermediary EWSR1-FLI1 activity is characterized by increased hypoxia.

We report four cryo-EM reconstructions of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase representing the entire reaction pathway: (1) a backtracked complex; a backtracked complex with GreB (2) before and (3) after RNA cleavage; and (4) a reactivated, substrate-bound complex with GreB before RNA extension. Compared with eukaryotes, the backtracked RNA adopts a different conformation. RNA polymerase conformational changes cause distinct GreB states: a fully engaged GreB before cleavage; a disengaged GreB after cleavage; and a dislodged, loosely bound GreB removed from the active site to allow RNA extension. These reconstructions provide insight into the catalytic mechanism and dynamics of RNA cleavage and extension and suggest how GreB targets backtracked complexes without interfering with canonical transcription."	0

However, prior work indicates that cancer cells are more resistant to brief pulses of high-level FSS in vitro relative to non-transformed epithelial cells. Herein, we identify a mechano-adaptive mechanism of FSS resistance in cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that cancer cells activate RhoA in response to FSS, which protects them from FSS-induced plasma membrane damage. We show that cancer cells freshly isolated from mouse and human tumors are resistant to FSS, that formin and myosin II activity protects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from destruction, and that short-term inhibition of myosin II delays metastasis in mouse models. Collectively, our data indicate that viable CTCs actively resist destruction by hemodynamic forces and are likely to be more mechanically robust than is commonly thought."	0

To analyze rhinovirus-specific B cell responses in humans, we developed techniques using intact RV-A16 and RV-A39 for high-throughput high-dimensional single-cell analysis, with parallel assessment of antibody isotypes in an experimental infection model. Our approach identified T-bet+ B cells binding both viruses that account for ∼5% of CXCR5- memory B cells. These B cells infiltrate nasal tissue and expand in the blood after infection. Their rapid secretion of heterotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vitro, but not IgA, matches the nasal antibody profile post-infection. By contrast, CXCR5+ memory B cells binding a single virus are clonally distinct, absent in nasal tissue, and secrete homotypic IgG and IgA, mirroring the systemic response. Temporal and spatial functions of dichotomous memory B cells might explain the ability to resolve infection while rendering the host susceptible to re-infection."	0

Here, we develop selective 40S footprinting to visualize initiating 40S ribosomes on endogenous mRNAs in vivo. This reveals the positions on mRNAs where initiation factors join the ribosome to act and where they leave. We discover that in most human cells, most scanning ribosomes remain attached to the 5' cap. Consequently, only one ribosome scans a 5' UTR at a time, and 5' UTR length affects translation efficiency. We discover that eukaryotic initiation factor 3B (eIF3B,) eIF4G1, and eIF4E remain bound to 80S ribosomes as they begin translating, with a decay half-length of ∼12 codons. Hence, ribosomes retain these initiation factors while translating short upstream open reading frames (uORFs), providing an explanation for how ribosomes can reinitiate translation after uORFs in humans.

How metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. In melanoma, downregulation of the lineage addiction oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, although how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here, we show that MITF is a lineage-restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and that SCD is required for MITF<sup>High</sup> melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITF<sup>Low</sup> cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signaling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback loop that maintains de-differentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineage-specific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates the response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism."	1

Using mixed bone marrow chimeras and lymphocyte-repopulated Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice proves that wild-type (WT), but not Foxo3-deficient T cells provoke GC B cell maturation and antibody production.

The loss of DmCFL also results in the formation of sarcomeric protein aggregates and impairs sarcomere addition during growth. The activation of the proteasome delays muscle deterioration in our model. Furthermore, we investigate how a point mutation in CFL2 that causes nemaline myopathy (NM) in humans affects CFL function and leads to the muscle phenotypes observed in vivo.

We show that DNA sequences encoding TF binding site number, density, and affinity above sharply defined thresholds drive condensation of TFs and coactivators. A combination of specific structured (TF-DNA) and weak multivalent (TF-coactivator) interactions allows for condensates to form at particular genomic loci determined by the DNA sequence and the complement of expressed TFs.

In this study, we identified leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) as an essential regulator of early hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs. The deletion of LGR4 severely impairs mesoderm development, thereby limiting hematopoietic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, LGR5 is dispensable for hPSC hematopoiesis. The four R-spondin proteins show differential activities and dependencies on LGR4 in hematopoietic differentiation. The deletion of LGR4 almost entirely abolishes the enhancement induced by R-spondin1 and R-spondin3, but not R-spondin2. In addition, ZNRF3 is required for the response of R-spondin1-R-spondin3. At the mechanistic level, LGR4 regulates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling to control hematopoietic differentiation. Together, our results reveal vital roles of LGR4 in hematopoietic development and uncover distinct functions and underlying mechanisms for R-spondins."	1
"32375038"	"Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision.Ribosome movement is not always smooth and is rather often impeded. For ribosome pauses, fundamental issues remain to be addressed, including where ribosomes pause on mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid sequence causes this pause, and the physiological significance of this attenuation of protein synthesis. Here, we survey the positions of ribosome collisions caused by ribosome pauses in humans and zebrafish using modified ribosome profiling. Collided ribosomes, i.e., disomes, emerge at various sites: Pro-Pro/Gly/Asp motifs; Arg-X-Lys motifs; stop codons; and 3' untranslated regions. The electrostatic interaction between the charged nascent chain and the ribosome exit tunnel determines the eIF5A-mediated disome rescue at the Pro-Pro sites. In particular, XBP1u, a precursor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-responsive transcription factor, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes and thus acts as a degradation substrate by ribosome-associated quality control. Our results provide insight into the causes and consequences of ribosome pause by dissecting collided ribosomes."	0

"32541877"	"The protein kinase Akt acts as a coat adaptor in endocytic recycling.Coat proteins have a central role in vesicular transport by binding to cargoes for their sorting into intracellular pathways. Cargo recognition is mediated by components of the coat complex known as adaptor proteins<sup>1-3</sup>. We previously showed that Arf-GAP with coil-coil, ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1 (ACAP1) functions as an adaptor for a clathrin coat complex that has a function in endocytic recycling<sup>4-6</sup>. Here, we show that the protein kinase Akt acts as a co-adaptor in this complex, and is needed in conjunction with ACAP1 to bind to cargo proteins to promote their recycling. In addition to advancing the understanding of endocytic recycling, we uncover a fundamentally different function in which a kinase acts, as Akt in this case is an effector rather than a regulator in a cellular event."	1
"32579920"	"Hunger Potentiates the Habenular Winner Pathway for Social Conflict by Orexin-Promoted Biased Alternative Splicing of the AMPA Receptor Gene.Many animals fight for dominance between conspecifics. Because winners could obtain more resources than losers, fighting outcomes are important for the animal's survival, especially in a situation with insufficient resources, such as hunger. However, it remains unclear whether and how hunger affects fighting outcomes. Herein, we investigate the effects of food deprivation on brain activity and fighting behaviors in zebrafish. We report that starvation induces winning in social conflicts. Before the fights, starved fish show potentiation of the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula (dHbL)-dorsal/intermediate interpeduncular nucleus (d/iIPN) pathway, which is known to be essential for and potentiated after winning fights. Circuit potentiation is mediated by hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neuropeptides, which prolong AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) activity by increasing the expression of a flip type of alternative splicing variant of the AMPAR subunit. This mechanism may underlie how hungry vertebrates win fights and may be commonly shared across animal phylogeny."	0
"32839548"	"Cell-cell adhesion and 3D matrix confinement determine jamming transitions in breast cancer invasion.Plasticity of cancer invasion and metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells to switch between collective and single-cell dissemination, controlled by cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions. In clinical samples, E-cadherin-expressing and -deficient tumours both invade collectively and metastasize equally, implicating additional mechanisms controlling cell-cell cooperation and individualization. Here, using spatially defined organotypic culture, intravital microscopy of mammary tumours in mice and in silico modelling, we identify cell density regulation by three-dimensional tissue boundaries to physically control collective movement irrespective of the composition and stability of cell-cell junctions. Deregulation of adherens junctions by downregulation of E-cadherin and p120-catenin resulted in a transition from coordinated to uncoordinated collective movement along extracellular boundaries, whereas single-cell escape depended on locally free tissue space. These results indicate that cadherins and extracellular matrix confinement cooperate to determine unjamming transitions and stepwise epithelial fluidization towards, ultimately, cell individualization."	0
"32209474"	"Chromatin Remodeling and Immediate Early Gene Activation by SLFN11 in Response to Replication Stress.Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) was recently discovered as a cellular restriction factor against replication stress. Here, we show that SLFN11 increases chromatin accessibility genome wide, prominently at active promoters in response to replication stress induced by the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor prexasertib or the topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin. Concomitantly, SLFN11 selectively activates cellular stress response pathways by inducing the transcription of the immediate early genes (IEGs), including JUN, FOS, EGR1, NFKB2, and ATF3, together with the cell cycle arrest genes CDKN1A (p21<sup>WAF1</sup>) and GADD45. Both chromatin remodeling and IEG activation require the putative ATPase and helicase activity of SLFN11, whereas canonical extrinsic IEG activation is SLFN11 independent. SLFN11-dependent IEG activation by camptothecin is also observed across 55 non-isogenic NCI-60 cell lines. We conclude that SLFN11 acts as a global regulator of chromatin structure and an intrinsic IEG activator with the potential to engage the innate immune activation in response to replicative stress."	0

We use super-resolution microscopy to show that ≥90% of T cell receptor (TCR) complex molecules TCRαβ and TCRζ, as well as the co-receptor CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD2, reside on microvilli of resting human T cells. Furthermore, TCR proximal signaling molecules involved in the initial stages of the immune response, including the protein tyrosine kinase Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) and the key adaptor LAT (linker for activation of T cells), are also enriched on microvilli. Notably, phosphorylated proteins of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family colocalize with TCRαβ as well as with actin filaments, implying a role for one or more ERMs in linking the TCR complex to the actin cytoskeleton within microvilli. Our results establish microvilli as key signaling hubs, in which the TCR complex and its proximal signaling molecules and adaptors are preassembled prior to activation in an ERM-dependent manner, facilitating initial antigen sensing."	0
"31607545"	"Programmable Inhibition and Detection of RNA Viruses Using Cas13.The CRISPR effector Cas13 could be an effective antiviral for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses because it programmably cleaves RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here, we computationally identify thousands of potential Cas13 crRNA target sites in hundreds of ssRNA viral species that can potentially infect humans. We experimentally demonstrate Cas13's potent activity against three distinct ssRNA viruses: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV); influenza A virus (IAV); and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Combining this antiviral activity with Cas13-based diagnostics, we develop Cas13-assisted restriction of viral expression and readout (CARVER), an end-to-end platform that uses Cas13 to detect and destroy viral RNA. We further screen hundreds of crRNAs along the LCMV genome to evaluate how conservation and target RNA nucleotide content influence Cas13's antiviral activity. Our results demonstrate that Cas13 can be harnessed to target a wide range of ssRNA viruses and CARVER's potential broad utility for rapid diagnostic and antiviral drug development."	0

We describe here tagmentation-based tag integration site sequencing (TTISS), an efficient, scalable method for analyzing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that we apply in parallel to eight Cas9 variants across 59 targets. Additionally, we generated thousands of other Cas9 variants and screened for variants with enhanced specificity and activity, identifying LZ3 Cas9, a high specificity variant with a unique +1 insertion profile. This comprehensive comparison reveals a general trade-off between Cas9 activity and specificity and provides information about the frequency of generation of +1 insertions, which has implications for correcting frameshift mutations."	0
"31999955"	"ATAC-Me Captures Prolonged DNA Methylation of Dynamic Chromatin Accessibility Loci during Cell Fate Transitions.DNA methylation of enhancers is dynamic, cell-type specific, and vital for cell fate progression. However, current models inadequately define its role within the hierarchy of gene regulation. Analysis of independent datasets shows an unanticipated overlap between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at enhancers of steady-state stem cells, suggesting that these two opposing features might exist concurrently. To define their temporal relationship, we developed ATAC-Me, which probes accessibility and methylation from single DNA library preparations. We identified waves of accessibility occurring rapidly across thousands of myeloid enhancers in a monocyte-to-macrophage cell fate model. Prolonged methylation states were observed at a majority of these sites, while transcription of nearby genes tracked closely with accessibility. ATAC-Me uncovers a significant disconnect between chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation status, and gene activity. This unexpected observation highlights the value of ATAC-Me in constructing precise molecular timelines for understanding the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation."	0

"30849395"	"Mitotic CDK Promotes Replisome Disassembly, Fork Breakage, and Complex DNA Rearrangements.DNA replication errors generate complex chromosomal rearrangements and thereby contribute to tumorigenesis and other human diseases. One mechanism that triggers these errors is mitotic entry before the completion of DNA replication. To address how mitosis might affect DNA replication, we used Xenopus egg extracts. When mitotic CDK (Cyclin B1-CDK1) is used to drive interphase egg extracts into a mitotic state, the replicative CMG (CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS) helicase undergoes ubiquitylation on its MCM7 subunit, dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP. Whether replisomes have stalled or undergone termination, CMG ubiquitylation is followed by its extraction from chromatin by the CDC48/p97 ATPase. TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading during mitosis is also seen in C. elegans early embryos. At stalled forks, CMG removal results in fork breakage and end joining events involving deletions and templated insertions. Our results identify a mitotic pathway of global replisome disassembly that can trigger replication fork collapse and DNA rearrangements."	0
"31445887"	"Msp1 Clears Mistargeted Proteins by Facilitating Their Transfer from Mitochondria to the ER.Normal mitochondrial functions rely on optimized composition of their resident proteins, and proteins mistargeted to mitochondria need to be efficiently removed. Msp1, an AAA-ATPase in the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM), facilitates degradation of tail-anchored (TA) proteins mistargeted to the OM, yet how Msp1 cooperates with other factors to conduct this process was unclear. Here, we show that Msp1 recognizes substrate TA proteins and facilitates their transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Doa10 in the ER membrane then ubiquitinates them with Ubc6 and Ubc7. Ubiquitinated substrates are extracted from the ER membrane by another AAA-ATPase in the cytosol, Cdc48, with Ufd1 and Npl4 for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. Thus, Msp1 functions as an extractase that mediates clearance of mistargeted TA proteins by facilitating their transfer to the ER for protein quality control."	0

Here, we report that the Bacillus subtilis probiotic strain PXN21 inhibits α-synuclein aggregation and clears preformed aggregates in an established Caenorhabditis elegans model of synucleinopathy. This protection is seen in young and aging animals and is partly mediated by DAF-16. Multiple B. subtilis strains trigger the protective effect via both spores and vegetative cells, partly due to a biofilm formation in the gut of the worms and the release of bacterial metabolites. We identify several host metabolic pathways differentially regulated in response to probiotic exposure, including sphingolipid metabolism. We further demonstrate functional roles of the sphingolipid metabolism genes lagr-1, asm-3, and sptl-3 in the anti-aggregation effect. Our findings provide a basis for exploring the disease-modifying potential of B. subtilis as a dietary supplement."	0

Mammalian cells possess innate immunity to detect foreign circRNAs, but the molecular basis of self versus foreign identity in circRNA immunity is unknown. Here, we show that N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) RNA modification on human circRNAs inhibits innate immunity. Foreign circRNAs are potent adjuvants to induce antigen-specific T cell activation, antibody production, and anti-tumor immunity in vivo, and m<sup>6</sup>A modification abrogates immune gene activation and adjuvant activity. m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 sequesters m<sup>6</sup>A-circRNA and is essential for suppression of innate immunity. Unmodified circRNA, but not m<sup>6</sup>A-modified circRNA, directly activates RNA pattern recognition receptor RIG-I in the presence of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chain to cause filamentation of the adaptor protein MAVS and activation of the downstream transcription factor IRF3.

"32877669"	"Lactate Dehydrogenase A Governs Cardiac Hypertrophic Growth in Response to Hemodynamic Stress.The heart manifests hypertrophic growth in response to high blood pressure, which may decompensate and progress to heart failure under persistent stress. Metabolic remodeling is an early event in this process. However, its role remains to be fully characterized. Here, we show that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a critical glycolytic enzyme, is elevated in the heart in response to hemodynamic stress. Cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of LDHA leads to defective cardiac hypertrophic growth and heart failure by pressure overload. Silencing of LDHA in cultured cardiomyocytes suppresses cell growth from pro-hypertrophic stimulation in vitro, while overexpression of LDHA is sufficient to drive cardiomyocyte growth. Furthermore, we find that lactate is capable of rescuing the growth defect from LDHA knockdown. Mechanistically, lactate stabilizes NDRG3 (N-myc downregulated gene family 3) and stimulates ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Our results together suggest that the LDHA/NDRG3 axis may play a critical role in adaptive cardiomyocyte growth in response to hemodynamic stress."	0
"32503840"	"Characterization of SETD3 methyltransferase-mediated protein methionine methylation.Most characterized protein methylation events encompass arginine and lysine <i>N</i>-methylation, and only a few cases of protein methionine thiomethylation have been reported. Newly discovered oncohistone mutations include lysine-to-methionine substitutions at positions 27 and 36 of histone H3.3. In these instances, the methionine substitution localizes to the active-site pocket of the corresponding histone lysine methyltransferase, thereby inhibiting the respective transmethylation activity. SET domain-containing 3 (SETD3) is a protein (<i>i.e.</i> actin) histidine methyltransferase. Here, we generated an actin variant in which the histidine target of SETD3 was substituted with methionine. As for previously characterized histone SET domain proteins, the methionine substitution substantially (76-fold) increased binding affinity for SETD3 and inhibited SETD3 activity on histidine. Unexpectedly, SETD3 was active on the substituted methionine, generating <i>S</i>-methylmethionine in the context of actin peptide. The ternary structure of SETD3 in complex with the methionine-containing actin peptide at 1.9 Å resolution revealed that the hydrophobic thioether side chain is packed by the aromatic rings of Tyr<sup>312</sup> and Trp<sup>273</sup>, as well as the hydrocarbon side chain of Ile<sup>310</sup> Our results suggest that placing methionine properly in the active site-within close proximity to and in line with the incoming methyl group of SAM-would allow some SET domain proteins to selectively methylate methionine in proteins."	0
"32101755"	"Entropic Bristles Tune the Seeding Efficiency of Prion-Nucleating Fragments.Prions of lower eukaryotes are self-templating protein aggregates with cores formed by parallel in-register beta strands. Short aggregation-prone glutamine (Q)- and asparagine (N)-rich regions embedded in longer disordered domains have been proposed to act as nucleation sites that initiate refolding of soluble prion proteins into highly ordered fibrils, termed amyloid. We demonstrate that a short Q/N-rich peptide corresponding to a proposed nucleation site in the prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion protein Sup35 is sufficient to induce infectious cytosolic prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells ectopically expressing the soluble Sup35 NM prion domain. Embedding this nucleating core in a non-native N-rich sequence that does not form amyloid but acts as an entropic bristle quadruples seeding efficiency. Our data suggest that large disordered sequences flanking an aggregation core in prion proteins act as not only solubilizers of the monomeric protein but also breakers of the formed amyloid fibrils, enhancing infectivity of the prion seeds."	0
"32905773"	"Malic Enzyme Couples Mitochondria with Aerobic Glycolysis in Osteoblasts.The metabolic program of osteoblasts, the chief bone-making cells, remains incompletely understood. Here in murine calvarial cells, we establish that osteoblast differentiation under aerobic conditions is coupled with a marked increase in glucose consumption and lactate production but reduced oxygen consumption. As a result, aerobic glycolysis accounts for approximately 80% of the ATP production in mature osteoblasts. In vivo tracing with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose in the mouse shows that glucose in bone is readily metabolized to lactate but not organic acids in the TCA cycle. Glucose tracing in osteoblast cultures reveals that pyruvate is carboxylated to form malate integral to the malate-aspartate shuttle. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identifies Me2, encoding the mitochondrial NAD-dependent isoform of malic enzyme, as being specifically upregulated during osteoblast differentiation. Knockdown of Me2 markedly reduces the glycolytic flux and impairs osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Thus, the mitochondrial malic enzyme functionally couples the mitochondria with aerobic glycolysis in osteoblasts."	0

Here, using Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> mice and transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type Vcp/p97, we demonstrate that neurofibromin acts with VCP to control endoplasmic reticulum (ER) formation and consequent protein synthesis and regulates dendritic spine formation, thereby modulating contextual fear memory and social interaction. To validate the role of protein synthesis, we perform leucine supplementation in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that leucine can effectively enter the brain and increase protein synthesis and dendritic spine density of Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> neurons. Contextual memory and social behavior of Nf1<sup>+/-</sup> mice are also restored by leucine supplementation.

Using the multi-dendritic PVD neuron in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify CATP-8/P5A ATPase as a key regulator of dendrite branching that controls the translocation of the DMA-1 receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

"32313104"	"Overcoming Wnt-β-catenin dependent anticancer therapy resistance in leukaemia stem cells.Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) underlie cancer therapy resistance but targeting these cells remains difficult. The Wnt-β-catenin and PI3K-Akt pathways cooperate to promote tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. In a mouse model in which both pathways are activated in stem and progenitor cells, LSCs expanded under chemotherapy-induced stress. Since Akt can activate β-catenin, inhibiting this interaction might target therapy-resistant LSCs. High-throughput screening identified doxorubicin (DXR) as an inhibitor of the Akt-β-catenin interaction at low doses. Here we repurposed DXR as a targeted inhibitor rather than a broadly cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted DXR reduced Akt-activated β-catenin levels in chemoresistant LSCs and reduced LSC tumorigenic activity. Mechanistically, β-catenin binds multiple immune-checkpoint gene loci, and targeted DXR treatment inhibited expression of multiple immune checkpoints specifically in LSCs, including PD-L1, TIM3 and CD24. Overall, LSCs exhibit distinct properties of immune resistance that are reduced by inhibiting Akt-activated β-catenin. These findings suggest a strategy for overcoming cancer therapy resistance and immune escape."	0
"32726629"	"Dysregulation of the Synaptic Cytoskeleton in the PFC Drives Neural Circuit Pathology, Leading to Social Dysfunction.Psychiatric disorders are highly heritable pathologies of altered neural circuit functioning. How genetic mutations lead to specific neural circuit abnormalities underlying behavioral disruptions, however, remains unclear. Using circuit-selective transgenic tools and a mouse model of maladaptive social behavior (ArpC3 mutant), we identify a neural circuit mechanism driving dysfunctional social behavior. We demonstrate that circuit-selective knockout (ctKO) of the ArpC3 gene within prefrontal cortical neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala elevates the excitability of the circuit neurons, leading to disruption of socially evoked neural activity and resulting in abnormal social behavior. Optogenetic activation of this circuit in wild-type mice recapitulates the social dysfunction observed in ArpC3 mutant mice. Finally, the maladaptive sociability of ctKO mice is rescued by optogenetically silencing neurons within this circuit. These results highlight a mechanism of how a gene-to-neural circuit interaction drives altered social behavior, a common phenotype of several psychiatric disorders."	0
"32679077"	"Acetylation-Dependent Deubiquitinase OTUD3 Controls MAVS Activation in Innate Antiviral Immunity.Accurate regulation of innate immunity is necessary for the host to efficiently respond to invading pathogens and avoid excessive harmful immune pathology. Here we identified OTUD3 as an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinase that restricts innate antiviral immune signaling. OTUD3 deficiency in mice results in enhanced innate immunity, a diminished viral load, and morbidity. OTUD3 directly hydrolyzes lysine 63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and thus shuts off innate antiviral immune response. Notably, the catalytic activity of OTUD3 relies on acetylation of its Lys129 residue. In response to virus infection, the acetylated Lys129 is removed by SIRT1, which promptly inactivates OTUD3 and thus allows timely induction of innate antiviral immunity. Importantly, acetyl-OTUD3 levels are inversely correlated with IFN-β expression in influenza patients. These findings establish OTUD3 as a repressor of MAVS and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the catalytic activity of OTUD3 is tightly controlled to ensure timely activation of antiviral defense."	1
"32187557"	"Quantitative Analysis of 3D Tissue Deformation Reveals Key Cellular Mechanism Associated with Initial Heart Looping.Despite extensive study, the morphogenetic mechanisms of heart looping remain controversial because of a lack of information concerning precise tissue-level deformation and the quantitative relationship between tissue and cellular dynamics; this lack of information causes difficulties in evaluating previously proposed models. To overcome these limitations, we perform four-dimensional (4D) high-resolution imaging to reconstruct a tissue deformation map, which reveals that, at the tissue scale, initial heart looping is achieved by left-right (LR) asymmetry in the direction of deformation within the myocardial tube. We further identify F-actin-dependent directional cell rearrangement in the right myocardium as a major contributor to LR asymmetric tissue deformation. Our findings demonstrate that heart looping involves dynamic and intrinsic cellular behaviors within the tubular tissue and provide a significantly different viewpoint from current models that are based on LR asymmetry of growth and/or stress at the tube boundaries. Finally, we propose a minimally sufficient model for initial heart looping that is also supported by mechanical simulations."	0

Abrogation of this interaction increased phosphotransferase activity, promoted membrane association, and provoked phosphotransferase-independent alterations in cell morphology. Thus, Src's SH4 domain serves as an intramolecular regulator coupling catalytic activity, global conformation, and localization, as well as mediating a phosphotransferase-independent function. Sequence conservation suggests that the SH4 domain regulatory interaction exists in other Src-family kinases. Our combined approach's ability to reveal a regulatory mechanism in one of the best-studied kinases suggests that it could be applied broadly to provide insight into kinase structure, regulation, and function."	0
"32579922"	"Sex Differences in Gene Expression and Regulatory Networks across 29 Human Tissues.Sex differences manifest in many diseases and may drive sex-specific therapeutic responses. To understand the molecular basis of sex differences, we evaluated sex-biased gene regulation by constructing sample-specific gene regulatory networks in 29 human healthy tissues using 8,279 whole-genome expression profiles from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We find sex-biased regulatory network structures in each tissue. Even though most transcription factors (TFs) are not differentially expressed between males and females, many have sex-biased regulatory targeting patterns. In each tissue, genes that are differentially targeted by TFs between the sexes are enriched for tissue-related functions and diseases. In brain tissue, for example, genes associated with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are targeted by different sets of TFs in each sex. Our systems-based analysis identifies a repertoire of TFs that play important roles in sex-specific architecture of gene regulatory networks, and it underlines sex-specific regulatory processes in both health and disease."	0

Mutated RAS proteins trigger antiapoptotic and cell-proliferative signals and lead to oncogenesis. However, RAS also induces apoptosis and senescence, which may contribute to the eradication of cells with RAS mutations. We previously reported that Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6) binds MDM2 and stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and that the active form of KRAS promotes the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2. We also reported that Unc-119 lipid-binding chaperone (UNC119A), a chaperone of myristoylated proteins, interacts with RASSF6 and regulates RASSF6-mediated apoptosis. In this study, using several human cancer cell lines, quantitative RT-PCR, RNAi-based gene silencing, and immunoprecipitation/-fluorescence and cell biology assays, we report that UNC119A interacts with the active form of KRAS and that the C-terminal modification of KRAS is required for this interaction. We also noted that the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119A, which binds the myristoylated peptides, is not involved in the interaction. We observed that UNC119A promotes the binding of KRAS to RASSF6, enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2, and induces apoptosis. Conversely, <i>UNC119A</i> silencing promoted soft-agar colony formation, migration, and invasiveness in KRAS-mutated cancer cells. We conclude that UNC119A promotes KRAS-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis via RASSF6 and may play a tumor-suppressive role in cells with KRAS mutations."	1
"32471866"	"Engineered anti-inflammatory peptides inspired by mapping an evasin-chemokine interaction.Chemokines mediate leukocyte migration and homeostasis and are key targets in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, cytokine storm, and chronic autoimmune disease. Chemokine redundancy and ensuing network robustness has frustrated therapeutic development. Salivary evasins from ticks bind multiple chemokines to overcome redundancy and are effective in several preclinical disease models. Their clinical development has not progressed because of concerns regarding potential immunogenicity, parenteral delivery, and cost. Peptides mimicking protein activity can overcome the perceived limitations of therapeutic proteins. Here we show that peptides possessing multiple chemokine-binding and anti-inflammatory activities can be developed from the chemokine-binding site of an evasin. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS to map the binding interface of the evasin P672 that physically interacts with C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 8 and synthesized a 16-mer peptide (BK1.1) based on this interface region in evasin P672. Fluorescent polarization and native MS approaches showed that BK1.1 binds CCL8, CCL7, and CCL18 and disrupts CCL8 homodimerization. We show that a BK1.1 derivative, BK1.3, has substantially improved ability to disrupt P672 binding to CCL8, CCL2, and CCL3 in an AlphaScreen assay. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that BK1.3 directly binds CCL8. BK1.3 also has substantially improved ability to inhibit CCL8, CCL7, CCL2, and CCL3 chemotactic function <i>in vitro</i> We show that local as well as systemic administration of BK1.3 potently blocks inflammation <i>in vivo</i> Identification and characterization of the chemokine-binding interface of evasins could thus inspire the development of novel anti-inflammatory peptides that therapeutically target the chemokine network in inflammatory diseases."	0
"32492433"	"Acute Myeloid Leukemia iPSCs Reveal a Role for RUNX1 in the Maintenance of Human Leukemia Stem Cells.Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are believed to have more distinct vulnerabilities than the bulk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, but their rarity and the lack of universal markers for their prospective isolation hamper their study. We report that genetically clonal induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an AML patient and characterized by exceptionally high engraftment potential give rise, upon hematopoietic differentiation, to a phenotypic hierarchy. Through fate-tracking experiments, xenotransplantation, and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify a cell fraction (iLSC) that can be isolated prospectively by means of adherent in vitro growth that resides on the apex of this hierarchy and fulfills the hallmark features of LSCs. Through integrative genomic studies of the iLSC transcriptome and chromatin landscape, we derive an LSC gene signature that predicts patient survival and uncovers a dependency of LSCs, across AML genotypes, on the RUNX1 transcription factor. These findings can empower efforts to therapeutically target AML LSCs."	0

In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading complicates the identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. A within-person differential loading and analysis strategy reduces heterogeneity for changes in muscle mass by ∼40% and uses a genome-wide transcriptome method that models each mRNA from coding exons and 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Our strategy detects ∼3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation undetected by other methods. We discover a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth, which we validate from newly analyzed independent samples (n = 100). Further validating these identified genes via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis. Using proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis reveals notable relationships with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity, as well as potential drug therapies."	0
"32636304"	"The barley lectin, horcolin, binds high-mannose glycans in a multivalent fashion, enabling high-affinity, specific inhibition of cellular HIV infection.<i>N</i>-Linked glycans are critical to the infection cycle of HIV, and most neutralizing antibodies target the high-mannose glycans found on the surface envelope glycoprotein-120 (gp120). Carbohydrate-binding proteins, particularly mannose-binding lectins, have also been shown to bind these glycans. Despite their therapeutic potency, their ability to cause lymphocyte proliferation limits their application. In this study, we report one such lectin named horcolin (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> lectin), seen to lack mitogenicity owing to the divergence in the residues at its carbohydrate-binding sites, which makes it a promising candidate for exploration as an anti-HIV agent. Extensive isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that the lectin was sensitive to the length and branching of mannooligosaccharides and thereby the total valency. Modeling and simulation studies demonstrate two distinct modes of binding, a monovalent binding to shorter saccharides and a bivalent mode for higher glycans, involving simultaneous interactions of multiple glycan arms with the primary carbohydrate-binding sites. This multivalent mode of binding was further strengthened by interactions of core mannosyl residues with a secondary conserved site on the protein, leading to an exponential increase in affinity. Finally, we confirmed the interaction of horcolin with recombinant gp120 and gp140 with high affinity and inhibition of HIV infection at nanomolar concentrations without mitogenicity."	0
"32611613"	"RNA polymerase III transcription as a disease factor.RNA polymerase (Pol) III is responsible for transcription of different noncoding genes in eukaryotic cells, whose RNA products have well-defined functions in translation and other biological processes for some, and functions that remain to be defined for others. For all of them, however, new functions are being described. For example, Pol III products have been reported to regulate certain proteins such as protein kinase R (PKR) by direct association, to constitute the source of very short RNAs with regulatory roles in gene expression, or to control microRNA levels by sequestration. Consistent with these many functions, deregulation of Pol III transcribed genes is associated with a large variety of human disorders. Here we review different human diseases that have been linked to defects in the Pol III transcription apparatus or to Pol III products imbalance and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms."	0

"31101499"	"Targeted and Persistent 8-Oxoguanine Base Damage at Telomeres Promotes Telomere Loss and Crisis.Telomeres are essential for genome stability. Oxidative stress caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accelerates telomere shortening. Although telomeres are hypersensitive to ROS-mediated 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation, the biological effect of this common lesion at telomeres is poorly understood because ROS have pleiotropic effects. Here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that selectively produces 8-oxoG only at telomeres. Acute telomeric 8-oxoG formation increased telomere fragility in cells lacking OGG1, the enzyme that removes 8-oxoG, but did not compromise cell survival. However, chronic telomeric 8-oxoG induction over time shortens telomeres and impairs cell growth. Accumulation of telomeric 8-oxoG in chronically exposed OGG1-deficient cells triggers replication stress, as evidenced by mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, and significantly increases telomere losses. These losses generate chromosome fusions, leading to chromatin bridges and micronucleus formation upon cell division. By confining base damage to the telomeres, we show that telomeric 8-oxoG accumulation directly drives telomere crisis."	0
"32348767"	"Mechanism of Virus Attenuation by Codon Pair Deoptimization.Codon pair deoptimization is an efficient virus attenuation strategy, but the mechanism that leads to attenuation is unknown. The strategy involves synthetic recoding of viral genomes that alters the positions of synonymous codons, thereby increasing the number of suboptimal codon pairs and CpG dinucleotides in recoded genomes. Here we identify the molecular mechanism of codon pair deoptimization-based attenuation by studying recoded influenza A viruses. We show that suboptimal codon pairs cause attenuation, whereas the increase of CpG dinucleotides has no effect. Furthermore, we show that suboptimal codon pairs reduce both mRNA stability and translation efficiency of codon pair-deoptimized genes. Consequently, reduced protein production directly causes virus attenuation. Our study provides evidence that suboptimal codon pairs are major determinants of mRNA stability. Additionally, it demonstrates that codon pair bias can be used to increase mRNA stability and protein production of synthetic genes in many areas of biotechnology."	0
"32464093"	"Insulin- and Lipopolysaccharide-Mediated Signaling in Adipose Tissue Macrophages Regulates Postprandial Glycemia through Akt-mTOR Activation.The physiological role of immune cells in the regulation of postprandial glucose metabolism has not been fully elucidated. We have found that adipose tissue macrophages produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) upon feeding, which suppresses hepatic glucose production in cooperation with insulin. Both elevated insulin and gut-microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide in response to feeding are required for IL-10 production via the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Indeed, myeloid-specific knockout of the insulin receptor or bone marrow transplantation of mutant TLR4 marrow cells results in increased expression of gluconeogenic genes and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, myeloid-specific Akt1 and Akt2 knockout results in similar phenotypes that are rescued by additional knockout of TSC2, an inhibitor of mTOR. In obesity, IL-10 production is impaired due to insulin resistance in macrophages, whereas adenovirus-mediated expression of IL-10 ameliorates postprandial hyperglycemia. Thus, the orchestrated response of the endogenous hormone and gut environment to feeding is a key regulator of postprandial glycemia."	0
"32187550"	"miR-181a Modulation of ERK-MAPK Signaling Sustains DC-SIGN Expression and Limits Activation of Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells.DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) play important roles in bacterial infections and inflammatory diseases, but the factors regulating their differentiation and proinflammatory status remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a microRNA, miR-181a, and a molecular mechanism that simultaneously regulate the acquisition of DC-SIGN expression and the activation state of DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> mo-DCs. Specifically, we show that miR-181a promotes DC-SIGN expression during terminal mo-DC differentiation and limits its sensitivity and responsiveness to TLR triggering and CD40 ligation. Mechanistically, miR-181a sustains ERK-MAPK signaling in mo-DCs, thereby enabling the maintenance of high levels of DC-SIGN and a high activation threshold. Low miR-181a levels during mo-DC differentiation, induced by inflammatory signals, do not support the high phospho-ERK signal transduction required for DC-SIGN<sup>hi</sup> mo-DCs and lead to development of proinflammatory DC-SIGN<sup>lo/-</sup> mo-DCs. Collectively, our study demonstrates that high DC-SIGN expression levels and a high activation threshold in mo-DCs are linked and simultaneously maintained by miR-181a."	1
"32592681"	"Robust Hi-C Maps of Enhancer-Promoter Interactions Reveal the Function of Non-coding Genome in Neural Development and Diseases.Genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions at high resolution remains experimentally and computationally challenging. Here we used a low-input ""easy Hi-C"" protocol to map the 3D genome architecture in human neurogenesis and brain tissues and also demonstrated that a rigorous Hi-C bias-correction pipeline (HiCorr) can significantly improve the sensitivity and robustness of Hi-C loop identification at sub-TAD level, especially the enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. We used HiCorr to compare the high-resolution maps of chromatin interactions from 10 tissue or cell types with a focus on neurogenesis and brain tissues. We found that dynamic chromatin loops are better hallmarks for cellular differentiation than compartment switching. HiCorr allowed direct observation of cell-type- and differentiation-specific E-P aggregates spanning large neighborhoods, suggesting a mechanism that stabilizes enhancer contacts during development. Interestingly, we concluded that Hi-C loop outperforms eQTL in explaining neurological GWAS results, revealing a unique value of high-resolution 3D genome maps in elucidating the disease etiology."	0
"30745087"	"Deciphering the Molecular Mechanism Underpinning Phage Arbitrium Communication Systems.Bacillus phages use a communication system, termed ""arbitrium,"" to coordinate lysis-lysogeny decisions. Arbitrium communication is mediated by the production and secretion of a hexapeptide (AimP) during lytic cycle. Once internalized, AimP reduces the expression of the negative regulator of lysogeny, AimX, by binding to the transcription factor, AimR, promoting lysogeny. We have elucidated the crystal structures of AimR from the Bacillus subtilis SPbeta phage in its apo form, bound to its DNA operator and in complex with AimP. AimR presents intrinsic plasticity, sharing structural features with the RRNPP quorum-sensing family. Remarkably, AimR binds to an unusual operator with a long spacer that interacts nonspecifically with the receptor TPR domain, while the HTH domain canonically recognizes two inverted repeats. AimP stabilizes a compact conformation of AimR that approximates the DNA-recognition helices, preventing AimR binding to the aimX promoter region. Our results establish the molecular basis of the arbitrium communication system."	0
"32531202"	"Tuning Transcription Factor Availability through Acetylation-Mediated Genomic Redistribution.It is widely assumed that decreasing transcription factor DNA-binding affinity reduces transcription initiation by diminishing occupancy of sequence-specific regulatory elements. However, in vivo transcription factors find their binding sites while confronted with a large excess of low-affinity degenerate motifs. Here, using the melanoma lineage survival oncogene MITF as a model, we show that low-affinity binding sites act as a competitive reservoir in vivo from which transcription factors are released by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-stimulated acetylation to promote increased occupancy of their regulatory elements. Consequently, a low-DNA-binding-affinity acetylation-mimetic MITF mutation supports melanocyte development and drives tumorigenesis, whereas a high-affinity non-acetylatable mutant does not. The results reveal a paradoxical acetylation-mediated molecular clutch that tunes transcription factor availability via genome-wide redistribution and couples BRAF to tumorigenesis. Our results further suggest that p300/CREB-binding protein-mediated transcription factor acetylation may represent a common mechanism to control transcription factor availability."	0
"32647010"	"Simplified detection of polyhistidine-tagged proteins in gels and membranes using a UV-excitable dye and a multiple chelator head pair.The polyhistidine tag (His-tag) is one of the most popular protein tags used in the life sciences. Traditionally, the detection of His-tagged proteins relies on immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies. This approach is laborious for certain applications, such as protein purification, where time and simplicity are critical. The His-tag can also be directly detected by metal ion-loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based chelator heads conjugated to fluorophores, which is a convenient alternative method to immunoblotting. Typically, such chelator heads are conjugated to either green or red fluorophores, the detection of which requires specialized excitation sources and detection systems. Here, we demonstrate that post-run staining is ideal for His-tag detection by metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads in PAGE and blot membranes. Additionally, by comparing the performances of different chelator heads, we show how differences in microscopic affinity constants translate to macroscopic differences in the detection limits in environments with limited diffusion, such as PAGE. On the basis of these results, we devise a simple approach, called UVHis-PAGE, that uses metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads to detect His-tagged proteins in PAGE and blot membranes. Our method uses a UV transilluminator as an excitation source, and the results can be visually inspected by the naked eye."	0
"31995747"	"Human pDCs Are Superior to cDC2s in Attracting Cytolytic Lymphocytes in Melanoma Patients Receiving DC Vaccination.Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) are currently under evaluation for use in cancer vaccines. Although both DC subsets can activate adaptive and innate lymphocytes, their capacity to recruit such cells is rarely considered. Here, we show that pDCs and cDC2s display a striking difference in chemokine secretion, which correlates with the recruitment of distinct types of immune effector cells. Activated pDCs express high levels of CXCR3 ligands and attract more CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD56<sup>+</sup> T cells, and γδ T cells in vitro, compared to cDC2s. Skin from melanoma patients shows an influx of immune effector cells following intradermal vaccination with pDCs or cDC2s, with pDCs inducing the strongest influx of lymphocytes known to possess cytolytic activity. These findings suggest that combining both DC subsets could unite the preferred chemoattractive properties of pDCs with the superior T cell priming properties of cDC2s to ultimately enhance vaccine efficacy."	0

"31879358"	"TRPS1 acts as a context-dependent regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth/differentiation and breast cancer development.The GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor TRPS1 has been implicated in breast cancer. However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications and inactivating mutations in <i>TRPS1</i> have been reported. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary gland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by functional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary epithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling promotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 expression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo survival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, the consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined inactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary organoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results demonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal mammary epithelial cells."	0
"30737186"	"Dynamic Processing of Displacement Loops during Recombinational DNA Repair.Displacement loops (D-loops) are pivotal intermediates of homologous recombination (HR), a universal DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathway.

Nascent D-loops are detected within 2 h of DSB formation and extended in a delayed fashion in a genetic system designed to preclude downstream repair steps. The majority of nascent D-loops are disrupted by two pathways: one supported by the Srs2 helicase and the other by the Mph1 helicase and the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 helicase-topoisomerase complex. Both pathways operate without significant overlap and are delineated by the Rad54 paralog Rdh54 in an ATPase-independent fashion.

"32521267"	"Stem Cell Determinant SOX9 Promotes Lineage Plasticity and Progression in Basal-like Breast Cancer.Lineage plasticity is important for the development of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), an aggressive cancer subtype. While BLBC is likely to originate from luminal progenitor cells, it acquires substantial basal cell features and contains a heterogenous collection of cells exhibiting basal, luminal, and hybrid phenotypes. Why luminal progenitors are prone to BLBC transformation and what drives luminal-to-basal reprogramming remain unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor SOX9 acts as a determinant for estrogen-receptor-negative (ER<sup>-</sup>) luminal stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs). SOX9 controls LSPC activity in part by activating both canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Inactivation of TP53 and RB via expression of SV40 TAg in a BLBC mouse tumor model leads to upregulation of SOX9, which drives luminal-to-basal reprogramming in vivo. Furthermore, SOX9 deletion inhibits the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-like lesions to invasive carcinoma. These data show that ER<sup>-</sup> LSPC determinant SOX9 acts as a lineage plasticity driver for BLBC progression."	0
"31444107"	"Proteomics Links Ubiquitin Chain Topology Change to Transcription Factor Activation.A surprising complexity of ubiquitin signaling has emerged with identification of different ubiquitin chain topologies. However, mechanisms of how the diverse ubiquitin codes control biological processes remain poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative whole-proteome mass spectrometry to identify yeast proteins that are regulated by lysine 11 (K11)-linked ubiquitin chains. The entire Met4 pathway, which links cell proliferation with sulfur amino acid metabolism, was significantly affected by K11 chains and selected for mechanistic studies. Previously, we demonstrated that a K48-linked ubiquitin chain represses the transcription factor Met4. Here, we show that efficient Met4 activation requires a K11-linked topology. Mechanistically, our results propose that the K48 chain binds to a topology-selective tandem ubiquitin binding region in Met4 and competes with binding of the basal transcription machinery to the same region. The change to K11-enriched chain architecture releases this competition and permits binding of the basal transcription complex to activate transcription."	0

However, the precise sets of proteins regulated by the key translational stress responses-the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTORC1-remain elusive. We developed multiplexed enhanced protein dynamics (mePROD) proteomics, adding signal amplification to dynamic-SILAC and multiplexing, to enable measuring acute changes in protein synthesis. Treating cells with ISR/mTORC1-modulating stressors, we showed extensive translatome modulation with ∼20% of proteins synthesized at highly reduced rates. Comparing translation-deficient sub-proteomes revealed an extensive overlap demonstrating that target specificity is achieved on protein level and not by pathway activation. Titrating cap-dependent translation inhibition confirmed that synthesis of individual proteins is controlled by intrinsic properties responding to global translation attenuation. This study reports a highly sensitive method to measure relative translation at the nascent chain level and provides insight into how the ISR and mTORC1, two key cellular pathways, regulate the translatome to guide cellular survival upon stress."	0

However, it is incompletely understood how luminal signals are integrated to control the development of L cells. Here we show that food availability and gut microbiota-produced short-chain fatty acids control the posttranslational modification on intracellular proteins by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in intestinal epithelial cells. Via FOXO1 O-GlcNAcylation, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) suppresses expression of the lineage-specifying transcription factor Neurogenin 3 and, thus, L cell differentiation from enteroendocrine progenitors. Intestinal epithelial ablation of OGT in mice not only causes L cell hyperplasia and increased secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but also disrupts gut microbial compositions, which notably contributes to decreased weight gain and improved glycemic control. Our results identify intestinal epithelial O-GlcNAc signaling as a brake on L cell development and function in response to nutritional and microbial cues."	0

H3K9me2 and 3-marked nucleosomal arrays and associated complexes undergo phase separation to form macromolecule-enriched liquid droplets. The droplets are reminiscent of heterochromatin as they are highly dense chromatin-containing structures that are resistant to DNase and exclude the general transcription factor TFIIB.

Combination therapies involving metabolic inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), chemotherapy, radiation, and/or diet now offer new approaches for cancer therapy. However, it remains uncertain how to best utilize these strategies in the context of the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Oncogene-driven changes in tumor cell metabolism can impact the TME to limit immune responses and present barriers to cancer therapy. These changes also reveal opportunities to reshape the TME by targeting metabolic pathways to favor immunity. Here we explore current strategies that shift immune cell metabolism to pro-inflammatory states in the TME and highlight a need to better replicate physiologic conditions to select targets, clarify mechanisms, and optimize metabolic inhibitors.

Most repair pathways involve single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), making replication protein A (RPA) a hallmark of DNA damage and replication stress. RPA foci emerging during S phase in response to tolerable loads of polymerase-blocking lesions are generally thought to indicate stalled replication intermediates. We now report that in budding yeast they predominantly form far away from sites of ongoing replication, and they do not overlap with any of the repair centers associated with collapsed replication forks or double-strand breaks. Instead, they represent sites of postreplicative DNA damage bypass involving translesion synthesis and homologous recombination. We propose that most RPA and recombination foci induced by polymerase-blocking lesions in the replication template are clusters of repair tracts arising from replication centers by polymerase re-priming and subsequent expansion of daughter-strand gaps over the course of S phase."	0

Although some of these genes are controlled by specific transcriptional programs, very little is known about their post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we analyze the expression signature associated with all 687 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and identify 39 that significantly correlate with cell cycle mRNAs. We find that NF45 and NF90 play essential roles in mitosis, and transcriptome analysis reveals that they are necessary for the expression of a subset of mitotic mRNAs. Using proteomics, we identify protein clusters associated with the NF45-NF90 complex, including components of Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). We show that depletion of SMD components increases the binding of mitotic mRNAs to the NF45-NF90 complex and rescues cells from mitotic defects.

"31300274"	"Nuclear TARBP2 Drives Oncogenic Dysregulation of RNA Splicing and Decay.Post-transcriptional regulation of RNA stability is a key step in gene expression control. We describe a regulatory program, mediated by the RNA binding protein TARBP2, that controls RNA stability in the nucleus. TARBP2 binding to pre-mRNAs results in increased intron retention, subsequently leading to targeted degradation of TARBP2-bound transcripts. This is mediated by TARBP2 recruitment of the m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation machinery to its target transcripts, where deposition of m<sup>6</sup>A marks influences the recruitment of splicing regulators, inhibiting efficient splicing. Interactions between TARBP2 and the nucleoprotein TPR then promote degradation of these TARBP2-bound transcripts by the nuclear exosome. Additionally, analysis of clinical gene expression datasets revealed a functional role for TARBP2 in lung cancer. Using xenograft mouse models, we find that TARBP2 affects tumor growth in the lung and that this is dependent on TARBP2-mediated destabilization of ABCA3 and FOXN3. Finally, we establish ZNF143 as an upstream regulator of TARBP2 expression."	0

The anti-recombinogenic functions of 53BP1 require phosphorylation-dependent interactions with PTIP and RIF1/shieldin effector complexes. While RIF1/shieldin blocks 5'-3' nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, it remains unclear how PTIP antagonizes HR. Here, we show that mutation of the PTIP interaction site in 53BP1 (S25A) allows sufficient DNA2-dependent end resection to rescue the lethality of BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup> mice, despite increasing RIF1 ""end-blocking"" at DNA damage sites. However, double-mutant cells fail to complete HR, as excessive shieldin activity also inhibits RNF168-mediated loading of PALB2/RAD51. As a result, BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup>53BP1<sup>S25A</sup> mice exhibit hallmark features of HR insufficiency, including premature aging and hypersensitivity to PARPi. Disruption of shieldin or forced targeting of PALB2 to ssDNA in BRCA1<sup>D11</sup>53BP1<sup>S25A</sup> cells restores RNF168 recruitment, RAD51 nucleofilament formation, and PARPi resistance.

Early in development, aRG express high levels of Foxp1 mRNA and protein, which promote self-renewing cell divisions and deep-layer neuron production. Foxp1 levels subsequently decline during the transition to superficial-layer neurogenesis. Sustained Foxp1 expression impedes this transition, preserving a population of cells with aRG identity throughout development and extending the early neurogenic period into postnatal life. FOXP1 expression is further associated with the initial formation and expansion of basal RG (bRG) during human corticogenesis and can promote the formation of cells exhibiting characteristics of bRG when misexpressed in the mouse cortex. Together, these findings reveal broad functions for Foxp1 in cortical neurogenesis."	0
"32402283"	"A Biomarker for Predicting Responsiveness to Stem Cell Therapy Based on Mechanism-of-Action: Evidence from Cerebral Injury.To date, no stem cell therapy has been directed to specific recipients-and, conversely, withheld from others-based on a clinical or molecular profile congruent with that cell's therapeutic mechanism-of-action (MOA) for that condition. We address this challenge preclinically with a prototypical scenario: human neural stem cells (hNSCs) against perinatal/neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII). We demonstrate that a clinically translatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) algorithm, hierarchical region splitting, provides a rigorous, expeditious, prospective, noninvasive ""biomarker"" for identifying subjects with lesions bearing a molecular profile indicative of responsiveness to hNSCs' neuroprotective MOA. Implanted hNSCs improve lesional, motor, and/or cognitive outcomes only when there is an MRI-measurable penumbra that can be forestalled from evolving into necrotic core; the core never improves. Unlike the core, a penumbra is characterized by a molecular profile associated with salvageability. Hence, only lesions characterized by penumbral > core volumes should be treated with cells, making such measurements arguably a regenerative medicine selection biomarker."	0
"32402273"	"SAMHD1 Limits the Efficacy of Forodesine in Leukemia by Protecting Cells against the Cytotoxicity of dGTP.The anti-leukemia agent forodesine causes cytotoxic overload of intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) but is efficacious only in a subset of patients. We report that SAMHD1, a phosphohydrolase degrading deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), protects cells against the effects of dNTP imbalances. SAMHD1-deficient cells induce intrinsic apoptosis upon provision of deoxyribonucleosides, particularly deoxyguanosine (dG). Moreover, dG and forodesine act synergistically to kill cells lacking SAMHD1. Using mass cytometry, we find that these compounds kill SAMHD1-deficient malignant cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Normal cells and CLL cells from patients without SAMHD1 mutation are unaffected. We therefore propose to use forodesine as a precision medicine for leukemia, stratifying patients by SAMHD1 genotype or expression."	0

ATRX is known to maintain genomic stability in neuroprogenitor cells, but its function in differentiated neurons and memory processes remains largely unresolved. Here, we show that the deletion of neuronal Atrx in mice leads to distinct hippocampal structural defects, fewer presynaptic vesicles, and an enlarged postsynaptic area at CA1 apical dendrite-axon junctions. We identify male-specific impairments in long-term contextual memory and in synaptic gene expression, linked to altered miR-137 levels. We show that ATRX directly binds to the miR-137 locus and that the enrichment of the suppressive histone mark H3K27me3 is significantly reduced upon the loss of ATRX. We conclude that the ablation of ATRX in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to sexually dimorphic effects on miR-137 expression and on spatial memory, identifying a potential therapeutic target for neurological defects caused by ATRX dysfunction."	1

Single-cell genomic techniques have emerged as powerful approaches to dissect human tumors at the resolution of individual cells, providing a compelling approach to deciphering cancer biology.

"32375053"	"Suppression of Inflammasome Activation by IRF8 and IRF4 in cDCs Is Critical for T Cell Priming.Inflammasome activation leads to pyroptotic cell death, thereby eliminating the replicative niche of virulent pathogens. Although inflammasome-associated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 have an established role in T cell function, whether inflammasome activation in dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for T cell priming is not clear. Here, we find that conventional DCs (cDCs) suppress inflammasome activation to prevent pyroptotic cell death, thus preserving their ability to prime both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Transcription factors IRF8 and IRF4, in cDC1s and cDC2s, respectively, mediate suppression of inflammasome activation by limiting the expression of inflammasome-associated genes. Overexpression of IRF4 or IRF8 inhibits inflammasome activation in macrophages, while reduced expression of IRF8 leads to aberrant inflammasome activation in cDC1s and hampers their ability to prime CD8 T cells. Thus, activation of inflammasome in DCs is detrimental to adaptive immunity, and our results reveal that cDCs use IRF4 and IRF8 to suppress this response."	0

However, the molecular determinants controlling KAR postsynaptic localization and stabilization are poorly understood. Here, we exploit optogenetic and single-particle tracking approaches to study the role of KAR conformational states induced by glutamate binding on KAR lateral mobility at synapses. We report that following glutamate binding, KARs are readily and reversibly trapped at glutamatergic synapses through increased interaction with the β-catenin/N-cadherin complex. We demonstrate that such activation-dependent synaptic immobilization of KARs is crucial for the modulation of short-term plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Thus, the present study unveils the crosstalk between conformational states and lateral mobility of KARs, a mechanism regulating glutamatergic signaling, particularly in conditions of sustained synaptic activity."	0
"32611768"	"Direct evidence for a new mode of plant defense against insects via a novel polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein expression strategy.Plant cell wall-associated polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. They play a crucial role in plant defense against phytopathogens by inhibiting microbial polygalacturonases (PGs). PGs hydrolyze the cell wall polysaccharide pectin and are among the first enzymes to be secreted during plant infection. Recent studies demonstrated that herbivorous insects express their own PG multi-gene families, raising the question whether PGIPs also inhibit insect PGs and protect plants from herbivores. Preliminary evidence suggested that PGIPs may negatively influence larval growth of the leaf beetle <i>Phaedon cochleariae</i> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and identified BrPGIP3 from Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinensis</i>) as a candidate. PGIPs are predominantly studied <i>in planta</i> because their heterologous expression in microbial systems is problematic and instability and aggregation of recombinant PGIPs has complicated <i>in vitro</i> inhibition assays. To minimize aggregate formation, we heterologously expressed BrPGIP3 fused to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor, immobilizing it on the extracellular surface of insect cells. We demonstrated that BrPGIP3_GPI inhibited several <i>P. cochleariae</i> PGs <i>in vitro</i>, providing the first direct evidence of an interaction between a plant PGIP and an animal PG. Thus, plant PGIPs not only confer resistance against phytopathogens, but may also aid in defense against herbivorous beetles."	0
"32499403"	"Dynamic regulation of histone modifications and long-range chromosomal interactions during postmitotic transcriptional reactivation.During mitosis, transcription of genomic DNA is dramatically reduced, before it is reactivated during nuclear reformation in anaphase/telophase. Many aspects of the underlying principles that mediate transcriptional memory and reactivation in the daughter cells remain unclear. Here, we used ChIP-seq on synchronized cells at different stages after mitosis to generate genome-wide maps of histone modifications. Combined with EU-RNA-seq and Hi-C analyses, we found that during prometaphase, promoters, enhancers, and insulators retain H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, while losing H3K27ac. Enhancers globally retaining mitotic H3K4me1 or locally retaining mitotic H3K27ac are associated with cell type-specific genes and their transcription factors for rapid transcriptional activation. As cells exit mitosis, promoters regain H3K27ac, which correlates with transcriptional reactivation. Insulators also gain H3K27ac and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in anaphase/telophase. This increase of H3K27ac in anaphase/telophase is required for posttranscriptional activation and may play a role in the establishment of topologically associating domains (TADs). Together, our results suggest that the genome is reorganized in a sequential order, in which histone methylations occur first in prometaphase, histone acetylation, and CTCF in anaphase/telophase, transcription in cytokinesis, and long-range chromatin interactions in early G1. We thus provide insights into the histone modification landscape that allows faithful reestablishment of the transcriptional program and TADs during cell division."	0
"30797687"	"Physical Basis for the Loading of a Bacterial Replicative Helicase onto DNA.In cells, dedicated AAA+ ATPases deposit hexameric, ring-shaped helicases onto DNA to initiate chromosomal replication. To better understand the mechanisms by which helicase loading can occur, we used cryo-EM to determine sub-4-Å-resolution structures of the E. coli DnaB⋅DnaC helicase⋅loader complex with nucleotide in pre- and post-DNA engagement states. In the absence of DNA, six DnaC protomers latch onto and crack open a DnaB hexamer using an extended N-terminal domain, stabilizing this conformation through nucleotide-dependent ATPase interactions. Upon binding DNA, DnaC hydrolyzes ATP, allowing DnaB to isomerize into a topologically closed, pre-translocation state competent to bind primase. Our data show how DnaC opens the DnaB ring and represses the helicase prior to DNA binding and how DnaC ATPase activity is reciprocally regulated by DnaB and DNA. Comparative analyses reveal how the helicase loading mechanism of DnaC parallels and diverges from homologous AAA+ systems involved in DNA replication and transposition."	0
"32460017"	"Pyruvate Kinase M2 Promotes the Activation of Dendritic Cells by Enhancing IL-12p35 Expression.Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging evidence has demonstrated metabolic reprogramming during DC activation. However, how DC activation is linked with metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here we show that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the last step of glycolysis, is critical for LPS-induced DC activation. Upon DC activation, JNK signaling stimulated p300 association with PKM2 for the acetylation of lysine 433, a classic posttranslational modification critical for PKM2 destabilization and nuclear re-localization. Subsequently, nuclear PKM2 partnered with c-Rel to enhance Il12p35 expression, which is important for Th1 cell differentiation. Meanwhile, decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 due to detetramerization facilitated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, helping DCs meet their need for biomacromolecules. Together, we provide evidence for metabolic control of DC activation and offer insights into aberrant immune responses due to dysregulated Th1 functions."	1
"32726630"	"Neutrophil Caspase-11 Is Essential to Defend against a Cytosol-Invasive Bacterium.Either caspase-1 or caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D to cause pyroptosis, eliminating intracellular replication niches. We previously showed that macrophages detect Burkholderia thailandensis via NLRC4, triggering the release of interleukin (IL)-18 and driving an essential interferon (IFN)-γ response that primes caspase-11. We now identify the IFN-γ-producing cells as a mixture of natural killer (NK) and T cells. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D in macrophages and neutrophils, we find that NLRC4-activated caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis in macrophages, but this pathway does not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils. In contrast, caspase-11 triggers pyroptosis in both macrophages and neutrophils. This translates to an absolute requirement for caspase-11 in neutrophils during B. thailandensis infection in mice. We present an example of inflammasome sensors causing diverging outcomes in different cell types. Thus, cell fates are dictated not simply by the pathogen or inflammasome, but also by how the cell is wired to respond to detection events."	0
"32755595"	"A Structure-Based Mechanism for DNA Entry into the Cohesin Ring.Despite key roles in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome organization, the mechanism by which cohesin rings are loaded onto DNA is still unknown. Here we combine biochemical approaches and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize a cohesin loading intermediate in which DNA is locked between two gates that lead into the cohesin ring. Building on this structural framework, we design experiments to establish the order of events during cohesin loading. In an initial step, DNA traverses an N-terminal kleisin gate that is first opened upon ATP binding and then closed as the cohesin loader locks the DNA against the ATPase gate. ATP hydrolysis will lead to ATPase gate opening to complete DNA entry. Whether DNA loading is successful or results in loop extrusion might be dictated by a conserved kleisin N-terminal tail that guides the DNA through the kleisin gate. Our results establish the molecular basis for cohesin loading onto DNA."	0

One of them is microcin B17, a bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor whose activity depends on the conversion of selected serine and cysteine residues of the precursor peptide to oxazoles and thiazoles by the McbBCD synthetase complex. Crystal structures of McbBCD reveal an octameric B<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub> complex with two bound substrate peptides. Each McbB dimer clamps the N-terminal recognition sequence, while the C-terminal heterocycle of the modified peptide is trapped in the active site of McbC. The McbD and McbC active sites are distant from each other, which necessitates alternate shuttling of the peptide substrate between them, while remaining tethered to the McbB dimer.

Furthermore, we report that mice deficient in type I IFN signaling have significantly improved control of Leishmania donovani, a causative agent of human VL, associated with enhanced IFNγ but reduced IL-10 production by parasite-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Importantly, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor that can be used to block type I IFN signaling during established infection and acts synergistically with conventional anti-parasitic drugs to improve parasite clearance and enhance anti-parasitic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in mice and humans.

"31302001"	"SENP1-Sirt3 Signaling Controls Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation and Metabolism.Sirt3, as a major mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, is required for mitochondrial metabolic adaption to various stresses. However, how to regulate Sirt3 activity responding to metabolic stress remains largely unknown. Here, we report Sirt3 as a SUMOylated protein in mitochondria. SUMOylation suppresses Sirt3 catalytic activity. SUMOylation-deficient Sirt3 shows elevated deacetylation on mitochondrial proteins and increased fatty acid oxidation. During fasting, SUMO-specific protease SENP1 is accumulated in mitochondria and quickly de-SUMOylates and activates Sirt3. SENP1 deficiency results in hyper-SUMOylation of Sirt3 and hyper-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, which reduces mitochondrial metabolic adaption responding to fasting. Furthermore, we find that fasting induces SENP1 translocation into mitochondria to activate Sirt3. The studies on mice show that Sirt3 SUMOylation mutation reduces fat mass and antagonizes high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity via increasing oxidative phosphorylation and energy expenditure. Our results reveal that SENP1-Sirt3 signaling modulates Sirt3 activation and mitochondrial metabolism during metabolic stress."	0
"32209483"	"Assembly of Peripheral Actomyosin Bundles in Epithelial Cells Is Dependent on the CaMKK2/AMPK Pathway.Defects in the maintenance of intercellular junctions are associated with loss of epithelial barrier function and consequent pathological conditions, including invasive cancers. Epithelial integrity is dependent on actomyosin bundles at adherens junctions, but the origin of these junctional bundles is incompletely understood. Here we show that peripheral actomyosin bundles can be generated from a specific actin stress fiber subtype, transverse arcs, through their lateral fusion at cell-cell contacts. Importantly, we find that assembly and maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles are dependent on the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway and that inhibition of this route leads to disruption of tension-maintaining actomyosin bundles and re-growth of stress fiber precursors. This results in redistribution of cellular forces, defects in monolayer integrity, and loss of epithelial identity. These data provide evidence that the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK pathway is critical for the maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles and thus dictates cell-cell junctions through cellular force distribution."	0
"32023449"	"Human Fc Receptor-like 3 Inhibits Regulatory T Cell Function and Binds Secretory IgA.Human Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3) is an orphan receptor expressed by lymphocytes, including regulatory T cells. FCRL3 is implicated in several autoimmune diseases; however, its function on regulatory T cells is unknown. We discovered that FCRL3 stimulation of regulatory T cells inhibited their suppressive function. Moreover, FCRL3 stimulation induced IL-17, IL-26, and IFNγ production and promoted expression of the Th17-defining transcription factor RORγt without affecting FOXP3 expression. We suggest that FCRL3 engagement mediates a transition of regulatory T cells to a pro-inflammatory Th17-like phenotype. In addition, we identified secretory IgA as a specific FCRL3 ligand. Secretory IgA could serve as an environmental cue for mucosal breaches and locally drive regulatory T cell plasticity to help control infection. Our findings define a mechanism that explains the recognized association of FCRL3 with autoimmune diseases. Targeting FCRL3 to modulate regulatory T cell activity could be exploited to treat both malignancies and autoimmune diseases."	0

We find that mouse ACC exhibits sequence plasticity, but in contrast to V1, the plasticity expresses as a change in response timing, rather than a change in response magnitude. Sequence plasticity is absent in ACC, but not V1, in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability and autism-like features.

Here we examine the role of SMC2 and SMC4, the core subunits of condensin, during endomitosis in schizogony and endoreduplication in male gametogenesis. During early schizogony, SMC2/SMC4 localize to a distinct focus, identified as the centromeres by NDC80 fluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses, but do not form condensin I or II complexes. In mature schizonts and during male gametogenesis, there is a diffuse SMC2/SMC4 distribution on chromosomes and in the nucleus, and both condensin I and condensin II complexes form at these stages. Knockdown of smc2 and smc4 gene expression reveals essential roles in parasite proliferation and transmission.

"32268080"	"A Targeted Multi-omic Analysis Approach Measures Protein Expression and Low-Abundance Transcripts on the Single-Cell Level.High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a frequently used tool to assess immune cell heterogeneity. Recently, the combined measurement of RNA and protein expression was developed, commonly known as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq). Acquisition of protein expression data along with transcriptome data resolves some of the limitations inherent to only assessing transcripts but also nearly doubles the sequencing read depth required per single cell. Furthermore, there is still a paucity of analysis tools to visualize combined transcript-protein datasets. Here, we describe a targeted transcriptomics approach that combines an analysis of over 400 genes with simultaneous measurement of over 40 proteins on 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells in a single experiment. This targeted approach requires only about one-tenth of the read depth compared to a whole-transcriptome approach while retaining high sensitivity for low abundance transcripts.

Here, we used a novel strategy to screen hundreds of sequences for tissue-specific silencer activity in whole Drosophila embryos. Almost all of the transcriptional silencers that we identified were also active enhancers in other cellular contexts. These elements are bound by more transcription factors than non-silencers. A subset of these silencers forms long-range contacts with promoters. Deletion of a silencer caused derepression of its target gene.

"32115407"	"Coordination of germ layer lineage choice by TET1 during primed pluripotency.Gastrulation in the early postimplantation stage mammalian embryo begins when epiblast cells ingress to form the primitive streak or develop as the embryonic ectoderm. The DNA dioxygenase Tet1 is highly expressed in the epiblast and yet continues to regulate lineage specification during gastrulation when its expression is diminished. Here, we show how Tet1 plays a pivotal role upstream of germ layer lineage bifurcation. During the transition from naive pluripotency to lineage priming, a global reconfiguration redistributes Tet1 from Oct4-cobound promoters to distal regulatory elements at lineage differentiation genes, which are distinct from high-affinity sites engaged by Oct4. An altered chromatin landscape in <i>Tet1</i>-deficient primed epiblast-like cells is associated with enhanced Oct4 expression and binding to Nodal and Wnt target genes, resulting in collaborative signals that enhance mesendodermal and inhibit neuroectodermal gene expression during lineage segregation. A permissive role for Tet1 in neural fate induction involves Zic2-dependent engagement at neural target genes at lineage priming, is dependent on the signaling environment during gastrulation, and impacts neural tube closure after gastrulation.

We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from ∼3-5 kb/h up to ∼10-20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA.

Surprisingly, treatment with a BET inhibitor, JQ1, rescued the molecular and functional phenotypes of MeCP2 mutant INs. We uncovered that abnormal increases in chromatin binding of BRD4 and enhancer-promoter interactions underlie the abnormal transcription in MeCP2 mutant INs, which were recovered to normal levels by JQ1. We revealed cell-type-specific transcriptome impairment in MeCP2 mutant region-specific human brain organoids that were rescued by JQ1. Finally, JQ1 ameliorated RTT-like phenotypes in mice.

However, this process lacks the necessary specificity to explain CL diversity, which is especially evident for highly specific CL compositions in mammalian tissues. To investigate the so far elusive regulatory origin of CL homeostasis in mice, we combine lipidomics, integrative transcriptomics, and data-driven machine learning. We demonstrate that not transcriptional regulation, but cellular phospholipid compositions are closely linked to the tissue specificity of CL patterns allowing artificial neural networks to precisely predict cross-tissue CL compositions in a consistent mechanistic specificity rationale. This is especially relevant for the interpretation of disease-related perturbations of CL homeostasis, by allowing differentiation between specific aberrations in CL metabolism and changes caused by global alterations in cellular (phospho-)lipid metabolism."	0

This metabolism-epigenome link sensitizes chromatin methylation to altered SAM abundance, yet the mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt and protect epigenetic information during life-experienced fluctuations in SAM availability are unknown. We identified a robust response to SAM depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under SAM-depleted conditions, H3K9 mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to SAM depletion in vivo. Together, these studies provide evidence for an adaptive response that enables epigenetic persistence to metabolic stress."	0

By systematically varying LIN28B protein levels in human cells, we discovered a dose-dependent divergence in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy that enabled the formation of two discrete translational subpopulations composed of nearly all expressed genes. This bifurcation in gene expression was mediated by a redistribution in Argonaute association, from let-7 to non-let-7 microRNA families, resulting in a global shift in cellular miRNA activity. Post-transcriptional effects were scaled across the physiological LIN28 expression range. Together, these data highlight the central importance of RBP expression level and its ability to encode regulation."	0

Transfer of genetic material is achieved mainly through extracellular vesicles (EVs), although cell fusion also plays a minor role. We further demonstrate that EV-mediated communication leads to the increase of synaptic activity in neurons. Blocking EV release causes a reduction of glioma growth in vivo. Our findings indicate that EV-mediated interaction between glioma cells and non-glioma brain cells alters the tumor microenvironment and contributes to glioma development."	0
"31759821"	"Fork Cleavage-Religation Cycle and Active Transcription Mediate Replication Restart after Fork Stalling at Co-transcriptional R-Loops.Formation of co-transcriptional R-loops underlies replication fork stalling upon head-on transcription-replication encounters. Here, we demonstrate that RAD51-dependent replication fork reversal induced by R-loops is followed by the restart of semiconservative DNA replication mediated by RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases, MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, RAD52 strand-annealing factor, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)/XRCC4 complex, and the non-catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, POLD3. RECQ5 disrupts RAD51 filaments assembled on stalled forks after RECQ1-mediated reverse branch migration, preventing a new round of fork reversal and facilitating fork cleavage by MUS81/EME1. MUS81-dependent DNA breaks accumulate in cells lacking RAD52 or LIG4 upon induction of R-loop formation, suggesting that RAD52 acts in concert with LIG4/XRCC4 to catalyze fork religation, thereby mediating replication restart. The resumption of DNA synthesis after R-loop-associated fork stalling also requires active transcription, the restoration of which depends on MUS81, RAD52, LIG4, and the transcription elongation factor ELL. These findings provide mechanistic insights into transcription-replication conflict resolution."	0
"32783932"	"Distinct Waves from the Hemogenic Endothelium Give Rise to Layered Lymphoid Tissue Inducer Cell Ontogeny.During embryogenesis, lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells are essential for lymph node organogenesis. These cells are part of the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family. Although their earliest embryonic hematopoietic origin is unclear, other innate immune cells have been shown to be derived from early hemogenic endothelium in the yolk sac as well as the aorta-gonad-mesonephros. A proper model to discriminate between these locations was unavailable. In this study, using a Cxcr4-CreERT2 lineage tracing model, we identify a major contribution from embryonic hemogenic endothelium, but not the yolk sac, toward LTi progenitors. Conversely, embryonic LTi cells are replaced by hematopoietic stem cell-derived cells in adults. We further show that, in the fetal liver, common lymphoid progenitors differentiate into highly dynamic alpha-lymphoid precursor cells that, at this embryonic stage, preferentially mature into LTi precursors and establish their functional LTi cell identity only after reaching the periphery."	0
"32651229"	"Retromer forms low order oligomers on supported lipid bilayers.Retromer orchestrates the selection and export of integral membrane proteins from the endosome via retrograde and plasma membrane recycling pathways. Long-standing hypotheses regarding the retromer sorting mechanism posit that oligomeric interactions between retromer and associated accessory factors on the endosome membrane drives clustering of retromer-bound integral membrane cargo prior to its packaging into a nascent transport carrier. To test this idea, we examined interactions between components of the sorting nexin 3 (SNX3)-retromer sorting pathway using quantitative single particle fluorescence microscopy in a reconstituted system. This system includes a supported lipid bilayer, fluorescently labeled retromer, SNX3, and two model cargo proteins, RAB7, and retromer-binding segments of the WASHC2C subunit of the WASH complex. We found that the distribution of membrane-associated retromer is predominantly comprised of monomer (∼18%), dimer (∼35%), trimer (∼24%), and tetramer (∼13%). Unexpectedly, neither the presence of membrane-associated cargo nor accessory factors substantially affected this distribution. The results indicate that retromer has an intrinsic propensity to form low order oligomers on a supported lipid bilayer and that neither membrane association nor accessory factors potentiate oligomerization. The results support a model whereby SNX3-retromer is a minimally concentrative coat protein complex adapted to bulk membrane trafficking from the endosomal system."	0

The relevance of cell-surface glycosylation to HIV persistence has never been explored. We characterize the relationship between cell-surface glycomic signatures and persistent HIV transcription in vivo. We find that the cell surface of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells actively transcribing HIV, despite suppressive therapy, harbors high levels of fucosylated carbohydrate ligands, including the cell extravasation mediator Sialyl-Lewis<sup>X</sup> (SLe<sup>X</sup>), compared with HIV-infected transcriptionally inactive cells.

"30503774"	"Dynamics of Cas10 Govern Discrimination between Self and Non-self in Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity.Adaptive immune systems must accurately distinguish between self and non-self in order to defend against invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNA to recognize complementary RNA targets, which triggers the degradation of both the invader's transcripts and their template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations but circumvent damage to the host genome. To explore the molecular basis for these features, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10-the DNase effector of the complex-displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Target mutations differentially modulate Cas10 dynamics and tune the CRISPR interference activity in vivo. These findings highlight the central role of the internal dynamics of CRISPR-Cas complexes in self versus non-self discrimination and target specificity."	0

"30975460"	"RRM Transcription Factors Interact with NLRs and Regulate Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Rice.Nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors perceive pathogen effectors and trigger plant immunity. However, the mechanisms underlying NLR-triggered defense responses remain obscure. The recently discovered Pigm locus in rice encodes a cluster of NLRs, including PigmR, which confers broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus. Here, we identify PIBP1 (PigmR-INTERACTING and BLAST RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1), an RRM (RNA-recognition motif) protein that specifically interacts with PigmR and other similar NLRs to trigger blast resistance. PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance. We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression. Knockout of PIBP1 and Os06 g02240 greatly attenuated blast resistance. Collectively, our study discovers previously unappreciated RRM transcription factors that directly interact with NLRs to activate plant defense, establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of immune responses with NLR-mediated pathogen perception."	0
"31981475"	"The G3BP1-Family-USP10 Deubiquitinase Complex Rescues Ubiquitinated 40S Subunits of Ribosomes Stalled in Translation from Lysosomal Degradation.Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) purges aberrant mRNAs and nascent polypeptides in a multi-step molecular process initiated by the E3 ligase ZNF598 through sensing of ribosomes collided at aberrant mRNAs and monoubiquitination of distinct small ribosomal subunit proteins. We show that G3BP1-family-USP10 complexes are required for deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3, and RPS10 to rescue modified 40S subunits from programmed degradation. Knockout of USP10 or G3BP1 family proteins increased lysosomal ribosomal degradation and perturbed ribosomal subunit stoichiometry, both of which were rescued by a single K214R substitution of RPS3. While the majority of RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination resulted from ZNF598-dependent sensing of ribosome collisions initiating RQC, another minor pathway contributed to their monoubiquitination. G3BP1 family proteins have long been considered RNA-binding proteins, however, our results identified 40S subunits and associated mRNAs as their predominant targets, a feature shared by stress granules to which G3BP1 family proteins localize under stress."	1
"32130906"	"Single-Cell Analysis of Foxp1-Driven Mechanisms Essential for Striatal Development.The striatum is a critical forebrain structure integrating cognitive, sensory, and motor information from diverse brain regions into meaningful behavioral output. However, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying striatal development at single-cell resolution remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the cellular diversity of the early postnatal striatum and show that Foxp1, a transcription factor strongly linked to autism and intellectual disability, regulates the cellular composition, neurochemical architecture, and connectivity of the striatum in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We also identify Foxp1-regulated target genes within distinct cell types and connect these molecular changes to functional and behavioral deficits relevant to phenotypes described in patients with FOXP1 loss-of-function mutations. Using this approach, we could also examine the non-cell-autonomous effects produced by disrupting one cell type and the molecular compensation that occurs in other populations. These data reveal the cell-type-specific transcriptional mechanisms regulated by Foxp1 that underlie distinct features of striatal circuitry."	0
"32610124"	"Mapping of Influenza Virus RNA-RNA Interactions Reveals a Flexible Network.Selective assembly of influenza virus segments into virions is proposed to be mediated through intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. Here, we developed a method called 2CIMPL that includes proximity ligation under native conditions to identify genome-wide RNA duplexes. Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation. Overall, 2CIMPL is a versatile technique to map in vivo RNA-RNA interactions."	0

The molecular function of the encoded protein, myosin-18B (M18B), within the developing muscle is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant M18B lacks motor ATPase activity and harbors previously uncharacterized N-terminal actin-binding domains, properties that make M18B an efficient actin cross-linker and molecular brake capable of regulating muscle myosin-2 contractile forces. Spatiotemporal analysis of M18B throughout cardiomyogenesis and myofibrillogenesis reveals that this structural myosin undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution during myogenic differentiation, where its incorporation within muscle stress fibers coincides with actin striation onset. Furthermore, this analysis shows that M18B is directly integrated within the muscle myosin thick filament during myofibril maturation. Altogether, our data suggest that M18B has evolved specific biochemical properties that allow it to define and maintain sarcomeric organization from within the thick filament via its dual actin cross-linking and motor modulating capabilities."	0
"32460027"	"A Landscape of Murine Long Non-Coding RNAs Reveals the Leading Transcriptome Alterations in Adipose Tissue during Aging.Aging is an inevitable process that involves profound physiological changes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in various biological processes but are not systemically studied in aging. To provide an organism-wide lncRNA landscape during aging, we conduct comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses across the mouse lifespan. Of the 1,675 aging-regulated lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) identified, the majority are connected to inflammation-related biological pathways. AR-lncRNAs exhibit high tissue specificity; conversely, those with higher tissue specificity are preferentially regulated during aging. White adipose tissue (WAT) displays the highest number of AR-lncRNAs and develops the most dynamic crosstalk between AR-lncRNA and AR-mRNA during aging. An adipose-enriched AR-lncRNA, lnc-adipoAR1, is negatively correlated with aging, and knocking it down inhibits adipogenesis, phenocopying the compromised adipogenic capacity of aged fat. Our works together reveal AR-lncRNAs as essential components in aging and suggest that although each tissue ages in a distinct manner, WAT is a leading contributor to aging-related health decline."	0
"31201090"	"Transient DNA Occupancy of the SMC Interarm Space in Prokaryotic Condensin.Multi-subunit SMC ATPases control chromosome superstructure and DNA topology, presumably by DNA translocation and loop extrusion. Chromosomal DNA is entrapped within the tripartite SMCkleisin ring. Juxtaposed SMC heads (""J heads"") or engaged SMC heads (""E heads"") split the SMCkleisin ring into ""S"" and ""K"" sub-compartments. Here, we map a DNA-binding interface to the S compartment of E heads SmcScpAB and show that head-DNA association is essential for efficient DNA translocation and for traversing highly transcribed genes in Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that in J heads, SmcScpAB chromosomal DNA resides in the K compartment but is absent from the S compartment. Our results imply that the DNA occupancy of the S compartment changes during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. We propose that DNA translocation involves DNA entry into and exit out of the S compartment, possibly by DNA transfer between compartments and DNA segment capture."	0
"32814045"	"Identification of a pH-Sensitive Switch in VSV-G and a Crystal Structure of the G Pre-fusion State Highlight the VSV-G Structural Transition Pathway.VSV fusion machinery, like that of many other enveloped viruses, is triggered at low pH in endosomes after virion endocytosis. It was suggested that some histidines could play the role of pH-sensitive switches. By mutating histidine residues H22, H60, H132, H162, H389, H397, H407, and H409, we demonstrate that residues H389 and D280, facing each other in the six-helix bundle of the post-fusion state, and more prominently H407, located at the interface between the C-terminal part of the ectodomain and the fusion domain, are crucial for fusion. Passages of recombinant viruses bearing mutant G resulted in the selection of compensatory mutations. Thus, the H407A mutation in G resulted in two independent compensatory mutants, L396I and S422I. Together with a crystal structure of G, presented here, which extends our knowledge of G pre-fusion structure, this indicates that the conformational transition is initiated by refolding of the C-terminal part of the G ectodomain."	0
"32937136"	"PRC2 Acts as a Critical Timer That Drives Oligodendrocyte Fate over Astrocyte Identity by Repressing the Notch Pathway.PRC2 creates the repressive mark histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation. Although PRC2 is involved in various biological processes, its role in glial development remains ambiguous. Here, we show that PRC2 is required for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, but not for OL precursor formation. PRC2-deficient OL lineage cells differentiate into OL precursors, but they fail to trigger the molecular program for myelination, highlighting that PRC2 is essential for directing the differentiation timing of OL precursors. PRC2 null OL lineage cells aberrantly induce Notch pathway genes and acquire astrocytic features. The repression of the Notch pathway restores the myelination program and inhibits abnormal astrocytic differentiation in the PRC2-deficient OL lineage, indicating that Notch is a major target of PRC2. Altogether, our studies propose a specific action of PRC2 as a novel gatekeeper that determines the glial fate choice and the timing of OL lineage progression and myelination by impinging on the Notch pathway."	0
"32571873"	"Runt-related transcription factor 1 is required for murine osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.Despite years of research investigating osteoblast differentiation, the mechanisms by which transcription factors regulate osteoblast maturation, bone formation, and bone homeostasis is still unclear. It has been reported that runt-related transcription factor 1 (<i>Runx1</i>) is expressed in osteoblast progenitors, pre-osteoblasts, and mature osteoblasts; yet, surprisingly, the exact function of RUNX1 in osteoblast maturation and bone formation remains unknown. Here, we generated and characterized a pre-osteoblast and differentiating chondrocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i> conditional knockout mouse model to study RUNX1's function in bone formation. <i>Runx1</i> ablation in osteoblast precursors and differentiating chondrocytes via osterix-Cre (Osx-Cre) resulted in an osteoporotic phenotype and decreased bone density in the long bones and skulls of <i>Runx1<sup>f/f</sup>Osx-Cre</i> mice compared with <i>Runx1<sup>f/f</sup></i> and <i>Osx-Cre</i> mice. RUNX1 deficiency reduced the expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), Indian hedgehog signaling molecule (IHH), Patched (PTC), and cyclin D1 in the growth plate, and also reduced the expression of osteocalcin (OCN), OSX, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and RUNX2 in osteoblasts. ChIP assays and promoter activity mapping revealed that RUNX1 directly associates with the <i>Runx2</i> gene promoter and up-regulates <i>Runx2</i> expression. Furthermore, the ChIP data also showed that RUNX1 associates with the <i>Ocn</i> promoter. In conclusion, RUNX1 up-regulates the expression of <i>Runx2</i> and multiple bone-specific genes, and plays an indispensable role in bone formation and homeostasis in both trabecular and cortical bone. We propose that stimulating <i>Runx1</i> activity may be useful in therapeutic approaches for managing some bone diseases such as osteoporosis."	1

The formation of triple helices is one mechanism of sequence-specific targeting of RNA to chromatin. With this study, we show an important role of the nucleosome and its relative positioning to the triplex targeting site (TTS) in stabilizing RNA-DNA triplexes in vitro and in vivo. Triplex stabilization depends on the histone H3 tail and the location of the TTS close to the nucleosomal DNA entry-exit site. Genome-wide analysis of TTS-nucleosome arrangements revealed a defined chromatin organization with an enrichment of arrangements that allow triplex formation at active regulatory sites and accessible chromatin. We further developed a method to monitor nucleosome-RNA triplexes in vivo (TRIP-seq), revealing RNA binding to TTS sites adjacent to nucleosomes. Our data strongly support an activating role for RNA triplex-nucleosome complexes, pinpointing triplex-mediated epigenetic regulation in vivo."	0
"32518155"	"The J-elongated conformation of β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I predominates in solution: implications for our understanding of antiphospholipid syndrome.β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I (β<sub>2</sub>GPI) is an abundant plasma protein displaying phospholipid-binding properties. Because it binds phospholipids, it is a target of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic disease. Indeed, aPLs prefer membrane-bound β<sub>2</sub>GPI to that in solution. β<sub>2</sub>GPI exists in two almost equally populated redox states: oxidized, in which all the disulfide bonds are formed, and reduced, in which one or more disulfide bonds are broken. Furthermore, β<sub>2</sub>GPI can adopt multiple conformations (<i>i.e.</i> J-elongated, S-twisted, and O-circular). While strong evidence indicates that the J-form is the structure bound to aPLs, which conformation exists and predominates in solution remains controversial, and so is the conformational pathway leading to the bound state. Here, we report that human recombinant β<sub>2</sub>GPI purified under native conditions is oxidized. Moreover, under physiological pH and salt concentrations, this oxidized form adopts a J-elongated, flexible conformation, not circular or twisted, in which the N-terminal domain I (DI) and the C-terminal domain V (DV) are exposed to the solvent. Consistent with this model, binding kinetics and mutagenesis experiments revealed that in solution the J-form interacts with negatively charged liposomes and with MBB2, a monoclonal anti-DI antibody that recapitulates most of the features of pathogenic aPLs. We conclude that the preferential binding of aPLs to phospholipid-bound β<sub>2</sub>GPI arises from the ability of its preexisting J-form to accumulate on the membranes, thereby offering an ideal environment for aPL binding. We propose that targeting the J-form of β<sub>2</sub>GPI provides a strategy to block pathogenic aPLs in APS."	0
"32576658"	"Structural analysis of the catalytic domain of Artemis endonuclease/SNM1C reveals distinct structural features.The endonuclease Artemis is responsible for opening DNA hairpins during V(D)J recombination and for processing a subset of pathological DNA double-strand breaks. Artemis is an attractive target for the development of therapeutics to manage various B cell and T cell tumors, because failure to open DNA hairpins and accumulation of chromosomal breaks may reduce the proliferation and viability of pre-T and pre-B cell derivatives. However, structure-based drug discovery of specific Artemis inhibitors has been hampered by a lack of crystal structures. Here, we report the structure of the catalytic domain of recombinant human Artemis. The catalytic domain displayed a polypeptide fold similar overall to those of other members in the DNA cross-link repair gene SNM1 family and in mRNA 3'-end-processing endonuclease CPSF-73, containing metallo-β-lactamase and β-CASP domains and a cluster of conserved histidine and aspartate residues capable of binding two metal atoms in the catalytic site. As in SNM1A, only one zinc ion was located in the Artemis active site. However, Artemis displayed several unique features. Unlike in other members of this enzyme class, a second zinc ion was present in the β-CASP domain that leads to structural reorientation of the putative DNA-binding surface and extends the substrate-binding pocket to a new pocket, pocket III. Moreover, the substrate-binding surface exhibited a dominant and extensive positive charge distribution compared with that in the structures of SNM1A and SNM1B, presumably because of the structurally distinct DNA substrate of Artemis. The structural features identified here may provide opportunities for designing selective Artemis inhibitors."	0
"30852060"	"Obstacles to Scanning by RNase E Govern Bacterial mRNA Lifetimes by Hindering Access to Distal Cleavage Sites.The diversity of mRNA lifetimes in bacterial cells is difficult to reconcile with the relaxed cleavage site specificity of RNase E, the endonuclease most important for governing mRNA degradation. This enzyme has generally been thought to locate cleavage sites by searching freely in three dimensions. However, our results now show that its access to such sites in 5'-monophosphorylated RNA is hindered by obstacles-such as bound proteins or ribosomes or coaxial small RNA (sRNA) base pairing-that disrupt the path from the 5' end to those sites and prolong mRNA lifetimes. These findings suggest that RNase E searches for cleavage sites by scanning linearly from the 5'-terminal monophosphate along single-stranded regions of RNA and that its progress is impeded by structural discontinuities encountered along the way. This discovery has major implications for gene regulation in bacteria and suggests a general mechanism by which other prokaryotic and eukaryotic regulatory proteins can be controlled."	0

They can be activated and polarized into tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) by the tumor-derived soluble molecules to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we used comparative metabolomics coupled with biochemical and animal studies to show that cancer cells release succinate into their microenvironment and activate succinate receptor (SUCNR1) signaling to polarize macrophages into TAM. Furthermore, the results from in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that succinate promotes not only cancer cell migration and invasion but also cancer metastasis. These effects are mediated by SUCNR1-triggered PI3K-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) axis. Compared with healthy subjects and tumor-free lung tissues, serum succinate levels and lung cancer SUCNR1 expression were elevated in lung cancer patients, suggesting an important clinical relevance.

Here, using Vglut1 as a marker for inputs from cortical structures, we identify a small population of excitatory neurons located in the posterior amygdala (PA) that project to the ventrolateral division of ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHvl), a region that critically regulates territorial aggression. Indeed, activities of PA Vglut1+ (PA<sup>Vglut1</sup>) neurons, as analyzed by post hoc c-Fos expression, differentiate trials in which attacks occur, or not, during resident-intruder assays. More importantly, chemogenetic activation of VMHvl-projecting PA<sup>Vglut1</sup> neurons robustly promote aggression while inhibition of these neurons reduces attacks. Finally, a connectivity map places VMHvl-projecting PA<sup>Vglut1</sup> neurons at the interface between emotion regulation and aggression as they receive broad inputs from limbic structures and project collaterally to the VMHvl and other targets. Taken together, these results point to VMHvl-projecting PA<sup>Vglut1</sup> neurons as a potential site for cortical gating of territorial aggression."	0

This led us to develop a model of airway basal stem cell (ABSC) hyperproliferation by driving Wnt/β-catenin signaling, resulting in a morphology that resembles premalignant lesions and loss of ciliated cell differentiation. To identify small molecules that could reverse this process, we performed a high-throughput drug screen for inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our studies unveil Wnt inhibitor compound 1 (WIC1), which suppresses T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) activity, reduces ABSC proliferation, induces ciliated cell differentiation, and decreases nuclear p-β-catenin<sup>Y489</sup>. Collectively, our work elucidates a dysregulated Wnt/p-β-catenin<sup>Y489</sup> axis in lung premalignancy that can be modeled in vitro and identifies a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor that promotes airway homeostasis.

"32234478"	"Macaques Exhibit Implicit Gaze Bias Anticipating Others' False-Belief-Driven Actions via Medial Prefrontal Cortex.The ability to infer others' mental states is essential to social interactions. This ability, critically evaluated by testing whether one attributes false beliefs (FBs) to others, has been considered to be uniquely hominid and to accompany the activation of a distributed brain network. We challenge the taxon specificity of this ability and identify the causal brain locus by introducing an anticipatory-looking FB paradigm combined with chemogenetic neuronal manipulation in macaque monkeys. We find spontaneous gaze bias of macaques implicitly anticipating others' FB-driven actions. Silencing of the medial prefrontal neuronal activity with inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) specifically eliminates the implicit gaze bias while leaving the animals' visually guided and memory-guided tracking abilities intact. Thus, neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex could have a causal role in FB-attribution-like behaviors in the primate lineage, emphasizing the importance of probing the neuronal mechanisms underlying theory of mind with relevant macaque animal models."	0

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are differentiated to β cells (SC-β cells) and mature to undergo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but molecular regulation of this defining β cell phenotype is unknown. Here, we show that maturation of SC-β cells is regulated by the transcription factor SIX2. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of SIX2 in SC-β cells drastically limits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in both static and dynamic assays, along with the upstream processes of cytoplasmic calcium flux and mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, SIX2 regulates the expression of genes associated with these key β cell processes, and its expression is restricted to endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate that expression of SIX2 influences the generation of human SC-β cells in vitro."	0

We found that BRCA2-deficient cells are selectively dependent on multiple pathways including base excision repair, ATR signaling, and splicing. We identified APEX2 and FEN1 as synthetic lethal genes with both BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss of function. BRCA2-deficient cells require the apurinic endonuclease activity and the PCNA-binding domain of Ape2 (APEX2), but not Ape1 (APEX1). Furthermore, BRCA2-deficient cells require the 5' flap endonuclease but not the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Fen1, and chemically inhibiting Fen1 selectively targets BRCA-deficient cells. Finally, we developed a microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) reporter and showed that Fen1 participates in MMEJ, underscoring the importance of MMEJ as a collateral repair pathway in the context of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency."	0
"32130898"	"Gut Dysbiosis during Influenza Contributes to Pulmonary Pneumococcal Superinfection through Altered Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production.Secondary bacterial infections often complicate viral respiratory infections. We hypothesize that perturbation of the gut microbiota during influenza A virus (IAV) infection might favor respiratory bacterial superinfection. Sublethal infection with influenza transiently alters the composition and fermentative activity of the gut microbiota in mice. These changes are attributed in part to reduced food consumption. Fecal transfer experiments demonstrate that the IAV-conditioned microbiota compromises lung defenses against pneumococcal infection. In mechanistic terms, reduced production of the predominant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate affects the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages. Following treatment with acetate, mice colonized with the IAV-conditioned microbiota display reduced bacterial loads. In the context of influenza infection, acetate supplementation reduces, in a free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)-dependent manner, local and systemic bacterial loads. This translates into reduced lung pathology and improved survival rates of double-infected mice. Lastly, pharmacological activation of the SCFA receptor FFAR2 during influenza reduces bacterial superinfection."	0
"32616519"	"A role for alternative splicing in circadian control of exocytosis and glucose homeostasis.The circadian clock is encoded by a negative transcriptional feedback loop that coordinates physiology and behavior through molecular programs that remain incompletely understood.

We show that the RNA-binding protein THRAP3 (thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3) regulates circadian clock-dependent AS by binding to exons at coding sequences flanking exons that are more frequently skipped in clock mutant β cells, including transcripts encoding <i>Cask</i> (<i>calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase</i>) and <i>Madd</i> (<i>MAP kinase-activating death domain</i>). Depletion of THRAP3 restores expression of the long isoforms of <i>Cask</i> and <i>Madd</i>, and mimicking exon skipping in these transcripts through antisense oligonucleotide delivery in wild-type islets reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

"32553163"	"Modulation of Extracellular ISG15 Signaling by Pathogens and Viral Effector Proteins.ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that also functions extracellularly, signaling through the LFA-1 integrin to promote interferon (IFN)-γ release from natural killer (NK) and T cells. The signals that lead to the production of extracellular ISG15 and the relationship between its two core functions remain unclear. We show that both epithelial cells and lymphocytes can secrete ISG15, which then signals in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to LFA-1-expressing cells. Microbial pathogens and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists result in both IFN-β-dependent and -independent secretion of ISG15, and residues required for ISG15 secretion are mapped. Intracellular ISGylation inhibits secretion, and viral effector proteins, influenza B NS1, and viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PL<sup>pro</sup>, have opposing effects on secretion of ISG15. These results establish extracellular ISG15 as a cytokine-like protein that bridges early innate and IFN-γ-dependent immune responses, and indicate that pathogens have evolved to differentially inhibit the intracellular and extracellular functions of ISG15."	0
"32579931"	"Single-Cell Profiling and SCOPE-Seq Reveal Lineage Dynamics of Adult Ventricular-Subventricular Zone Neurogenesis and NOTUM as a Key Regulator.In the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new olfactory bulb (OB) neurons and glia throughout life. To map adult neuronal lineage progression, we profiled >56,000 V-SVZ and OB cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal the molecular diversity of OB neurons, including fate-mapped neurons, lineage progression dynamics, and an NSC intermediate enriched for Notum, which encodes a secreted WNT antagonist. SCOPE-seq technology, which links live-cell imaging with scRNA-seq, uncovers cell-size transitions during NSC differentiation and preferential NOTUM binding to proliferating neuronal precursors. Consistently, application of NOTUM protein in slice cultures and pharmacological inhibition of NOTUM in slice cultures and in vivo demonstrated that NOTUM negatively regulates V-SVZ proliferation. Timely, context-dependent neurogenesis demands adaptive signaling among neighboring progenitors. Our findings highlight a critical regulatory state during NSC activation marked by NOTUM, which attenuates WNT-stimulated proliferation in NSC progeny."	0
"32029457"	"Interplay between compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and consumption: a focus on the PARP family.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is an essential cofactor for redox enzymes, but also moonlights as a substrate for signaling enzymes. When used as a substrate by signaling enzymes, it is consumed, necessitating the recycling of NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption products (i.e., nicotinamide) via a salvage pathway in order to maintain NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. A major family of NAD<sup>+</sup> consumers in mammalian cells are poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs). PARPs comprise a family of 17 enzymes in humans, 16 of which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD<sup>+</sup> to macromolecular targets (namely, proteins, but also DNA and RNA). Because PARPs and the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes are subcellularly localized, an emerging concept is that the activity of PARPs and other NAD<sup>+</sup> consumers are regulated in a compartmentalized manner. In this review, I discuss NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, how different subcellular pools of NAD<sup>+</sup> are established and regulated, and how free NAD<sup>+</sup> levels can control signaling by PARPs and redox metabolism."	0
"32546480"	"Differences in self-association between kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 are associated with differential integrin binding.The integrin family of transmembrane adhesion receptors coordinates complex signaling networks that control the ability of cells to sense and communicate with the extracellular environment. Kindlin proteins are a central cytoplasmic component of these networks, directly binding integrin cytoplasmic domains and mediating interactions with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. The physiological importance of kindlins is well established, but how the scaffolding functions of kindlins are regulated at the molecular level is still unclear. Here, using a combination of GFP nanotrap association assays, pulldown and integrin-binding assays, and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that full-length kindlins can oligomerize (self-associate) in mammalian cells, and we propose that this self-association inhibits integrin binding and kindlin localization to focal adhesions. We show that both kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 can self-associate and that kindlin-3 self-association is more robust. Using chimeric mapping, we demonstrate that the F2PH and F3 subdomains are important for kindlin self-association. Through comparative sequence analysis of kindlin-2 and kindlin-3, we identify kindlin-3 point mutations that decrease self-association and enhance integrin binding, affording mutant kindlin-3 the ability to localize to focal adhesions. Our results support the notion that kindlin self-association negatively regulates integrin binding."	0
"31679819"	"R-Loops Promote Antisense Transcription across the Mammalian Genome.Widespread antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) overlap with many protein-coding genes in mammals and emanate from gene promoter, enhancer, and termination regions. However, their origin and biological purpose remain unclear. We show that these antisense lncRNA can be generated by R-loops that form when nascent transcript invades the DNA duplex behind elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Biochemically, R-loops act as intrinsic Pol II promoters to induce de novo RNA synthesis. Furthermore, their removal across the human genome by RNase H1 overexpression causes the selective reduction of antisense transcription. Consequently, we predict that R-loops act to facilitate the synthesis of many gene proximal antisense lncRNA. Not only are R-loops widely associated with DNA damage and repair, but we now show that they have the capacity to promote de novo transcript synthesis that may have aided the evolution of gene regulation."	0
"32160538"	"Genomic Repeats Categorize Genes with Distinct Functions for Orchestrated Regulation.Repetitive elements are abundantly distributed in mammalian genomes. Here, we reveal a striking association between repeat subtypes and gene function. SINE, L1, and low-complexity repeats demarcate distinct functional categories of genes and may dictate the time and level of gene expression by providing binding sites for different regulatory proteins. Importantly, imaging and sequencing analysis show that L1 repeats sequester a large set of genes with specialized functions in nucleolus- and lamina-associated inactive domains that are depleted of SINE repeats. In addition, L1 transcripts bind extensively to its DNA in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Depletion of L1 RNA in ESCs leads to relocation of L1-enriched chromosomal segments from inactive domains to the nuclear interior and de-repression of L1-associated genes. These results demonstrate a role of L1 DNA and RNA in gene silencing and suggest a general theme of genomic repeats in orchestrating the function, regulation, and expression of their host genes."	0
"32130909"	"Transmembrane Coordination of Preprotein Recognition and Motor Coupling by the Mitochondrial Presequence Receptor Tim50.Mitochondrial preproteins contain amino-terminal presequences directing them to the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23 complex). Depending on additional downstream import signals, TIM23 either inserts preproteins into the inner membrane or translocates them into the matrix. Matrix import requires the coupling of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) to TIM23. The molecular mechanisms coordinating preprotein recognition by TIM23 in the intermembrane space (IMS) with PAM activation in the matrix are unknown. Here we show that subsequent to presequence recognition in the IMS, the Tim50 matrix domain facilitates the recruitment of the coupling factor Pam17. Next, the IMS domain of Tim50 promotes PAM recruitment to TIM23. Finally, the Tim50 transmembrane segment stimulates the matrix-directed import-driving force exerted by PAM. We propose that recognition of preprotein segments in the IMS and transfer of signal information across the inner membrane by Tim50 determine import motor activation."	0

"32755591"	"Structural and Mechanistic Regulation of the Pro-degenerative NAD Hydrolase SARM1.The NADase SARM1 is a central switch in injury-activated axon degeneration, an early hallmark of many neurological diseases. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of autoinhibited (3.3 Å) and active SARM1 (6.8 Å) and provide mechanistic insight into the tight regulation of SARM1's function by the local metabolic environment. Although both states retain an octameric core, the defining feature of the autoinhibited state is a lock between the autoinhibitory Armadillo/HEAT motif (ARM) and catalytic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, which traps SARM1 in an inactive state. Mutations that break this lock activate SARM1, resulting in catastrophic neuronal death. Notably, the mutants cannot be further activated by the endogenous activator nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and active SARM1 is product inhibited by Nicotinamide (NAM), highlighting SARM1's functional dependence on key metabolites in the NAD salvage pathway. Our studies provide a molecular understanding of SARM1's transition from an autoinhibited to an injury-activated state and lay the foundation for future SARM1-based therapies to treat axonopathies."	0
"32698007"	"Degradation of Non-coding RNAs Promotes Recycling of Termination Factors at Sites of Transcription.A large share of the non-coding transcriptome in yeast is controlled by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which promotes transcription termination of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and by the nuclear exosome, which limits the steady-state levels of the transcripts produced. How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation."	0
"31902668"	"MicroRNAs Cause Accelerated Decay of Short-Tailed Target mRNAs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) specify the recruitment of deadenylases to mRNA targets. Despite this recruitment, we find that miRNAs have almost no effect on steady-state poly(A)-tail lengths of their targets in mouse fibroblasts, which motivates the acquisition of pre-steady-state measurements of the effects of miRNAs on tail lengths, mRNA levels, and translational efficiencies. Effects on translational efficiency are minimal compared to effects on mRNA levels, even for newly transcribed target mRNAs. Effects on target mRNA levels accumulate as the mRNA population approaches steady state, whereas effects on tail lengths peak for recently transcribed target mRNAs and then subside. Computational modeling of this phenomenon reveals that miRNAs cause not only accelerated deadenylation of their targets but also accelerated decay of short-tailed target molecules. This unanticipated effect of miRNAs largely prevents short-tailed target mRNAs from accumulating despite accelerated target deadenylation. The net result is a nearly imperceptible change to the steady-state tail-length distribution of targeted mRNAs."	0
"32905764"	"iPSC Modeling of RBM20-Deficient DCM Identifies Upregulation of RBM20 as a Therapeutic Strategy.Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) make it possible to model genetic heart disease in vitro. We apply CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to introduce three RBM20 mutations in iPSCs and differentiate them into iPSC-CMs to establish an in vitro model of RBM20 mutant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In iPSC-CMs harboring a known causal RBM20 variant, the splicing of RBM20 target genes, calcium handling, and contractility are impaired consistent with the disease manifestation in patients. A variant (Pro633Leu) identified by exome sequencing of patient genomes displays the same disease phenotypes, thus establishing this variant as disease causing. We find that all-trans retinoic acid upregulates RBM20 expression and reverts the splicing, calcium handling, and contractility defects in iPSC-CMs with different causal RBM20 mutations. These results suggest that pharmacological upregulation of RBM20 expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for DCM patients with a heterozygous mutation in RBM20."	0
"31226278"	"Modeling RNA-Binding Protein Specificity In Vivo by Precisely Registering Protein-RNA Crosslink Sites.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by recognizing short and degenerate sequence motifs in their target transcripts, but precisely defining their binding specificity remains challenging. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) allows for mapping of the exact protein-RNA crosslink sites, which frequently reside at specific positions in RBP motifs at single-nucleotide resolution. Here, we have developed a computational method, named mCross, to jointly model RBP binding specificity while precisely registering the crosslinking position in motif sites. We applied mCross to 112 RBPs using ENCODE eCLIP data and validated the reliability of the discovered motifs by genome-wide analysis of allelic binding sites. Our analyses revealed that the prototypical SR protein SRSF1 recognizes clusters of GGA half-sites in addition to its canonical GGAGGA motif. Therefore, SRSF1 regulates splicing of a much larger repertoire of transcripts than previously appreciated, including HNRNPD and HNRNPDL, which are involved in multivalent protein assemblies and phase separation."	0
"32101750"	"Dissecting the Regulatory Strategies of NF-κB RelA Target Genes in the Inflammatory Response Reveals Differential Transactivation Logics.Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) RelA is the potent transcriptional activator of inflammatory response genes. We stringently defined a list of direct RelA target genes by integrating physical (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) and functional (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq] in knockouts) datasets. We then dissected each gene's regulatory strategy by testing RelA variants in a primary-cell genetic-complementation assay. All endogenous target genes require RelA to make DNA-base-specific contacts, and none are activatable by the DNA binding domain alone. However, endogenous target genes differ widely in how they employ the two transactivation domains. Through model-aided analysis of the dynamic time-course data, we reveal the gene-specific synergy and redundancy of TA1 and TA2. Given that post-translational modifications control TA1 activity and intrinsic affinity for coactivators determines TA2 activity, the differential TA logics suggests context-dependent versus context-independent control of endogenous RelA-target genes. Although some inflammatory initiators appear to require co-stimulatory TA1 activation, inflammatory resolvers are a part of the NF-κB RelA core response."	0
"32697989"	"The Human Integrator Complex Facilitates Transcriptional Elongation by Endonucleolytic Cleavage of Nascent Transcripts.Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is pervasive in the human genome. However, the mechanisms controlling transcription at promoters and enhancers remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11), the catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex, regulates transcription at these loci through its endonuclease activity. Promoters of genes require INTS11 to cleave nascent transcripts associated with paused RNAPII and induce their premature termination in the proximity of the +1 nucleosome. The turnover of RNAPII permits the subsequent recruitment of an elongation-competent RNAPII complex, leading to productive elongation. In contrast, enhancers require INTS11 catalysis not to evict paused RNAPII but rather to terminate enhancer RNA transcription beyond the +1 nucleosome. These findings are supported by the differential occupancy of negative elongation factor (NELF), SPT5, and tyrosine-1-phosphorylated RNAPII. This study elucidates the role of Integrator in mediating transcriptional elongation at human promoters through the endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent transcripts and the dynamic turnover of RNAPII."	0

To further investigate this incompletely understood pathobiology, we characterize IL-13 effects on human airway epithelial cell cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing, finding that IL-13 generates a distinctive transcriptional state for each cell type. Specifically, we discover a mucus secretory program induced by IL-13 in all cell types which converts both mucus and defense secretory cells into a metaplastic state with emergent mucin production and secretion, while leading to ER stress and cell death in ciliated cells. The IL-13-remodeled epithelium secretes a pathologic, mucin-imbalanced, and innate immunity-depleted proteome that arrests mucociliary motion. Signatures of IL-13-induced cellular remodeling are mirrored by transcriptional signatures characteristic of the nasal airway epithelium within T2H versus T2-low asthmatic children. Our results reveal the epithelium-wide scope of T2H asthma and present candidate therapeutic targets for restoring normal epithelial function."	0
"32587092"	"High-speed atomic force microscopy directly visualizes conformational dynamics of the HIV Vif protein in complex with three host proteins.Vif (viral infectivity factor) is a protein that is essential for the replication of the HIV-1 virus. The key function of Vif is to disrupt the antiviral activity of host APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3) proteins, which mutate viral nucleic acids. Inside the cell, Vif binds to the host cell proteins Elongin-C, Elongin-B, and core-binding factor subunit β, forming a four-protein complex called VCBC. The structure of VCBC-Cullin5 has recently been solved by X-ray crystallography, and, using molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of VCBC have been characterized. Here, we applied time-lapse high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize the conformational changes of the VCBC complex. We determined the three most favorable conformations of this complex, which we identified as the triangle, dumbbell, and globular structures. Moreover, we characterized the dynamics of each of these structures. Our data revealed the very dynamic behavior of all of them, with the triangle and dumbbell structures being the most dynamic. These findings provide insight into the structure and dynamics of the VCBC complex and may support efforts to improve HIV treatment, because Vif is essential for virus survival in the cell."	0
"31402096"	"Bicoid-Dependent Activation of the Target Gene hunchback Requires a Two-Motif Sequence Code in a Specific Basal Promoter.In complex genetic loci, individual enhancers interact most often with specific basal promoters. Here we investigate the activation of the Bicoid target gene hunchback (hb), which contains two basal promoters (P1 and P2). Early in embryogenesis, P1 is silent, while P2 is strongly activated. In vivo deletion of P2 does not cause activation of P1, suggesting that P2 contains intrinsic sequence motifs required for activation. We show that a two-motif code (a Zelda binding site plus TATA) is required and sufficient for P2 activation. Zelda sites are present in the promoters of many embryonically expressed genes, but the combination of Zelda plus TATA does not seem to be a general code for early activation or Bicoid-specific activation per se. Because Zelda sites are also found in Bicoid-dependent enhancers, we propose that simultaneous binding to both enhancers and promoters independently synchronizes chromatin accessibility and facilitates correct enhancer-promoter interactions."	0
"31983508"	"Maintaining Iron Homeostasis Is the Key Role of Lysosomal Acidity for Cell Proliferation.The lysosome is an acidic multi-functional organelle with roles in macromolecular digestion, nutrient sensing, and signaling. However, why cells require acidic lysosomes to proliferate and which nutrients become limiting under lysosomal dysfunction are unclear. To address this, we performed CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens and identified cholesterol biosynthesis and iron uptake as essential metabolic pathways when lysosomal pH is altered. While cholesterol synthesis is only necessary, iron is both necessary and sufficient for cell proliferation under lysosomal dysfunction. Remarkably, iron supplementation restores cell proliferation under both pharmacologic and genetic-mediated lysosomal dysfunction. The rescue was independent of metabolic or signaling changes classically associated with increased lysosomal pH, uncoupling lysosomal function from cell proliferation. Finally, our experiments revealed that lysosomal dysfunction dramatically alters mitochondrial metabolism and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling due to iron depletion. Altogether, these findings identify iron homeostasis as the key function of lysosomal acidity for cell proliferation."	0
"32521277"	"Heterogeneous Habenular Neuronal Ensembles during Selection of Defensive Behaviors.Optimal selection of threat-driven defensive behaviors is paramount to an animal's survival. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a key neuronal hub coordinating behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. Yet, how individual LHb neurons represent defensive behaviors in response to threats remains unknown. Here, we show that in mice, a visual threat promotes distinct defensive behaviors, namely runaway (escape) and action-locking (immobile-like). Fiber photometry of bulk LHb neuronal activity in behaving animals reveals an increase and a decrease in calcium signal time-locked with runaway and action-locking, respectively. Imaging single-cell calcium dynamics across distinct threat-driven behaviors identify independently active LHb neuronal clusters. These clusters participate during specific time epochs of defensive behaviors. Decoding analysis of this neuronal activity reveals that some LHb clusters either predict the upcoming selection of the defensive action or represent the selected action. Thus, heterogeneous neuronal clusters in LHb predict or reflect the selection of distinct threat-driven defensive behaviors."	0

Although this regimen shortly improves symptoms in the short term, it also leads to more malignant disease in the long term. We describe a multilayered analysis ranging from chromatin to translation-integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and ribosome profiling-to understand how cisplatin confers (pre)malignant features by using a well-established ovarian cancer model of cisplatin exposure. This approach allows us to segregate the human transcriptome into gene modules representing distinct regulatory principles and to characterize that the most cisplatin-disrupted modules are associated with underlying events of super-enhancer plasticity. These events arise when cancer cells initiate without ultimately ending the program of drug-stimulated death. Using a PageRank-based algorithm, we predict super-enhancer regulator ISL1 as a driver of this plasticity and validate this prediction by using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB inhibition (CRISPRi) and CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 activation (CRISPRa) tools. Together, we propose that cisplatin reprograms cancer cells when inducing them to undergo near-to-death experiences."	0

While TOP2ccs are normally reversible, they can be ""trapped"" by chemotherapeutic drugs such as etoposide and subsequently converted into irreversible TOP2-linked DSBs. Here, we have quantified etoposide-induced trapping of TOP2ccs, their conversion into irreversible TOP2-linked DSBs, and their processing during DNA repair genome-wide, as a function of time. We find that while TOP2 chromatin localization and trapping is independent of transcription, it requires pre-existing binding of cohesin to DNA. In contrast, the conversion of trapped TOP2ccs to irreversible DSBs during DNA repair is accelerated 2-fold at transcribed loci relative to non-transcribed loci. This conversion is dependent on proteasomal degradation and TDP2 phosphodiesterase activity. Quantitative modeling shows that only two features of pre-existing chromatin structure-namely, cohesin binding and transcriptional activity-can be used to predict the kinetics of TOP2-induced DSBs."	0

Elimination of existing native host NPCs enables their replacement with donor NPCs, which can generate neo-nephrons. However, this system cannot be applied to human NPCs, because DT induces apoptosis in human cells. Therefore, the present study presents a transgenic mouse model for the ablation of NPCs using tamoxifen, which does not affect human cells. Using this system, we successfully regenerate interspecies neo-nephrons, which exhibit urine-producing abilities, from transplanted rat NPCs in a mouse host. Transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs results in differentiation into renal vesicles, which connect to the ureteric bud of the host.

Although LSD1 and JmjC domain-containing proteins have been identified as histone demethylases, enzymes for many histone methylation states or sites are still unknown. Here, we perform a screening of a cDNA library containing 2,500 nuclear proteins and identify hHR23A as a histone H4K20 demethylase. Overexpression of hHR23A reduces the levels of H4K20me1/2/3 in cells. In vitro, hHR23A specifically demethylates H4K20me1/2/3 and generates formaldehyde. The enzymatic activity requires Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate as cofactors and the UBA domains of hHR23A. hHR23B, a protein homologous to hHR23A, also demethylates H4K20me1/2/3 in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that hHR23A/B activate the transcription of coding genes by demethylating H4K20me1 and the transcription of repetitive elements by demethylating H4K20me3. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses demonstrate that an HxxxE motif in the UBA1 domain is crucial for iron binding and demethylase activity.

Although this pathological change plays a critical role in lung tissue injury and secondary infection, the molecular mechanism of IAV-induced damage to the alveolar barrier remains obscure. Here, we report that Gli1, a transcription factor in the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, is cross-activated by the MAP and PI3 kinase pathways in H1N1 virus (PR8)-infected A549 cells and in the lungs of H1N1 virus-infected mice. Gli1 activation induces Snail expression, which downregulates the expression of intercellular junction proteins, including E-cadherin, ZO-1, and Occludin, and increases paracellular permeability. Inhibition of the Shh pathway restores the levels of Snail and intercellular junction proteins in H1N1-infected cells. Our study suggests that Gli1 activation plays an important role in disrupting the intercellular junctions and in promoting the pathogenesis of H1N1 virus infections."	0
"32209462"	"Transcription Factor Binding to Replicated DNA.Genome replication perturbs the DNA regulatory environment by displacing DNA-bound proteins, replacing nucleosomes, and introducing dosage imbalance between regions replicating at different S-phase stages. Recently, we showed that these effects are integrated to maintain transcription homeostasis: replicated genes increase in dosage, but their expression remains stable due to replication-dependent epigenetic changes that suppress transcription. Here, we examine whether reduced transcription from replicated DNA results from limited accessibility to regulatory factors by measuring the time-resolved binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA during S phase in budding yeast. We show that the Pol II binding pattern is largely insensitive to DNA dosage, indicating limited binding to replicated DNA. In contrast, binding of three TFs (Reb1, Abf1, and Rap1) to DNA increases with the increasing DNA dosage. We conclude that the replication-specific chromatin environment remains accessible to regulatory factors but suppresses RNA polymerase recruitment."	0
"32320668"	"Wdr47 Controls Neuronal Polarization through the Camsap Family Microtubule Minus-End-Binding Proteins.Neurons require proper polarization for precise positioning and axon-dendrite formation. Their intrinsic regulators and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that Wdr47 is a key polarization regulator. Wdr47-deficient newborn mice die of suffocation due to central nervous system defects including axonal tracts agenesis and slowed radial migration. Wdr47 deficiency represses the multipolar-bipolar transition of cortical neurons, reduces neurite tip-directed microtubule dynamics, and causes multi-axon formation. Overexpression of Wdr47 in wild-type neurons inhibits axon specification and neutralizes Taxol-induced neurite overgrowth and axon overproduction. Wdr47 interacts with the Camsap family of microtubule minus-end-binding proteins; associates with microtubules through Camsap3, whose gene disruption also causes multi-axons; and promotes Camsap3 accumulation in neurites of unpolarized neurons. Furthermore, Camsap overexpression rescues the polarization defects of Wdr47-deficient neurons. Our results indicate that Wdr47 facilitates proper neurite remodeling through Camsaps to fine-tune regional microtubule dynamics and organization during early stages of neuronal polarization."	0

Unbiased detection through proximity labeling of transient protein interactions in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extract identified the dimeric histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) as an interactor of substrate-bound Cas9. FACT is both necessary and sufficient to displace dCas9, and FACT immunodepletion converts Cas9's activity from multi-turnover to single turnover. In human cells, FACT depletion extends dCas9 residence times, delays genome editing, and alters the balance between indel formation and homology-directed repair. FACT knockdown also increases epigenetic marking by dCas9-based transcriptional effectors with a concomitant enhancement of transcriptional modulation. FACT thus shapes the intrinsic cellular response to Cas9-based genome manipulation most likely by determining Cas9 residence times."	0

We raised rat pups in different spectro-temporal noise statistics during their auditory critical period. As adults, they showed enhanced behavioral performance in detecting vocalizations in noise. Concomitantly, encoding of vocalizations in noise in the primary auditory cortex improves with noise-rearing. Significantly, spectro-temporal modulation plasticity shifts cortical preferences away from the exposed noise statistics, thus reducing noise interference with the foreground sound representation. Auditory cortical plasticity shapes receptive field preferences to optimally extract foreground information in noisy environments during noise-rearing. Early noise exposure induces cortical circuits to implement efficient coding in the joint spectral and temporal modulation domain."	0

"32697992"	"Pseudo-RNA-Binding Domains Mediate RNA Structure Specificity in Upstream of N-Ras.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) commonly feature multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs), which provide these proteins with a modular architecture. Accumulating evidence supports that RBP architectural modularity and adaptability define the specificity of their interactions with RNA. However, how multiple RBDs recognize their cognate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences in concert remains poorly understood. Here, we use Upstream of N-Ras (Unr) as a model system to address this question. Although reported to contain five ssRNA-binding cold-shock domains (CSDs), we demonstrate that Unr includes an additional four CSDs that do not bind RNA (pseudo-RBDs) but are involved in mediating RNA tertiary structure specificity by reducing the conformational heterogeneity of Unr. Disrupting the interactions between canonical and non-canonical CSDs impacts RNA binding, Unr-mediated translation regulation, and the Unr-dependent RNA interactome. Taken together, our studies reveal a new paradigm in protein-RNA recognition, where interactions between RBDs and pseudo-RBDs select RNA tertiary structures, influence RNP assembly, and define target specificity."	0

"32187553"	"FGFR1 Oncogenic Activation Reveals an Alternative Cell of Origin of SCLC in Rb1/p53 Mice.Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is frequently amplified in human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), but its contribution to SCLC and other lung tumors has remained elusive. Here, we assess the tumorigenic capacity of constitutive-active FGFR1 (FGFR1<sup>K656E</sup>) with concomitant RB and P53 depletion in mouse lung. Our results reveal a context-dependent effect of FGFR1<sup>K656E</sup>: it impairs SCLC development from CGRP<sup>POS</sup> neuroendocrine (NE) cells, which are considered the major cell of origin of SCLC, whereas it promotes SCLC and low-grade NE bronchial lesions from tracheobronchial-basal cells. Moreover, FGFR1<sup>K656E</sup> induces lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) from most lung cell compartments. However, its expression is not sustained in LADC originating from CGRP<sup>POS</sup> cells. Therefore, cell context and tumor stage should be taken into account when considering FGFR1 inhibition as a therapeutic option."	0

Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses. Our studies reveal a role for PD-1 as an integrator of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell signals that promotes CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation and suggest PD-1 continues to fine-tune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after they migrate into non-lymphoid tissues. These findings have important implications for PD-1-based immunotherapy, in which PD-1 inhibition may influence memory responses in patients."	0
"30472189"	"Nucleosome Turnover Regulates Histone Methylation Patterns over the Genome.Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence."	0
"31422874"	"Naa10p Inhibits Beige Adipocyte-Mediated Thermogenesis through N-α-acetylation of Pgc1α.Diet-induced obesity can be caused by impaired thermogenesis of beige adipocytes, the brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT). Promoting brown-like features in WAT has been an attractive therapeutic approach for obesity. However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p) catalyzes N-α-acetylation of nascent proteins, and overexpression of human Naa10p is linked to cancer development. Here, we report that both conventional and adipose-specific Naa10p deletions in mice result in increased energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and beige adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Naa10p acetylates the N terminus of Pgc1α, which prevents Pgc1α from interacting with Pparγ to activate key genes, such as Ucp1, involved in beige adipocyte function. Consistently, fat tissues of obese human individuals show higher NAA10 expression. Thus, Naa10p-mediated N-terminal acetylation of Pgc1α downregulates thermogenic gene expression, making inhibition of Naa10p enzymatic activity a potential strategy for treating obesity."	1

"31047795"	"Metabolomics-Driven Exploration of the Chemical Drug Space to Predict Combination Antimicrobial Therapies.Alternative to the conventional search for single-target, single-compound treatments, combination therapies can open entirely new opportunities to fight antibiotic resistance. However, combinatorial complexity prohibits experimental testing of drug combinations on a large scale, and methods to rationally design combination therapies are lagging behind. Here, we developed a combined experimental-computational approach to predict drug-drug interactions using high-throughput metabolomics. The approach was tested on 1,279 pharmacologically diverse drugs applied to the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Combining our metabolic profiling of drug response with previously generated metabolic and chemogenomic profiles of 3,807 single-gene deletion strains revealed an unexpectedly large space of inhibited gene functions and enabled rational design of drug combinations. This approach is applicable to other therapeutic areas and can unveil unprecedented insights into drug tolerance, side effects, and repurposing.

"30639240"	"Mechanistic Insights into the cis- and trans-Acting DNase Activities of Cas12a.CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) is an RNA-guided DNA-cutting nuclease that has been repurposed for genome editing. Upon target DNA binding, Cas12a cleaves both the target DNA in cis and non-target single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in trans. To elucidate the molecular basis for both DNase cleavage modes, we performed structural and biochemical studies on Francisella novicida Cas12a. We show that guide RNA-target strand DNA hybridization conformationally activates Cas12a, triggering its trans-acting, non-specific, single-stranded DNase activity. In turn, cis cleavage of double-stranded DNA targets is a result of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent DNA duplex unwinding, electrostatic stabilization of the displaced non-target DNA strand, and ordered sequential cleavage of the non-target and target DNA strands. Cas12a releases the PAM-distal DNA cleavage product and remains bound to the PAM-proximal DNA cleavage product in a catalytically competent, trans-active state. Together, these results provide a revised model for the molecular mechanisms of both the cis- and the trans-acting DNase activities of Cas12a enzymes, enabling their further exploitation as genome editing tools."	0
"31519522"	"Elongation Factor TFIIS Prevents Transcription Stress and R-Loop Accumulation to Maintain Genome Stability.Although correlations between RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription stress, R-loops, and genome instability have been established, the mechanisms underlying these connections remain poorly understood. Here, we used a mutant version of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS (TFIIS<sub>mut</sub>), aiming to specifically induce increased levels of RNAPII pausing, arrest, and/or backtracking in human cells. Indeed, TFIIS<sub>mut</sub> expression results in slower elongation rates, relative depletion of polymerases from the end of genes, and increased levels of stopped RNAPII; it affects mRNA splicing and termination as well. Remarkably, TFIIS<sub>mut</sub> expression also dramatically increases R-loops, which may form at the anterior end of backtracked RNAPII and trigger genome instability, including DNA strand breaks. These results shed light on the relationship between transcription stress and R-loops and suggest that different classes of R-loops may exist, potentially with distinct consequences for genome stability."	0
"32268096"	"Structural Insights into the Mammalian Late-Stage Initiation Complexes.In higher eukaryotes, the mRNA sequence in the direct vicinity of the start codon, called the Kozak sequence (CRCCaugG, where R is a purine), is known to influence the rate of the initiation process. However, the molecular basis underlying its role remains poorly understood. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of mammalian late-stage 48S initiation complexes (LS48S ICs) in the presence of two different native mRNA sequences, β-globin and histone 4, at overall resolution of 3 and 3.5 Å, respectively. Our high-resolution structures unravel key interactions from the mRNA to eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs): 1A, 2, 3, 18S rRNA, and several 40S ribosomal proteins. In addition, we are able to study the structural role of ABCE1 in the formation of native 48S ICs. Our results reveal a comprehensive map of ribosome/eIF-mRNA and ribosome/eIF-tRNA interactions and suggest the impact of mRNA sequence on the structure of the LS48S IC."	0

Here we report structural and functional studies of human maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor suppressor lncRNA that modulates the p53 response. We found that, in an evolutionary conserved region of MEG3, two distal motifs interact by base complementarity to form alternative, mutually exclusive pseudoknot structures (""kissing loops""). Mutations that disrupt these interactions impair MEG3-dependent p53 stimulation in vivo and disrupt MEG3 folding in vitro. These findings provide mechanistic insights into regulation of the p53 pathway by MEG3 and reveal how conserved motifs of tertiary structure can regulate lncRNA biological function."	0
"32187537"	"Biased Connectivity of Brain-wide Inputs to Ventral Subiculum Output Neurons.The ventral subiculum (vS) of the mouse hippocampus coordinates diverse behaviors through heterogeneous populations of pyramidal neurons that project to multiple distinct downstream regions. Each of these populations of neurons is proposed to integrate a unique combination of thousands of local and long-range synaptic inputs, but the extent to which this occurs remains unknown. To address this, we employ monosynaptic rabies tracing to study the input-output relationship of vS neurons. Analysis of brain-wide inputs reveals quantitative input differences that could be explained by a combination of both the identity of the downstream target and the spatial location of the postsynaptic neurons within vS. These results support a model of combined topographical and output-defined connectivity of vS inputs. Overall, we reveal prominent heterogeneity in brain-wide inputs to the vS parallel output circuitry, providing a basis for the selective control of individual projections during behavior."	0

Here, through a mini-screen, we identified the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 2 (ORP2) as a novel mediator of selective cholesterol delivery to the PM. Interestingly, ORP2-mediated enrichment of PM cholesterol was coupled with the removal of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) from the PM. ORP2 overexpression or deficiency impacted the levels of PM cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and ORP2 efficiently transferred both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>in vitro. We determined the structure of ORP2 in complex with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at 2.7 Å resolution. ORP2 formed a stable tetramer in the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and tetramerization was required for ORP2 to transfer PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Our results identify a novel pathway for cholesterol delivery to the PM and establish ORP2 as a key regulator of both cholesterol and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> of the PM."	0
"32553160"	"Corrination of a GLP-1 Receptor Agonist for Glycemic Control without Emesis.Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus often produce nausea, vomiting, and in some patients, undesired anorexia. Notably, these behavioral effects are caused by direct central GLP-1R activation. Herein, we describe the creation of a GLP-1R agonist conjugate with modified brain penetrance that enhances GLP-1R-mediated glycemic control without inducing vomiting. Covalent attachment of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex4) to dicyanocobinamide (Cbi), a corrin ring containing precursor of vitamin B12, produces a ""corrinated"" Ex4 construct (Cbi-Ex4). Data collected in the musk shrew (Suncus murinus), an emetic mammal, reveal beneficial effects of Cbi-Ex4 relative to Ex4, as evidenced by improvements in glycemic responses in glucose tolerance tests and a profound reduction of emetic events. Our findings highlight the potential for clinical use of Cbi-Ex4 for millions of patients seeking improved glycemic control without common side effects (e.g., emesis) characteristic of current GLP-1 therapeutics."	0

Pharmacological tools specifically targeting TMEM16 CaPLSases are urgently needed to understand these novel membrane transporters and their contributions to health and disease. Tannic acid (TA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were recently reported as promising TMEM16F CaPLSase inhibitors. However, our present study shows that TA and EGCG do not inhibit the phospholipid-scrambling or ion conduction activities of the dual-functional TMEM16F. Instead, we found that TA and EGCG mainly acted as fluorescence quenchers that rapidly suppress the fluorophores conjugated to annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-binding probe commonly used to report on TMEM16 CaPLSase activity. These data demonstrate the false positive effects of TA and EGCG on inhibiting TMEM16F phospholipid scrambling and discourage the use of these polyphenols as CaPLSase inhibitors. Appropriate controls as well as a combination of both fluorescence imaging and electrophysiological validation are necessary in future endeavors to develop TMEM16 CaPLSase inhibitors."	0
"30954403"	"The Phospho-Code Determining Circadian Feedback Loop Closure and Output in Neurospora.In the negative feedback loop driving fungal and animal circadian oscillators, negative elements (FREQUENCY [FRQ], PERIODS [PERs], and CRYPTOCHROMES [CRYs]) are understood to inhibit their own expression, in part by promoting the phosphorylation of their heterodimeric transcriptional activators (e.g., White Collar-1 [WC-1]-WC-2 [White Collar complex; WCC] and BMAL1/Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput [CLOCK]). However, correlations between heterodimer activity and phosphorylation are weak, contradictions exist, and mechanistic details are almost wholly lacking. We report mapping of 80 phosphosites on WC-1 and 15 on WC-2 and elucidation of the time-of-day-specific code, requiring both a group of phosphoevents on WC-1 and two distinct clusters on WC-2, that governs circadian repression, leading to feedback loop closure. Combinatorial control via phosphorylation also governs rhythmic WCC binding to the promoters of clock-controlled genes mediating the essential first step in circadian output, a group encoding both transcription factors and signaling proteins. These data provide a basic mechanistic understanding for fundamental events underlying circadian negative feedback and output, key aspects of circadian biology."	0
"31809743"	"The Integrator Complex Attenuates Promoter-Proximal Transcription at Protein-Coding Genes.The transition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from initiation to productive elongation is a central, regulated step in metazoan gene expression. At many genes, Pol II pauses stably in early elongation, remaining engaged with the 25- to 60-nt-long nascent RNA for many minutes while awaiting signals for release into the gene body. However, 15%-20% of genes display highly unstable promoter Pol II, suggesting that paused polymerase might dissociate from template DNA at these promoters and release a short, non-productive mRNA. Here, we report that paused Pol II can be actively destabilized by the Integrator complex. Specifically, we present evidence that Integrator utilizes its RNA endonuclease activity to cleave nascent RNA and drive termination of paused Pol II. These findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism of metazoan gene repression, akin to bacterial transcription attenuation, wherein promoter-proximal Pol II is prevented from entering productive elongation through factor-regulated termination."	0
"32611771"	"TOR complex 2 (TORC2) signaling and the ESCRT machinery cooperate in the protection of plasma membrane integrity in yeast.The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) mediate evolutionarily conserved membrane remodeling processes. Here, we used budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) to explore how the ESCRT machinery contributes to plasma membrane (PM) homeostasis. We found that in response to reduced membrane tension and inhibition of TOR complex 2 (TORC2), ESCRT-III/Vps4 assemblies form at the PM and help maintain membrane integrity. In turn, the growth of ESCRT mutants strongly depended on TORC2-mediated homeostatic regulation of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism. This was caused by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of Orm2, a repressor of SL biosynthesis. Calcineurin activity impaired Orm2 export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thereby hampered its subsequent endosome and Golgi-associated degradation (EGAD). The ensuing accumulation of Orm2 at the ER in ESCRT mutants necessitated TORC2 signaling through its downstream kinase Ypk1, which repressed Orm2 and prevented a detrimental imbalance of SL metabolism. Our findings reveal compensatory cross-talk between the ESCRT machinery, calcineurin/TORC2 signaling, and the EGAD pathway important for the regulation of SL biosynthesis and the maintenance of PM homeostasis."	0
"32375047"	"Interstitial Cell Remodeling Promotes Aberrant Adipogenesis in Dystrophic Muscles.Fibrosis and fat replacement in skeletal muscle are major complications that lead to a loss of mobility in chronic muscle disorders, such as muscular dystrophy. However, the in vivo properties of adipogenic stem and precursor cells remain unclear, mainly due to the high cell heterogeneity in skeletal muscles. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to decomplexify interstitial cell populations in healthy and dystrophic skeletal muscles. We identify an interstitial CD142-positive cell population in mice and humans that is responsible for the inhibition of adipogenesis through GDF10 secretion. Furthermore, we show that the interstitial cell composition is completely altered in muscular dystrophy, with a near absence of CD142-positive cells. The identification of these adipo-regulatory cells in the skeletal muscle aids our understanding of the aberrant fat deposition in muscular dystrophy, paving the way for treatments that could counteract degeneration in patients with muscular dystrophy."	0
"31968256"	"Cohesin Disrupts Polycomb-Dependent Chromosome Interactions in Embryonic Stem Cells.How chromosome organization is related to genome function remains poorly understood. Cohesin, loop extrusion, and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) have been proposed to create topologically associating domains (TADs) to regulate gene expression. Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find, as in other cell types, that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate A/B compartmentalization. However, in the absence of cohesin, we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system and are dependent on PRC1. Importantly, we discover that cohesin counteracts these polycomb-dependent interactions, but not interactions between super-enhancers. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and insulation and appears to modulate gene repression by the polycomb system. Therefore, we discover that cohesin disrupts polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions to modulate gene expression in embryonic stem cells."	0

Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation is associated with heterochromatin and gene repression during cell-fate change<sup>5</sup>, whereas histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation marks active gene promoters<sup>6</sup>. Mature oocytes are transcriptionally quiescent and possess remarkably broad domains of H3K4me3 (bdH3K4me3)<sup>1,2</sup>. It is unknown which factors contribute to the maintenance of the bdH3K4me3 landscape. Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) demethylates H3K9me3 at promoters marked by H3K4me3 in actively transcribing somatic cells<sup>7</sup>. Here, we report that KDM4A-mediated H3K9me3 demethylation at bdH3K4me3 in oocytes is crucial for normal pre-implantation development and zygotic genome activation after fertilization. The loss of KDM4A in oocytes causes aberrant H3K9me3 spreading over bdH3K4me3, resulting in insufficient transcriptional activation of genes, endogenous retroviral elements and chimeric transcripts initiated from long terminal repeats during zygotic genome activation. The catalytic activity of KDM4A is essential for normal epigenetic reprogramming and pre-implantation development. Hence, KDM4A plays a crucial role in preserving the maternal epigenome integrity required for proper zygotic genome activation and transfer of developmental control to the embryo."	0
"32075735"	"Palmitate Is Increased in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Humans with Obesity and Induces Memory Impairment in Mice via Pro-inflammatory TNF-α.Obesity has been associated with cognitive decline, atrophy of brain regions related to learning and memory, and higher risk of developing dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurological alterations are still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid present at high amounts in fat-rich diets, in the brain. Palmitate is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of overweight and obese patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In mice, intracerebroventricular infusion of palmitate impairs synaptic plasticity and memory. Palmitate induces astroglial and microglial activation in the mouse hippocampus, and its deleterious impact is mediated by microglia-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling. Our results establish that obesity is associated with increases in CSF palmitate. By defining a pro-inflammatory mechanism by which abnormal levels of palmitate in the brain impair memory, the results further suggest that anti-inflammatory strategies may attenuate memory impairment in obesity."	0
"32029452"	"PARPs and ADP-ribosylation in RNA biology: from RNA expression and processing to protein translation and proteostasis.ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) is a posttranslational modification of proteins discovered nearly six decades ago, but many important questions remain regarding its molecular functions and biological roles, as well as the activity of the ADP-ribose (ADPR) transferase enzymes (PARP family members) that catalyze it. Growing evidence indicates that PARP-mediated ADPRylation events are key regulators of the protein biosynthetic pathway, leading from rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA synthesis, processing, and translation. In this review we describe the role of PARP proteins and ADPRylation in all facets of this pathway. PARP-1 and its enzymatic activity are key regulators of rDNA transcription, which is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. An emerging role of PARPs in alternative splicing of mRNAs, as well as direct ADPRylation of mRNAs, highlight the role of PARP members in RNA processing. Furthermore, PARP activity, stimulated by cellular stresses, such as viral infections and ER stress, leads to the regulation of mRNA stability and protein synthesis through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Dysregulation of PARP activity in these processes can promote disease states. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of PARP family members and ADPRylation in gene regulation, mRNA processing, and protein abundance. Future studies in these areas will yield new insights into the fundamental mechanisms and a broader utility for PARP-targeted therapeutic agents."	0

While the topological characteristics of the FRC network have been elaborated, the network properties of the micro-tubular conduit system generated by FRCs, which drains lymph fluid through a pipeline-like system to distribute small molecules and antigens, has remained unexplored. Here, we quantify the crucial 3D morphometric parameters and determine the topological properties governing the structural organization of the intertwined networks. We find that the conduit system exhibits lesser small-worldness and lower resilience to perturbation compared to the FRC network, while the robust topological organization of both networks is maintained in a lymphotoxin-β-receptor-independent manner.

"32601371"	"Heterochromatin establishment during early mammalian development is regulated by pericentromeric RNA and characterized by non-repressive H3K9me3.Following fertilization in mammals, the gametes are reprogrammed to create a totipotent zygote, a process that involves de novo establishment of chromatin domains. A major feature occurring during preimplantation development is the dramatic remodelling of constitutive heterochromatin, although the functional relevance of this is unknown. Here, we show that heterochromatin establishment relies on the stepwise expression and regulated activity of SUV39H enzymes. Enforcing precocious acquisition of constitutive heterochromatin results in compromised development and epigenetic reprogramming, which demonstrates that heterochromatin remodelling is essential for natural reprogramming at fertilization. We find that de novo H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) in the paternal pronucleus after fertilization is catalysed by SUV39H2 and that pericentromeric RNAs inhibit SUV39H2 activity and reduce H3K9me3. De novo H3K9me3 is initially non-repressive for gene expression, but instead bookmarks promoters for compaction. Overall, we uncover the functional importance for the restricted transmission of constitutive heterochromatin during reprogramming and a non-repressive role for H3K9me3."	0

Using intersectional genetic techniques, we find that CeS neurons constitute a small minority of excitatory neurons in the fastigial and interpositus deep cerebellar nuclei, target pre-motor circuits in the ventral spinal cord and the brain, and control distinct aspects of movement. CeS neurons that project to the ipsilateral cervical cord are required for skilled forelimb performance, while CeS neurons that project to the contralateral cervical cord are involved in skilled locomotor learning.

"32451439"	"ROCK-mediated selective activation of PERK signalling causes fibroblast reprogramming and tumour progression through a CRELD2-dependent mechanism.It is well accepted that cancers co-opt the microenvironment for their growth. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer-microenvironment interactions are still poorly defined. Here, we show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the mammary tumour epithelium selectively actuates protein-kinase-R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), causing the recruitment and persistent education of tumour-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are part of the cancer microenvironment. An analysis of tumours from patients and mice reveals that cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (CRELD2) is the paracrine factor that underlies PERK-mediated CAF education downstream of ROCK. We find that CRELD2 is regulated by PERK-regulated ATF4, and depleting CRELD2 suppressed tumour progression, demonstrating that the paracrine ROCK-PERK-ATF4-CRELD2 axis promotes the progression of breast cancer, with implications for cancer therapy."	1
"32303635"	"Transcriptome profiling and protease inhibition experiments identify proteases that activate H3N2 influenza A and influenza B viruses in murine airways.Cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is essential for virus infectivity. HA of most influenza A and B (IAV/IBV) viruses is cleaved at a monobasic motif by trypsin-like proteases. Previous studies have reported that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for activation of H7N9 and H1N1pdm IAV in mice but that H3N2 IAV and IBV activation is independent of TMPRSS2 and carried out by as-yet-undetermined protease(s). Here, to identify additional H3 IAV- and IBV-activating proteases, we used RNA-Seq to investigate the protease repertoire of murine lower airway tissues, primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs), and the mouse lung cell line MLE-15. Among 13 candidates identified, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13, hepsin, and prostasin activated H3 and IBV HA <i>in vitro</i> IBV activation and replication was reduced in AECIIs from <i>Tmprss2/Tmprss4</i>-deficient mice compared with WT or Tmprss2-deficient mice, indicating that murine TMPRSS4 is involved in IBV activation. Multicycle replication of H3N2 IAV and IBV in AECIIs of <i>Tmprss2/Tmprss4</i>-deficient mice varied in sensitivity to protease inhibitors, indicating that different, but overlapping, sets of murine proteases facilitate H3 and IBV HA cleavages. Interestingly, human hepsin and prostasin orthologs did not activate H3, but they did activate IBV HA <i>in vitro</i> Our results indicate that TMPRSS4 is an IBV-activating protease in murine AECIIs and suggest that TMPRSS13, hepsin, and prostasin cleave H3 and IBV HA in mice. They further show that hepsin and prostasin orthologs might contribute to the differences observed in TMPRSS2-independent activation of H3 in murine and human airways."	0
"32320646"	"Inducible Degradation of the Human SMC5/6 Complex Reveals an Essential Role Only during Interphase.The cohesin- and condensin-related SMC5/6 complex has largely been studied in the context of DNA repair. Nevertheless, SMC5/6 has an undefined essential function even in the absence of cellular stress. Through the use of an auxin-inducible degradation system for rapidly depleting subunits of the SMC5/6 complex, we show that SMC5/6 is essential for viability in cancer-derived and normal human cells. Impairment of SMC5/6 function is associated with spontaneous induction of DNA damage, p53 activation, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence, as well as an increased frequency of various mitotic chromosome segregation abnormalities. However, we show that this chromosome missegregation is apparent only when SMC5/6 function is impaired during the preceding S and G2 phases. In contrast, degradation of SMC5/6 immediately prior to mitotic entry has little or no impact on the fidelity of chromosome segregation, highlighting the importance of the complex during interphase in order to ensure faithful sister chromatid disjunction."	0
"31919190"	"Hap2-Ino80-facilitated transcription promotes de novo establishment of CENP-A chromatin.Centromeres are maintained epigenetically by the presence of CENP-A, an evolutionarily conserved histone H3 variant, which directs kinetochore assembly and hence centromere function. To identify factors that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin, we affinity-selected solubilized fission yeast CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin. All subunits of the Ino80 complex were enriched, including the auxiliary subunit Hap2. Chromatin association of Hap2 is Ies4-dependent. In addition to a role in maintenance of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin integrity at endogenous centromeres, Hap2 is required for de novo assembly of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin on naïve centromere DNA and promotes H3 turnover on centromere regions and other loci prone to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> deposition. Prior to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin assembly, Hap2 facilitates transcription from centromere DNA. These analyses suggest that Hap2-Ino80 destabilizes H3 nucleosomes on centromere DNA through transcription-coupled histone H3 turnover, driving the replacement of resident H3 nucleosomes with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes. These inherent properties define centromere DNA by directing a program that mediates CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> assembly on appropriate sequences."	0

Here, we report that BMP4 reconfigures the nuclear architecture during the primed-to-naive transition (PNT). We first established a BMP4-driven PNT and show that BMP4 orchestrates the chromatin accessibility dynamics during PNT. Among the loci opened early by BMP4, we identified Zbtb7a and Zbtb7b (Zbtb7a/b) as targets that drive PNT. ZBTB7A/B in turn facilitate the opening of naive pluripotent chromatin loci and the activation of nearby genes. Mechanistically, ZBTB7A not only binds to chromatin loci near to the genes that are activated, but also strategically occupies those that are silenced, consistent with a role of BMP4 in both activating and suppressing gene expression during PNT at the chromatin level. Our results reveal a previously unknown function of BMP4 in regulating nuclear architecture and link its targets ZBTB7A/B to chromatin remodelling and pluripotent fate control."	0

Bacteriophages have in turn evolved inhibitory ""anti-CRISPR"" (Acr) proteins, including six inhibitors (AcrIIA1-AcrIIA6) that can block DNA cutting and genome editing by type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes. We show here that AcrIIA2 and its more potent homolog, AcrIIA2b, prevent Cas9 binding to DNA by occluding protein residues required for DNA binding. Cryo-EM-determined structures of AcrIIA2 or AcrIIA2b bound to S. pyogenes Cas9 reveal a mode of competitive inhibition of DNA binding that is distinct from other known Acrs. Differences in the temperature dependence of Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA2b arise from differences in both inhibitor structure and the local inhibitor-binding environment on Cas9. These findings expand the natural toolbox for regulating CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing temporally, spatially, and conditionally."	0
"31968242"	"Modulation of Coordinated Activity across Cortical Layers by Plasticity of Inhibitory Synapses.In the neocortex, synaptic inhibition shapes all forms of spontaneous and sensory evoked activity. Importantly, inhibitory transmission is highly plastic, but the functional role of inhibitory synaptic plasticity is unknown. In the mouse barrel cortex, activation of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) elicits strong feedforward inhibition (FFI) onto L5 PNs. We find that FFI involving parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells is strongly potentiated by postsynaptic PN burst firing. FFI plasticity modifies the PN excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio, strongly modulates PN gain, and alters information transfer across cortical layers. Moreover, our LTPi-inducing protocol modifies firing of L5 PNs and alters the temporal association of PN spikes to γ-oscillations both in vitro and in vivo. All of these effects are captured by unbalancing the E/I ratio in a feedforward inhibition circuit model. Altogether, our results indicate that activity-dependent modulation of perisomatic inhibitory strength effectively influences the participation of single principal cortical neurons to cognition-relevant network activity."	0
"32330457"	"Threonine ADP-Ribosylation of Ubiquitin by a Bacterial Effector Family Blocks Host Ubiquitination.Ubiquitination is essential for numerous eukaryotic cellular processes. Here, we show that the type III effector CteC from Chromobacterium violaceum functions as an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase that specifically modifies ubiquitin via threonine ADP-ribosylation on residue T66. The covalent modification prevents the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, which inhibits subsequent ubiquitin activation by E2 and E3 enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade and leads to the shutdown of polyubiquitin synthesis in host cells. This unique modification also causes dysfunction of polyubiquitin chains in cells, thereby blocking host ubiquitin signaling. The disruption of host ubiquitination by CteC plays a crucial role in C. violaceum colonization in mice during infection. CteC represents a family of effector proteins in pathogens of hosts from different kingdoms. All the members of this family specifically ADP-ribosylate ubiquitin. The action of CteC reveals a new mechanism for interfering with host ubiquitination by pathogens."	0
"31932165"	"HORMA Domain Proteins and a Trip13-like ATPase Regulate Bacterial cGAS-like Enzymes to Mediate Bacteriophage Immunity.Bacteria are continually challenged by foreign invaders, including bacteriophages, and have evolved a variety of defenses against these invaders. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical mechanisms of a bacteriophage immunity pathway found in a broad array of bacteria, including E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathway uses eukaryotic-like HORMA domain proteins that recognize specific peptides, then bind and activate a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) to generate a cyclic triadenylate (cAAA) second messenger; cAAA in turn activates an endonuclease effector, NucC. Signaling is attenuated by a homolog of the AAA+ ATPase Pch2/TRIP13, which binds and disassembles the active HORMA-CD-NTase complex. When expressed in non-pathogenic E. coli, this pathway confers immunity against bacteriophage λ through an abortive infection mechanism. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense pathway integrating a cGAS-like nucleotidyltransferase with HORMA domain proteins for threat sensing through protein detection and negative regulation by a Trip13 ATPase."	0
"31757755"	"A Non-amyloid Prion Particle that Activates a Heritable Gene Expression Program.Spatiotemporal gene regulation is often driven by RNA-binding proteins that harbor long intrinsically disordered regions in addition to folded RNA-binding domains. We report that the disordered region of the evolutionarily ancient developmental regulator Vts1/Smaug drives self-assembly into gel-like condensates. These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid, yet they are infectious, allowing them to act as a protein-based epigenetic element: a prion [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG<sup>+</sup>]. Our data establish that non-amyloid self-assembly of RNA-binding proteins can drive a form of epigenetics beyond the chromosome, instilling adaptive gene expression programs that are heritable over long biological timescales."	0
"32738194"	"Quality Control of ER Membrane Proteins by the RNF185/Membralin Ubiquitin Ligase Complex.Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although ERAD components involved in degradation of luminal substrates are well characterized, much less is known about quality control of membrane proteins. Here, we analyzed the degradation pathways of two short-lived ER membrane model proteins in mammalian cells. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide library screen, we identified an ERAD branch required for quality control of a subset of membrane proteins. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches, we showed that this ERAD branch is defined by an ER membrane complex consisting of the ubiquitin ligase RNF185, the ubiquitin-like domain containing proteins TMUB1/2 and TMEM259/Membralin, a poorly characterized protein. This complex cooperates with cytosolic ubiquitin ligase UBE3C and p97 ATPase in degrading their membrane substrates. Our data reveal that ERAD branches have remarkable specificity for their membrane substrates, suggesting that multiple, perhaps combinatorial, determinants are involved in substrate selection."	1

"31914401"	"Functional Regeneration of the Sensory Root via Axonal Invasion.Regeneration following spinal root avulsion is broadly unsuccessful despite the regenerative capacity of other PNS-located nerves. By combining focal laser lesioning to model root avulsion in zebrafish, time-lapse imaging, and transgenesis, we identify that regenerating DRG neurons fail to recapitulate developmental paradigms of actin-based invasion after injury. We demonstrate that inducing actin reorganization into invasive components via pharmacological and genetic approaches in the regenerating axon can rescue sensory axon spinal cord entry. Cell-autonomous induction of invasion components using constitutively active Src induces DRG axon regeneration, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism can be activated to drive regeneration. Furthermore, analyses of neuronal activity and animal behavior show restoration of sensory circuit activity and behavior upon stimulating axons to re-enter the spinal cord via invasion. Altogether, our data identify induction of invasive components as sufficient for functional sensory root regeneration after injury."	0
"32238450"	"Structure and mechanism of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery.RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes and many noncoding RNAs in eukaryotic genomes. Although Pol II is a complex, 12-subunit enzyme, it lacks the ability to initiate transcription and cannot consistently transcribe through long DNA sequences. To execute these essential functions, an array of proteins and protein complexes interact with Pol II to regulate its activity. In this review, we detail the structure and mechanism of over a dozen factors that govern Pol II initiation (e.g., TFIID, TFIIH, and Mediator), pausing, and elongation (e.g., DSIF, NELF, PAF, and P-TEFb). The structural basis for Pol II transcription regulation has advanced rapidly in the past decade, largely due to technological innovations in cryoelectron microscopy. Here, we summarize a wealth of structural and functional data that have enabled a deeper understanding of Pol II transcription mechanisms; we also highlight mechanistic questions that remain unanswered or controversial."	0
"32049000"	"Partial Inhibition of RNA Polymerase I Promotes Animal Health and Longevity.Health and survival in old age can be improved by changes in gene expression. RNA polymerase (Pol) I is the essential, conserved enzyme whose task is to generate the pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA). We find that reducing the levels of Pol I activity is sufficient to extend lifespan in the fruit fly. This effect can be recapitulated by partial, adult-restricted inhibition, with both enterocytes and stem cells of the adult midgut emerging as important cell types. In stem cells, Pol I appears to act in the same longevity pathway as Pol III, implicating rRNA synthesis in these cells as the key lifespan determinant. Importantly, reduction in Pol I activity delays broad, age-related impairment and pathology, improving the function of diverse organ systems. Hence, our study shows that Pol I activity in the adult drives systemic, age-related decline in animal health and anticipates mortality."	0

We induce CBA-specific, IL-35-producing T regulatory (Treg) cells in Treg<sup>Ebi3WT</sup> C57BL/6 reporter mice and identify IL-35 producers by expression of Ebi3<sup>TdTom</sup> gene reporter plus Ebi3 and p35 proteins.

Furthermore, IL-35 producers, although rare, secrete Ebi3 and p35 on extracellular vesicles (EVs) targeting a 25- to 100-fold higher number of T and B lymphocytes, causing them to acquire surface IL-35. This surface IL-35 is absent when EV production is inhibited or if Ebi3 is genetically deleted in Treg cells. The unique ability of EVs to coat bystander lymphocytes with IL-35, promoting exhaustion in, and secondary suppression by, non-Treg cells identifies a novel mechanism of infectious tolerance."	0

The molecular diversity of mGluRs is thought to be further expanded by the formation of heterodimers, but the co-expression of mGluR subtypes at the cellular level and the relative propensities of heterodimer formation are not well known. Here, we analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data and find that cortical pyramidal cells express multiple mGluR subtypes with distinct profiles for different receptor combinations. We then develop quantitative, fluorescence-based assays to define the relative homo- and heterodimer propensities across group-I, -II, and -III mGluRs. We find a strong preference for heterodimerization in a number of cases, including mGluR2 with mGluR3, which we confirm in frontal cortex using in situ RNA hybridization and co-immunoprecipitation. Together, our findings support the biological relevance of mGluR heterodimerization and highlight the complex landscape of mGluR populations in the brain."	0

Epidermal basal cells sustain cutaneous tissue maintenance and drive wound healing. Previous studies have probed basal cell heterogeneity in stem and progenitor potential, but a comprehensive dissection of basal cell dynamics during differentiation is lacking. Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell state in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. Pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analyses predict a quasi-linear differentiation hierarchy where basal cells progress from Col17a1<sup>Hi</sup>/Trp63<sup>Hi</sup> state to early-response state, proliferate at the juncture of these two states, or become growth arrested before differentiating into spinous cells. Wound healing induces plasticity manifested by dynamic basal-spinous interconversions at multiple basal transcriptional states.

A variety of <i>FOXC1</i> mutants have been identified in patients diagnosed with the autosomal dominant disease Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which is mainly characterized by abnormal development of the eyes, particularly those who also have accompanying congenital heart defects (CHD). However, the role of FOXC1 in CHD, and how these mutations might impact FOXC1 function, remains elusive. Our previous work provided one clue to possible function, demonstrating that zebrafish <i>foxc1a</i>, an orthologue of human <i>FOXC1</i> essential for heart development, directly regulates the expression of <i>nkx2.5</i>, encoding a transcriptional regulator of cardiac progenitor cells. Abnormal expression of <i>Nkx2-5</i> leads to CHD in mice and is also associated with CHD patients. Whether this link extends to the human system, however, requires investigation. In this study, we demonstrate that FOXC1 does regulate human <i>NKX2-5</i> expression in a dose-dependent manner via direct binding to its proximal promoter. A comparison of FOXC1 mutant function in the rat cardiac cell line H9c2 and zebrafish embryos suggested that the zebrafish embryos might serve as a more representative model system than the H9c2 cells. Finally, we noted that three of the Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome FOXC1 mutations tested increased, whereas a fourth repressed the expression of <i>NKX2-5</i> These results imply that mutant FOXC1s might play etiological roles in CHD by abnormally regulating <i>NKX2-5</i> in the patients. And zebrafish embryos can serve as a useful <i>in vivo</i> platform for rapidly evaluating disease-causing roles of mutated genes."	1
"32493775"	"Crystal structure of a conformational antibody that binds tau oligomers and inhibits pathological seeding by extracts from donors with Alzheimer's disease.Soluble oligomers of aggregated tau accompany the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils, a histological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and two dozen related neurodegenerative diseases. Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of <i>in vitro</i> tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies."	0

To understand how cell-specific gene expression patterns are generated, we study the developmental timing of association of two prominent hepatic transcription factors with gene regulatory regions. Most individual binding events display extraordinarily high temporal variations during liver development. Early and persistent binding is necessary, but not sufficient, for gene activation. Stable gene expression patterns are the result of combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors, which mark regulatory regions long before activation and promote progressive broadening of active chromatin domains. Both temporally stable and dynamic, short-lived binding events contribute to the developmental maturation of active promoter configurations. The results reveal a developmental bookmarking function of master regulators and illuminate remarkable parallels between the principles employed for gene activation during development, during evolution, and upon mitotic exit."	0

We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1.

"32075755"	"ELAC1 Repairs tRNAs Cleaved during Ribosome-Associated Quality Control.Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) disassembles aberrantly stalled translation complexes to recycle or degrade the constituent parts. A key step of RQC is the cleavage of P-site tRNA by the endonuclease ANKZF1 (Vms1 in yeast) to release incompletely synthesized polypeptides from ribosomes for degradation. Re-use of the cleaved tRNA for translation requires re-addition of the universal 3'CCA nucleotides removed by ANKZF1. Here, we show that ELAC1 is both necessary and sufficient to remove the 2',3'-cyclic phosphate on ANKZF1-cleaved tRNAs to permit CCA re-addition by TRNT1. ELAC1 activity is optimized for tRNA recycling, whereas ELAC2, the essential RNase Z isoform in eukaryotes, is required to remove 3' trailers during tRNA biogenesis. Cells lacking ELAC1 specifically accumulate unrepaired tRNA intermediates upon the induction of ribosome stalling. Thus, optimal recycling of ANKZF1-cleaved tRNAs in vertebrates is achieved through the duplication and specialization of a conserved tRNA biosynthesis enzyme."	0

In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (<i>ATXN1</i>), a dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate <i>ATXN1</i> expression remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that <i>ATXN1</i>'s unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator that binds to a conserved site in <i>ATXN1</i>'s 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the possibility that noncoding mutations in the <i>ATXN1</i> locus may act as risk factors for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias."	1

In the absence of Hgh1, a substantial fraction of newly synthesized eEF2 is degraded or aggregates. We solved the crystal structure of Hgh1 and analyzed the interaction of wild-type and mutant Hgh1 with eEF2.

Hgh1 binding recruits TRiC to the C-terminal eEF2 module and prevents unproductive interactions of domain III, allowing efficient folding of the N-terminal GTPase module. eEF2 folding is completed upon dissociation of TRiC and Hgh1."	0

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms have been poorly elucidated. Here we show, in an animal model of internal capsular infarct, that GABA-synthesizing reactive astrocytes in distant cortical areas cause glucose hypometabolism via tonic inhibition of neighboring neurons. We find that reversal of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis, by pharmacological inhibition and astrocyte-specific gene silencing of MAO-B, reverses the reduction in cortical glucose metabolism. Moreover, induction of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis by cortical injection of putrescine or adenovirus recapitulates cortical hypometabolism. Furthermore, MAO-B inhibition causes a remarkable recovery from post-stroke motor deficits when combined with a rehabilitation regimen. Collectively, our data indicate that cortical glucose hypometabolism in subcortical stroke is caused by aberrant astrocytic GABA and MAO-B inhibition and that attenuating cortical hypometabolism can be a therapeutic approach in subcortical stroke."	0

"32518161"	"Loss of the RNA-binding protein Rbm15 disrupts liver maturation in zebrafish.Liver organogenesis begins with hepatic precursors in the foregut endoderm, followed by hepatoblast specification, differentiation, outgrowth, and maturation for the formation of functional hepatocytes. Although several signaling pathways and critical factors that regulate liver specification, differentiation, and proliferation have been identified, little is known about how liver maturation is regulated. Here, we used a screen for mutations affecting liver development in zebrafish and identified a <i>cq96</i> mutant that exhibits a specific defect in liver maturation. Results from positional cloning revealed that <i>cq96</i> encodes an RNA-binding protein, Rbm15, which is an evolutionarily conserved Spen family protein and known to play a crucial role in RNA m6A modification, nuclear export, and alternative splicing. However, a function of Rbm15 in embryonic liver development has not been reported. We found that <i>Rbm15</i> is specifically expressed in the liver after its differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of <i>rbm15</i> repressed hepatic maturation, but did not affect hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in <i>rbm15</i>-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin treatment partially restored normal hepatic gene expression as well as the nuclear location of the transcription factor Hnf4a. Taken together, these results reveal an unexpected role of Rbm15 in liver maturation."	0

"32698008"	"Axon Growth of CNS Neurons in Three Dimensions Is Amoeboid and Independent of Adhesions.During development of the central nervous system (CNS), neurons polarize and rapidly extend their axons to assemble neuronal circuits. The growth cone leads the axon to its target and drives axon growth. Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying axon growth in three dimensions. Live in situ imaging and super-resolution microscopy combined with pharmacological and molecular manipulations as well as biophysical force measurements revealed that growth cones extend CNS axons independent of pulling forces on their substrates and without the need for adhesions in three-dimensional (3D) environments. In 3D, microtubules grow unrestrained from the actomyosin cytoskeleton into the growth cone leading edge to enable rapid axon extension. Axons extend and polarize even in adhesion-inert matrices. Thus, CNS neurons use amoeboid mechanisms to drive axon growth. Together with our understanding that adult CNS axons regenerate by reactivating developmental processes, our findings illuminate how cytoskeletal manipulations enable axon regeneration in the adult CNS."	0
"32846129"	"Mechanical Ring Interfaces between Adherens Junction and Contractile Actomyosin to Coordinate Entotic Cell-in-Cell Formation.Entosis is a cell-in-cell (CIC)-mediated death program. Contractile actomyosin (CA) and the adherens junction (AJ) are two core elements essential for entotic CIC formation, but the molecular structures interfacing them remain poorly understood. Here, we report the characterization of a ring-like structure interfacing between the peripheries of invading and engulfing cells. The ring-like structure is a multi-molecular complex consisting of adhesive and cytoskeletal proteins, in which the mechanical sensor vinculin is highly enriched. The vinculin-enriched structure senses mechanical force imposed on cells, as indicated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, and is thus termed the mechanical ring (MR). The MR actively interacts with CA and the AJ to help establish and maintain polarized actomyosin that drives cell internalization. Vinculin depletion leads to compromised MR formation, CA depolarization, and subsequent CIC failure. In summary, we suggest that the vinculin-enriched MR, in addition to CA and AJ, is another core element essential for entosis."	0

Here, we show that livers deficient in the oscillator component JARID1a exhibit a dysregulation of genes involved in energy metabolism. Importantly, we find that mice that lack hepatic JARID1a have decreased lean body mass, decreased respiratory exchange ratios, faster production of ketones, and increased glucose production in response to fasting. Finally, we find that JARID1a loss compromises the response of the hepatic transcriptome to nutrient availability. In all, ablation of hepatic JARID1a disrupts the coordination of hepatic metabolic programs with whole-body consequences."	0
"32937124"	"The Natural Compound Notopterol Binds and Targets JAK2/3 to Ameliorate Inflammation and Arthritis.The traditional Chinese medicinal herb Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H.T. Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients' serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway."	1
"32814043"	"Proteolytic Restriction of Chordin Range Underlies BMP Gradient Formation.A fundamental question in developmental biology is how morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), form precise signaling gradients to impart positional and functional identity to the cells of the early embryo. We combine rigorous mutant analyses with quantitative immunofluorescence to determine that the proteases Bmp1a and Tolloid spatially restrict the BMP antagonist Chordin in dorsoventral (DV) axial patterning of the early zebrafish gastrula. We show that maternally deposited Bmp1a plays an unexpected and non-redundant role in establishing the BMP signaling gradient, while the Bmp1a/Tolloid antagonist Sizzled is surprisingly dispensable. Combining computational modeling and in vivo analyses with an immobile Chordin construct, we demonstrate that long-range Chordin diffusion is not necessary for BMP gradient formation and DV patterning. Our data do not support a counter-gradient of Chordin and instead favor a Chordin sink, established by Bmp1a and Tolloid, as the primary mechanism that drives BMP gradient formation."	1
"32234471"	"Structure and Function of an Elongation Factor P Subfamily in Actinobacteria.Translation of consecutive proline motifs causes ribosome stalling and requires rescue via the action of a specific translation elongation factor, EF-P in bacteria and archaeal/eukaryotic a/eIF5A. In Eukarya, Archaea, and all bacteria investigated so far, the functionality of this translation elongation factor depends on specific and rather unusual post-translational modifications. The phylum Actinobacteria, which includes the genera Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and Streptomyces, is of both medical and economic significance. Here, we report that EF-P is required in these bacteria in particular for the translation of proteins involved in amino acid and secondary metabolite production. Notably, EF-P of Actinobacteria species does not need any post-translational modification for activation. While the function and overall 3D structure of this EF-P type is conserved, the loop containing the conserved lysine is flanked by two essential prolines that rigidify it. Actinobacteria's EF-P represents a unique subfamily that works without any modification."	0
"32783945"	"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Childhood Ependymoma Reveals Neoplastic Cell Subpopulations That Impact Molecular Classification and Etiology.Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity increases understanding of EPN biology."	0
"32579912"	"Neurotoxic Reactive Astrocytes Drive Neuronal Death after Retinal Injury.Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that features the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the retina, often as a result of prolonged increases in intraocular pressure. We show that preventing the formation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes prevents the death of RGCs normally seen in a mouse model of glaucoma. Furthermore, we show that these spared RGCs are electrophysiologically functional and thus still have potential value for the function and regeneration of the retina. Finally, we demonstrate that the death of RGCs depends on a combination of both an injury to the neurons and the presence of reactive astrocytes, suggesting a model that may explain why reactive astrocytes are toxic only in some circumstances. Altogether, these findings highlight reactive astrocytes as drivers of RGC death in a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the eye."	0
"32846123"	"A Single Human V<sub>H</sub>-gene Allows for a Broad-Spectrum Antibody Response Targeting Bacterial Lipopolysaccharides in the Blood.B cell receptors (BCRs) display a combination of variable (V)-gene-encoded complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and adaptive/hypervariable CDR3 loops to engage antigens. It has long been proposed that the former tune for recognition of pathogens or groups of pathogens. To experimentally evaluate this within the human antibody repertoire, we perform immune challenges in transgenic mice that bear diverse human CDR3 and light chains but are constrained to different human V<sub>H</sub><sub>-</sub>genes. We find that, of six commonly deployed V<sub>H</sub> sequences, only those CDRs encoded by IGHV1-2<sup>∗</sup>02 enable polyclonal antibody responses against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when introduced to the bloodstream. The LPS is from diverse strains of gram-negative bacteria, and the V<sub>H</sub>-gene-dependent responses are directed against the non-variable and universal saccrolipid substructure of this antigen. This reveals a broad-spectrum anti-LPS response in which germline-encoded CDRs naturally hardwire the human antibody repertoire for recognition of a conserved microbial target."	0
"32620552"	"Phosphorylation on Ser-359 of the α2 subunit in GABA type A receptors down-regulates their density at inhibitory synapses.GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) mediate fast synaptic inhibition and are trafficked to functionally diverse synapses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition. The MS data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange, with the data set identifier PXD019597."	1
"32320649"	"The Set7 Lysine Methyltransferase Regulates Plasticity in Oxidative Phosphorylation Necessary for Trained Immunity Induced by β-Glucan.Trained immunity confers a sustained augmented response of innate immune cells to a secondary challenge, via a process dependent on metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. Because of its previous associations with metabolic and transcriptional memory, as well as the importance of H3 histone lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) to innate immune memory, we hypothesize that the Set7 methyltransferase has an important role in trained immunity induced by β-glucan. Using pharmacological studies of human primary monocytes, we identify trained immunity-specific immunometabolic pathways regulated by Set7, including a previously unreported H3K4me1-dependent plasticity in the induction of oxidative phosphorylation. Recapitulation of β-glucan training in vivo additionally identifies Set7-dependent changes in gene expression previously associated with the modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors in trained immunity. By revealing Set7 as a key regulator of trained immunity, these findings provide mechanistic insight into sustained metabolic changes and underscore the importance of characterizing regulatory circuits of innate immune memory."	0
"32075753"	"Glioma-Derived miRNA-Containing Extracellular Vesicles Induce Angiogenesis by Reprogramming Brain Endothelial Cells.Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by aberrant vascularization and a complex tumor microenvironment. The failure of anti-angiogenic therapies suggests pathways of GBM neovascularization, possibly attributable to glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and their interplay with the tumor microenvironment. It has been established that GSC-derived extracellular vesicles (GSC-EVs) and their cargoes are proangiogenic in vitro. To further elucidate EV-mediated mechanisms of neovascularization in vitro, we perform RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiling of human brain endothelial cells exposed to GSC-EVs. To correlate these results to tumors in vivo, we perform histoepigenetic analysis of GBM molecular profiles in the TCGA collection. Remarkably, GSC-EVs and normal vascular growth factors stimulate highly distinct gene regulatory responses that converge on angiogenesis. The response to GSC-EVs shows a footprint of post-transcriptional gene silencing by EV-derived miRNAs. Our results provide insights into targetable angiogenesis pathways in GBM and miRNA candidates for liquid biopsy biomarkers."	0
"32580945"	"Adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles containing microRNA-26a-5p target TLR4 and protect against diabetic nephropathy.Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a complication of diabetes that is increasing in prevalence in China. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying microRNAs (miRs) may represent a useful tool in the development of therapies for DN. Here, we report that EVs released by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) during DN contain a microRNA, miR-26a-5p, that suppresses DN. Using bioinformatic analyses, we identified differentially expressed miRs in EVs from ADSCs and in DN and predicted downstream regulatory target genes. We isolated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adipose tissues and collected EVs from the ADSCs. We exposed mouse glomerular podocytes and MP5 cells to high glucose (HG), ADSC-derived EVs, miR-26a-5p inhibitor/antagomir, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plasmids, or the NF-κB pathway activator (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, or PMA). We used the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry to investigate the impact of miR-26a-5p on cell viability and apoptosis and validated the results of these assays with <i>in vivo</i> experiments in nude mice. We found that in DN, miR-26a-5p is expressed at very low levels, whereas TLR4 is highly expressed. Of note, EVs from ADSCs ameliorated the pathological symptoms of DN in diabetic mice and transferred miR-26a-5p to HG-induced MP5 cells, improving viability while suppressing the apoptosis of MP5 cells. We also found that miR-26a-5p protects HG-induced MP5 cells from injury by targeting TLR4, inactivating the NF-κB pathway, and downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Moreover, ADSC-derived EVs transferred miR-26a-5p to mouse glomerular podocytes, which ameliorated DN pathology. These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p from ADSC-derived EVs protects against DN."	0

We report a new RES-Xre TA system in multiple human pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The toxin, MbcT, is bactericidal unless neutralized by its antitoxin MbcA. To investigate the mechanism, we solved the 1.8 Å-resolution crystal structure of the MbcTA complex. We found that MbcT resembles secreted NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent bacterial exotoxins, such as diphtheria toxin. Indeed, MbcT catalyzes NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation in vitro and in vivo. Unexpectedly, the reaction is stimulated by inorganic phosphate, and our data reveal that MbcT is a NAD<sup>+</sup> phosphorylase.

Our study expands the molecular activities employed by bacterial TA modules and uncovers a new class of enzymes that could be exploited to treat tuberculosis and other infectious diseases."	0
"32492417"	"Epigenetic Reprogramming of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Deregulates Glucose Metabolism and Facilitates Progression of Breast Cancer.The mechanistic contributions of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in breast cancer progression remain to be fully understood. While altered glucose metabolism in CAFs could fuel cancer cells, how such metabolic reprogramming emerges and is sustained needs further investigation. Studying fibroblasts isolated from patients with benign breast tissues and breast cancer, in conjunction with multiple animal models, we demonstrate that CAFs exhibit a metabolic shift toward lactate and pyruvate production and fuel biosynthetic pathways of cancer cells. The depletion or suppression of the lactate production of CAFs alter the tumor metabolic profile and impede tumor growth. The glycolytic phenotype of the CAFs is in part sustained through epigenetic reprogramming of HIF-1α and glycolytic enzymes. Hypoxia induces epigenetic reprogramming of normal fibroblasts, resulting in a pro-glycolytic, CAF-like transcriptome. Our findings suggest that the glucose metabolism of CAFs evolves during tumor progression, and their breast cancer-promoting phenotype is partly mediated by oxygen-dependent epigenetic modifications."	0

In this study, using Xenopus laevis embryos and phosphoproteome analyses, we uncover the rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk2 upon stimulation with centrifugal, compression, or stretching force. We demonstrate that Erk2 induces the remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins, including F-actin, an embryonic cadherin C-cadherin, and the tight junction protein ZO-1. We show these force-dependent changes to be prerequisites for the enhancement of cellular junctions and tissue stiffening during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, Erk2 activation is FGFR1 dependent while not requiring fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands, suggesting that cell/tissue deformation triggers receptor activation in the absence of ligands. These findings establish previously unrecognized functions for mechanical forces in embryogenesis and reveal its underlying force-induced signaling pathways."	0
"32049006"	"A Switch in Tissue Stem Cell Identity Causes Neuroendocrine Tumors in Drosophila Gut.Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are able to generate gut-specific enterocytes, as well as neural-like enteroendocrine cells. It is unclear how the tissue identity of the ISC lineage is regulated to confer cell-lineage fidelity. Here, we show that, in adult Drosophila midgut, loss of the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack in ISCs causes a self-renewal program switch to neural stem cell (NSC)-like, and that switch drives neuroendocrine tumor development. In Tramtrack-depleted ISCs, the ectopically expressed Deadpan acts as a major self-renewal factor for cell propagation, and Sequoia acts as a differentiation factor for the neuroendocrine phenotype. In addition, the expression of Sequoia renders NSC-specific self-renewal genes responsive to Notch in ISCs, thus inverting the differentiation-promoting function of Notch into a self-renewal role as in normal NSCs. These results suggest an active maintenance mechanism for the gut identity of ISCs, whose disruption may lead to an improper acquisition of NSC-like traits and tumorigenesis."	0
"32187541"	"Changes in Gut Microbiota by Chronic Stress Impair the Efficacy of Fluoxetine.Major depressive disorders (MDDs) constitute a leading cause of disability worldwide and current pharmacological treatments are partially effective. The gut microbiota (GM) has recently emerged as a target of therapeutic interest for MDDs. In this study, we transfer GM from mice that sustained unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to healthy recipient mice. The fecal transfer induces despair-like behavior, decreases neurogenesis in the hippocampus (HpC), and impairs the antidepressant and neurogenic effects of a standard selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (FLX). These effects are paralleled by deficits in 5-HT bioavailability, biosynthesis, and reuptake in the HpC. Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan restores the levels of 5-HT and its precursors in the HpC, improves HpC neurogenesis, and alleviates despair-like symptoms. Our results reveal that stress-induced changes in GM are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders and minimize FLX efficacy via alterations in the serotonergic pathway of Trp metabolism."	0

The role of the MCIA complex and the involvement of other proteins in the biogenesis of this module is unclear. Cell knockout studies reveal that while each MCIA component is critical for complex I assembly, a hierarchy of stability exists centered on ACAD9. We also identify TMEM186 and COA1 as bona fide components of the MCIA complex with loss of either resulting in MCIA complex defects and reduced complex I assembly. TMEM186 enriches with newly translated ND3, and COA1 enriches with ND2. Our findings provide new functional insights into the essential nature of the MCIA complex in complex I assembly."	0

The electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Cx26 GJC at physiological pH recapitulates previous GJC structures in lipid bilayers. At pH 6.4, we identify two conformational states, one resembling the open physiological-pH structure and a closed conformation that displays six threads of density, that join to form a pore-occluding density. Crosslinking and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveal closer association between the N-terminal (NT) domains and the cytoplasmic loops (CL) at acidic pH. Previous electrophysiologic studies suggest an association between NT residue N14 and H100 near M2, which may trigger the observed movement of M2 toward M1 in our cryo-EM maps, thereby accounting for additional NT-CL crosslinks at acidic pH. We propose that these pH-induced interactions and conformational changes result in extension, ordering, and association of the acetylated NT domains to form a hexameric ""ball-and-chain"" gating particle."	0
"32333838"	"DNA Methylation Regulates Alternative Polyadenylation via CTCF and the Cohesin Complex.Dysregulation of DNA methylation and mRNA alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) are both prevalent in cancer and have been studied as independent processes. We discovered a DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism when we compared genome-wide DNA methylation and polyadenylation site usage between DNA methylation-competent and DNA methylation-deficient cells. Here, we show that removal of DNA methylation enables CTCF binding and recruitment of the cohesin complex, which, in turn, form chromatin loops that promote proximal polyadenylation site usage. In this DNA demethylated context, either deletion of the CTCF binding site or depletion of RAD21 cohesin complex protein can recover distal polyadenylation site usage. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we authenticated the relationship between DNA methylation and mRNA polyadenylation isoform expression in vivo. This DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism demonstrates how aberrant DNA methylation impacts transcriptome diversity and highlights the potential sequelae of global DNA methylation inhibition as a cancer treatment."	0

We therefore developed a single-component system that could induce the rapid degradation of the specific endogenous protein itself. A construct combining the RING domain of ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 with a protein-specific camelid nanobody mediates target destruction by the ubiquitin proteasome system, a process we describe as antibody RING-mediated destruction (ARMeD). The technique is highly specific because we observed no off-target protein destruction.

"32675287"	"Peroxidasin mediates bromination of tyrosine residues in the extracellular matrix.Peroxidasin is a heme peroxidase that oxidizes bromide to hypobromous acid (HOBr), a powerful oxidant that promotes the formation of the sulfilimine crosslink in collagen IV in basement membranes. We investigated whether HOBr released by peroxidasin leads to other oxidative modifications of proteins, particularly bromination of tyrosine residues, in peroxidasin-expressing PFHR9 cells. Using stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS, we detected the formation of 3-bromotyrosine, a specific biomarker of HOBr-mediated protein modification. The level of 3-bromotyrosine in extracellular matrix proteins from normally cultured cells was 1.1 mmol/mol tyrosine and decreased significantly in the presence of the peroxidasin inhibitor, phloroglucinol. A negligible amount of 3-bromotyrosine was detected in peroxidasin-knockout cells. 3-Bromotyrosine formed both during cell growth in culture and in the isolated decellularized extracellular matrix when embedded peroxidasin was supplied with hydrogen peroxide and bromide. The level of 3-bromotyrosine was significantly higher in extracellular matrix than intracellular proteins, although a low amount was detected intracellularly. 3-Bromotyrosine levels increased with higher bromide concentrations and decreased in the presence of physiological concentrations of thiocyanate and urate. However, these peroxidase substrates showed moderate to minimal inhibition of collagen IV crosslinking. Our findings provide evidence that peroxidasin promotes the formation of 3-bromotyrosine in proteins. They show that HOBr produced by peroxidasin is selective for, but not limited to, the crosslinking of collagen IV. Based on our findings, the use of 3-bromotyrosine as a specific biomarker of oxidative damage by HOBr warrants further investigation in clinical conditions linked to high peroxidasin expression."	0

In the LIFT pathway, lipidated cargoes are transported into the cilia through the coordinated actions of cargo carrier proteins such as Unc119 or PDE6δ, as well as small GTPases Arl13b and Arl3 in the cilium. Our previous studies have revealed a single Arl13b ortholog in the evolutionarily divergent <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness.

"32533919"	"Stress Can Induce Transcription of Toxin-Antitoxin Systems without Activating Toxin.Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous genetic elements in bacterial genomes, but their functions are controversial. Although they are frequently postulated to regulate cell growth following stress, few null phenotypes for TA systems have been reported. Here, we show that TA transcript levels can increase substantially in response to stress, but toxin is not liberated. We find that the growth of an Escherichia coli strain lacking ten TA systems encoding endoribonuclease toxins is not affected following exposure to six stresses that each trigger TA transcription. Additionally, using RNA sequencing, we find no evidence of mRNA cleavage following stress. Stress-induced transcription arises from antitoxin degradation and relief of transcriptional autoregulation. Importantly, although free antitoxin is readily degraded in vivo, antitoxin bound to toxin is protected from proteolysis, preventing release of active toxin. Thus, transcription is not a reliable marker of TA activity, and TA systems do not strongly promote survival following individual stresses."	0

Using a combined approach of metabolomics, proteomics, mRNA expression analysis, and enzymatic activity measurements, we demonstrate that Tsc2, a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling, critically influences the cellular activity of macrophages by regulating the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) in an mTORC1-dependent manner. More generally, while lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages repress Phgdh activity, IL-4-stimulated macrophages increase the activity of the enzyme required for the expression of key anti-inflammatory molecules and macrophage proliferation. Thus, we identify Phgdh as a metabolic checkpoint of M2 macrophages."	0
"30879903"	"MDM2 Integrates Cellular Respiration and Apoptotic Signaling through NDUFS1 and the Mitochondrial Network.Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2."	1
"32610137"	"Promiscuous Binding of Microprotein Mozart1 to γ-Tubulin Complex Mediates Specific Subcellular Targeting to Control Microtubule Array Formation.How γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a master template for microtubule nucleation, is spatially and temporally regulated for the assembly of new microtubule arrays remains unclear. Here, we report that an evolutionarily conserved microprotein, Mozart1 (Mzt1), regulates subcellular targeting and microtubule formation activity of γ-TuRC at different cell cycle stages. Crystal structures of protein complexes demonstrate that Mzt1 promiscuously interacts with the N-terminal domains of multiple γ-tubulin complex protein subunits in γ-TuRC via an intercalative binding mode. Genetic- and microscopy-based analyses show that promiscuous binding of Mzt1 in γ-TuRC controls specific subcellular localization of γ-TuRC to modulate microtubule nucleation and stabilization in fission yeast. Moreover, we find Mzt1-independent targeting of γ-TuRC to be crucial for mitotic spindle assembly, demonstrating the cell-cycle-dependent regulation and function of γ-TuRC. Our findings reveal a microprotein-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying microtubule cytoskeleton formation, whereby Mzt1 binding promiscuity confers localization specificity on the multi-protein complex γ-TuRC."	0
"32905769"	"Atf-6 Regulates Lifespan through ER-Mitochondrial Calcium Homeostasis.Individually, dysfunction of both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria has been linked to aging, but how communication between these organelles might be targeted to promote longevity is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, inhibition of the conserved unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) mediator, activating transcription factor (atf)-6, increases lifespan by modulating calcium homeostasis and signaling to mitochondria. Atf-6 loss confers longevity via downregulation of the ER calcium buffer, calreticulin. ER calcium release via the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R/itr-1) is required for longevity, while IP<sub>3</sub>R/itr-1 gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan. Highlighting coordination between organelles, the mitochondrial calcium import channel mcu-1 is also required for atf-6 longevity. IP<sub>3</sub>R inhibition leads to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and hyperfusion, which is sufficient to suppress long life in atf-6 mutants. This study reveals the importance of organellar calcium handling as a critical output for the UPR<sup>ER</sup> in determining the quality of aging."	0
"32783929"	"Persistent Activation of mRNA Translation by Transient Hsp90 Inhibition.The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone functions as a protein-folding buffer and plays a role promoting the evolution of new heritable traits. To better understand how Hsp90 can affect mRNA translation, we screen more than 1,600 factors involved in mRNA regulation for physical interactions with Hsp90 in human cells. The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 results in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persists for 30 generations after the inhibitor is removed. Ribosomal profiling reveals that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, transient loss of Hsp90 function can promote a nongenetic inheritance of a translational state affecting specific mRNAs, introducing a mechanism by which Hsp90 can promote phenotypic variation."	0
"32049012"	"HILPDA Uncouples Lipid Droplet Accumulation in Adipose Tissue Macrophages from Inflammation and Metabolic Dysregulation.Obesity leads to a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation that features the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in adipose tissue. Here, we determined the role of macrophage lipid-droplet accumulation in the development of obesity-induced adipose-tissue inflammation, using mice with myeloid-specific deficiency of the lipid-inducible HILPDA protein. HILPDA deficiency markedly reduced intracellular lipid levels and accumulation of fluorescently labeled fatty acids. Decreased lipid storage in HILPDA-deficient macrophages can be rescued by inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and is associated with increased oxidative metabolism. In diet-induced obese mice, HILPDA deficiency does not alter inflammatory and metabolic parameters, despite markedly reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages. Overall, we find that HILPDA is a lipid-inducible, physiological inhibitor of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in macrophages and uncouples lipid storage in adipose tissue macrophages from inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Our data question the contribution of lipid droplet accumulation in adipose tissue macrophages in obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic dysregulation."	0
"32640232"	"Functional Convergence of Autonomic and Sensorimotor Processing in the Lateral Cerebellum.The cerebellum is involved in the control of voluntary and autonomic rhythmic behaviors, yet it is unclear to what extent it coordinates these in concert. We studied Purkinje cell activity during unperturbed and perturbed respiration in lobules simplex, crus 1, and crus 2. During unperturbed (eupneic) respiration, complex spike and simple spike activity encode the phase of ongoing sensorimotor processing. In contrast, when the respiratory cycle is perturbed by whisker stimulation, mice concomitantly protract their whiskers and advance their inspiration in a phase-dependent manner, preceded by increased simple spike activity. This phase advancement of respiration in response to whisker stimulation can be mimicked by optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells and prevented by cell-specific genetic modification of their AMPA receptors, hampering increased simple spike firing. Thus, the impact of Purkinje cell activity on respiratory control is context and phase dependent, highlighting a coordinating role for the cerebellar hemispheres in aligning autonomic and sensorimotor behaviors."	0

Biomarkers such as β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils and Tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease are accessible only via invasive cerebrospinal fluid assays, and reactive oxygen species can be fleeting and challenging to monitor <i>in vivo</i> Although remaining a challenge for <i>in vivo</i> detection, the protein-protein interactions underlying these disease-specific biomarkers present opportunities for the engineering of <i>in vitro</i> pathology-sensitive biosensors. These tools can be useful for investigating early stage events in neurodegenerative diseases in both cellular and animal models and may lead to clinically useful reagents. Here, we report a light- and cellular stress-gated protein switch based on cofilin-actin rod formation, occurring in stressed neurons in the Alzheimer's disease brain and following ischemia. By coupling the stress-sensitive cofilin-actin interaction with the light-responsive Cry2-CIB blue-light switch, referred to hereafter as the CofActor, we accomplished both light- and energetic/oxidative stress-gated control of this interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of both cofilin and actin revealed residues critical for sustaining or abrogating the light- and stress-gated response. Of note, the switch response varied depending on whether cellular stress was generated via glycolytic inhibition or by both glycolytic inhibition and azide-induced ATP depletion. We also demonstrate light- and cellular stress-gated switch function in cultured hippocampal neurons. CofActor holds promise for the tracking of early stage events in neurodegeneration and for investigating actin's interactions with other proteins during cellular stress."	0
"32610125"	"Zygotic Nuclear F-Actin Safeguards Embryonic Development.After fertilization, sperm and oocyte nuclei are rapidly remodeled to form swollen pronuclei (PN) in mammalian zygotes, and the proper formation and function of PN are key to producing totipotent zygotes. However, how mature PN are formed has been unclear. We find that filamentous actin (F-actin) assembles in the PN of mouse zygotes and is required for fully functional PN. The perturbation of nuclear actin dynamics in zygotes results in the misregulation of genes related to genome integrity and abnormal development of mouse embryos. We show that nuclear F-actin ensures DNA damage repair, thus preventing the activation of a zygotic checkpoint. Furthermore, optogenetic control of cofilin nuclear localization reveals the dynamically regulated F-actin nucleoskeleton in zygotes, and its timely disassembly is needed for developmental progression. Nuclear F-actin is a hallmark of totipotent zygotic PN, and the temporal regulation of its polymerized state is necessary for normal embryonic development."	0

Despite its important roles, the molecular mechanism underlying m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated gene regulation is poorly understood. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs are subject to endoribonucleolytic cleavage via YTHDF2 (m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein), HRSP12 (adaptor protein), and RNase P/MRP (endoribonucleases). We demonstrate that HRSP12 functions as an adaptor to bridge YTHDF2 and RNase P/MRP, eliciting rapid degradation of YTHDF2-bound RNAs. Transcriptome-wide analyses show that m<sup>6</sup>A RNAs that are preferentially targeted for endoribonucleolytic cleavage have an HRSP12-binding site and a RNase P/MRP-directed cleavage site upstream and downstream of the YTHDF2-binding site, respectively. We also find that a subset of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing circular RNAs associates with YTHDF2 in an HRSP12-dependent manner and is selectively downregulated by RNase P/MRP. Thus, our data expand the known functions of RNase P/MRP to endoribonucleolytic cleavage of m<sup>6</sup>A RNAs."	0

We have determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of complete Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA transcription elongation complexes, comprising RNA polymerase; DNA; RNA bearing an N-utilization-site-like anti-termination element; Nus factors A, B, E, and G; inositol mono-phosphatase SuhB; and ribosomal protein S4. Our structures and structure-informed functional analyses show that fast transcription and anti-termination involve suppression of NusA-stabilized pausing, enhancement of NusG-mediated anti-backtracking, sequestration of the NusG C-terminal domain from termination factor ρ, and the ρ blockade. Strikingly, the factors form a composite RNA chaperone around the RNA polymerase RNA-exit tunnel, which supports co-transcriptional RNA folding and annealing of distal RNA regions. Our work reveals a polymerase/chaperone machine required for biosynthesis of functional ribosomes."	0
"32726637"	"L ARP7 Is a BRCA1 Ubiquitinase Substrate and Regulates Genome Stability and Tumorigenesis.Attenuated DNA repair leads to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy."	1
"31628042"	"PTPS Facilitates Compartmentalized LTBP1 S-Nitrosylation and Promotes Tumor Growth under Hypoxia.GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR) are sequentially responsible for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a known co-factor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The implication of BH4-biosynthesis process in tumorigenesis remains to be investigated. Here, we show that PTPS, which is highly expressed in early-stage colorectal cancer, is phosphorylated at Thr 58 by AMPK under hypoxia; this phosphorylation promotes PTPS binding to LTBP1 and subsequently drives iNOS-mediated LTBP1 S-nitrosylation through proximal-coupling BH4 production within the PTPS/iNOS/LTBP1 complex. In turn, LTBP1 S-nitrosylation results in proteasome-dependent LTBP1 protein degradation, revealing an inverse relationship between PTPS pT58 and LTBP1 stability. Physiologically, the repressive effect of PTPS on LTBP1 leads to impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and thereby maintains tumor cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LTBP1-TGF-β signaling by the BH4-biosynthesis pathway and highlight the specific requirement of PTPS for tumor growth."	1
"32647008"	"Motoneuron expression profiling identifies an association between an axonal splice variant of HDGF-related protein 3 and peripheral myelination.Disorders that disrupt myelin formation during development or in adulthood, such as multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies, lead to severe pathologies, illustrating myelin's crucial role in normal neural functioning. However, although our understanding of glial biology is increasing, the signals that emanate from axons and regulate myelination remain largely unknown. To identify the core components of the myelination process, here we adopted a microarray analysis approach combined with laser-capture microdissection of spinal motoneurons during the myelinogenic phase of development. We identified neuronal genes whose expression was enriched during myelination and further investigated hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 3 (HRP3 or HDGFRP3). HRP3 was strongly expressed in the white matter fiber tracts of the peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nervous systems during myelination and remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The dynamic localization of HPR3 between axons and nuclei during myelination was consistent with its axonal localization during neuritogenesis. To study this phenomenon, we identified two splice variants encoded by the <i>HRP3</i> gene: the canonical isoform HRP3-I and a newly recognized isoform, HRP3-II. HRP3-I remained solely in the nucleus, whereas HRP3-II displayed distinct axonal localization both before and during myelination. Interestingly, HRP3-II remained in the nuclei of unmyelinated neurons and glial cells, suggesting the existence of a molecular machinery that transfers it to and retains it in the axons of neurons fated for myelination. Overexpression of HRP3-II, but not of HRP3-I, increased Schwann cell numbers and myelination in PNS neuron-glia co-cultures. However, HRP3-II overexpression in CNS co-cultures did not alter myelination."	0

To determine whether HMCES responds to the ssDNA abasic site in cells, we exploited the activity of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A). APOBEC3A preferentially deaminates cytosines to uracils in ssDNA, which are then converted to abasic sites by uracil DNA glycosylase. We find that HMCES-deficient cells are hypersensitive to nuclear APOBEC3A localization. HMCES relocalizes to chromatin in response to nuclear APOBEC3A and protects abasic sites from processing into double-strand breaks (DSBs). Abasic sites induced by APOBEC3A slow both leading and lagging strand synthesis, and HMCES prevents further slowing of the replication fork by translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases zeta (Polζ) and kappa (Polκ). Thus, our study provides direct evidence that HMCES responds to ssDNA abasic sites in cells to prevent DNA cleavage and balance the engagement of TLS polymerases."	0
"32937132"	"Toll-like Receptor 5 Activation by the CagY Repeat Domains of Helicobacter pylori.Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is an important human pathogen associated with gastric inflammation and neoplasia. It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation. Here, we identify CagY as a flagellin-independent TLR5 agonist. We detect five TLR5 interaction sites, promoting binding of CagY-positive Hp to TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 stimulation, and intracellular signal transduction. Consequently, CagY constitutes a remarkable VirB10 member detected by TLR5, driving crucial innate immune responses by this human pathogen."	0

We investigate whether β-glucan exposure confers protection against pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. β-glucan induces trained immunity via histone modifications at gene promoters in human monocytes, which is accompanied by the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines upon secondary Mtb challenge and inhibition of Mtb growth. Mice treated with β-glucan are significantly protected against pulmonary Mtb infection, which is associated with the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and increased myelopoiesis. The protective signature of β-glucan is mediated via IL-1 signaling, as β-glucan shows no protection in mice lacking a functional IL-1 receptor (IL1R<sup>-/-</sup>). The administration of β-glucan may be used as a novel strategy in the treatment of mycobacterial infections and possibly as an adjuvant to improve anti-tuberculosis vaccines."	0

Germinal center (GC) formation in lymph nodes and spleen strictly requires SLAM-associated protein (SAP)-mediated T cell functions; however, it is not known whether this mechanism plays a similar role in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. Here, we find that in Peyer's patches (PPs), SAP-mediated T cell help is required for promoting B cell selection in GCs, but not for clonal diversification. PPs of SAP-deficient mice host chronic GCs that are absent in T cell-deficient mice. GC B cells in SAP-deficient mice express AID and Bcl6 and generate plasma cells in proportion to the GC size. Single-cell IgA sequencing analysis reveals that these mice host few diversified clones that were subjected to mild selection forces.

Here, we uncover an unexpected mode of processing of the bicistronic miR-15a-16-1 cluster. We find that the primary miR-15a stem-loop is not processed on its own but that the presence of the neighboring primary miR-16-1 stem-loop on the same transcript can compensate for this deficiency in cis. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identify SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) as an essential co-factor in this miR-16-1-assisted pri-miR-15 cleavage and describe SAFB2 as an accessory protein of the Microprocessor. Notably, SAFB2-mediated cleavage expands to other clustered pri-miRNAs, indicating a general mechanism. Together, our study reveals an unrecognized function of SAFB2 in miRNA processing and suggests a scenario in which SAFB2 enables the binding and processing of suboptimal Microprocessor substrates in clustered primary miRNA transcripts."	0

However, its function in pluripotency regulation remains elusive. In this study, we find that under the ""ground state"" of pluripotency with two inhibitors (2i) of the MEK and GSK3 pathways, Setdb1-knockout fails to induce trophectoderm (TE) differentiation as in serum/LIF (SL), indicating that TE fate restriction is not the direct target of SETDB1. In both conditions, Setdb1-knockout activates a group of genes targeted by SETDB1-mediated H3K9 methylation, including Dux. Notably, Dux is indispensable for the reactivation of 2C-like state genes upon Setdb1 deficiency, delineating the mechanistic role of SETDB1 in totipotency restriction. Furthermore, Setdb1-null ESCs maintain pluripotent marker (e.g., Nanog) expression in the 2i condition. This ""ground state"" Setdb1-null population undergoes rapid cell death by activating Ripk3 and, subsequently, RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis.

We devised a novel strategy to test the phenotypic impact of individual microRNA-target interactions by disrupting each predicted miRNA-binding site by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in <i>C. elegans</i> We developed a multiplexed negative selection screening approach in which edited loci are deep sequenced, and candidate sites are prioritized based on apparent selection pressure against mutations that disrupt miRNA binding. Importantly, our screen was conducted in vivo on mutant animals, allowing us to interrogate organism-level phenotypes. We used this approach to screen for phenotypic targets of the essential <i>mir-35-42</i> family. By generating 1130 novel 3'UTR alleles across all predicted targets, we identified <i>egl-1</i> as a phenotypic target whose derepression partially phenocopies the <i>mir-35-42</i> mutant phenotype by inducing embryonic lethality and low fecundity. These phenotypes can be rescued by compensatory CRISPR mutations that retarget <i>mir-35</i> to the mutant <i>egl-1</i> 3'UTR.

"32579921"	"The Kinase Activity of Drosophila BubR1 Is Required for Insulin Signaling-Dependent Stem Cell Maintenance.As a core component of the mitotic checkpoint complex, BubR1 has a modular organization of molecular functions, with KEN box and other motifs at the N terminus inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and a kinase domain at the C terminus, whose function remains unsettled, especially at organismal levels. We generate knock-in BubR1 mutations in the Drosophila genome to separately disrupt the KEN box and the kinase domain. All of the mutants are homozygously viable and fertile and show no defects in mitotic progression. The mutants without kinase activity have an increased lifespan and phenotypic changes associated with attenuated insulin signaling, including reduced InR on the cell membrane, weakened PI3K and AKT activity, and elevated expression of dFoxO targets. The BubR1 kinase-dead mutants have a reduced cap cell number in female germaria, which can be rescued by expressing a constitutively active InR. We conclude that one major physiological role of BubR1 kinase in Drosophila is to modulate insulin signaling."	0
"30819644"	"Selective Roles of Vertebrate PCF11 in Premature and Full-Length Transcript Termination.The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including mNET-seq, 3' mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and consequent gene downregulation. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination."	0

Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation can potently induce G0 arrest and SAMHD1 antiretroviral activity by an interferon (IFN)-independent pathway. This pathway requires TLR4 engagement with TRIF, but not involvement of TBK1 or IRF3. Exclusive Myd88 activators are unable to trigger G0 arrest or SAMHD1 dephosphorylation, demonstrating this arrest is also Myd88/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) independent. The G0 arrest is accompanied by p21 upregulation and CDK1 depletion, consistent with the observed SAMHD1 dephosphorylation at T592. Furthermore, we show by SAMHD1 knockdown that the TLR4-activated pathway potently blocks HIV-1 infection in macrophages specifically via SAMHD1. Together, these data demonstrate that macrophages can mobilize an intrinsic cell arrest and anti-viral state by activating TLR4 prior to IFN secretion, thereby highlighting the importance of cell-cycle regulation as a response to pathogen-associated danger signals in macrophages."	0
"30581146"	"Role of Mitochondria in Ferroptosis.Ferroptosis is a regulated necrosis process driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Although ferroptosis and cellular metabolism interplay with one another, whether mitochondria are involved in ferroptosis is under debate. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondria play a crucial role in cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis but not in that induced by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), the most downstream component of the ferroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, cysteine deprivation leads to mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization and lipid peroxide accumulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial TCA cycle or electron transfer chain (ETC) mitigated mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, lipid peroxide accumulation, and ferroptosis. Blockage of glutaminolysis had the same inhibitory effect, which was counteracted by supplying downstream TCA cycle intermediates. Importantly, loss of function of fumarate hydratase, a tumor suppressor and TCA cycle component, confers resistance to cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis. Collectively, this work demonstrates the crucial role of mitochondria in cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis and implicates ferroptosis in tumor suppression."	0

We uncovered a cyclin docking motif, LxF, that mediates binding of replication factor Cdc6 to mitotic cyclin. This interaction leads to phospho-adaptor Cks1-mediated inhibition of M-CDK to facilitate Cdc6 accumulation and sequestration in mitosis. The LxF motif and Cks1 also mediate the mutual inhibition between M-CDK and the tyrosine kinase Swe1.

We use the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia to identify processes that initiate Wnt signaling during posterior regeneration and find that the ligand wnt-3 is upregulated early in posterior-facing wounds. Functional studies reveal that wnt-3 is required to regenerate posterior tissues. wnt-3 is expressed in stem cells, it is needed for their proliferation, and its function is stem cell dependent. Chromatin accessibility data reveal that wnt-3 activation requires input from the general wound response. In addition, the expression of a different Wnt ligand, wnt-1, before amputation is required for wound-induced activation of wnt-3.

SAUR19 subfamily genes have asymmetric expression in Arabidopsis hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, induced by the lateral redistribution of auxin. Both the mutation of SAUR19 subfamily genes and the ectopic expression of SAUR19 weaken these tropic responses, indicating the critical role of their asymmetric expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor ARF7 may directly bind the SAUR19 promoter and activate SAUR19 expression asymmetrically in tropic responses. Taken together, our results reveal that a gravity- or light-triggered asymmetric auxin distribution induces the asymmetric expression of SAUR19 subfamily genes by ARF7 and ARF19 in the hypocotyls, which leads to bending growth during gravitropic and phototropic responses."	1
"32553154"	"Combinatorial Developmental Controls on Striatonigral Circuits.Cortical pyramidal cells are generated locally, from pre-programmed progenitors, to form functionally distinct areas. By contrast, striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are generated remotely from a common source, undergo migration to form mosaics of striosomes and matrix, and become incorporated into functionally distinct sectors. Striatal circuits might thus have a unique logic of developmental organization, distinct from those of the neocortex. We explore this possibility in mice by mapping one set of SPNs, those in striosomes, with striatonigral projections to the dopamine-containing substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Same-age SPNs exhibit topographic striatonigral projections, according to their resident sector. However, the different birth dates of resident SPNs within a given sector specify the destination of their axons within the SNpc. These findings highlight a logic intercalating birth date-dependent and birth date-independent factors in determining the trajectories of SPN axons and organizing specialized units of striatonigral circuitry that could influence behavioral expression and vulnerabilities to disease."	0
"32460015"	"Combined TP53 and RB1 Loss Promotes Prostate Cancer Resistance to a Spectrum of Therapeutics and Confers Vulnerability to Replication Stress.Prostate cancers (PCs) with loss of the potent tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 exhibit poor outcomes. TP53 and RB1 also influence cell plasticity and are frequently lost in PCs with neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Therapeutic strategies that address these aggressive variant PCs are urgently needed. Using deep genomic profiling of 410 metastatic biopsies, we determine the relationships between combined TP53 and RB1 loss and PC phenotypes. Notably, 40% of TP53/RB1-deficient tumors are classified as AR-active adenocarcinomas, indicating that NE differentiation is not an obligate consequence of TP53/RB1 inactivation. A gene expression signature reflecting TP53/RB1 loss is associated with diminished responses to AR antagonists and reduced survival. These tumors exhibit high proliferation rates and evidence of elevated DNA repair processes. While tumor cells lacking TP53/RB1 are highly resistant to all single-agent therapeutics tested, the combination of PARP and ATR inhibition is found to produce significant responses, reflecting a clinically exploitable vulnerability resulting from replication stress."	0
"32023451"	"A Positive Feedback Loop of TET3 and TGF-β1 Promotes Liver Fibrosis.Pathological activation of TGF-β signaling is universal in fibrosis. Aberrant TGF-β signaling in conjunction with transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into fibrogenic myofibroblasts plays a central role in liver fibrosis. Here we report that the DNA demethylase TET3 is anomalously upregulated in fibrotic livers in both humans and mice. We demonstrate that in human HSCs, TET3 promotes profibrotic gene expression by upregulation of multiple key TGF-β pathway genes, including TGFB1. TET3 binds to target gene promoters, inducing demethylation, which in turn facilitates chromatin remodeling and transcription. We also reveal a positive feedback loop between TGF-β1 and TET3 in both HSCs and hepatocytes. Furthermore, TET3 knockdown ameliorates liver fibrosis in mice. Our results uncover a TET3/TGF-β1 positive feedback loop as a crucial determinant of liver fibrosis and suggest that inhibiting TET3 may represent a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis and perhaps other fibrotic diseases."	1
"31100245"	"Where, When, and How: Context-Dependent Functions of RNA Methylation Writers, Readers, and Erasers.Cellular RNAs are naturally decorated with a variety of chemical modifications. The structural diversity of the modified nucleosides provides regulatory potential to sort groups of RNAs for organized metabolism and functions, thus affecting gene expression. Recent years have witnessed a burst of interest in and understanding of RNA modification biology, thanks to the emerging transcriptome-wide sequencing methods for mapping modified sites, highly sensitive mass spectrometry for precise modification detection and quantification, and extensive characterization of the modification ""effectors,"" including enzymes (""writers"" and ""erasers"") that alter the modification level and binding proteins (""readers"") that recognize the chemical marks. However, challenges remain due to the vast heterogeneity in expression abundance of different RNA species, further complicated by divergent cell-type-specific and tissue-specific expression and localization of the effectors as well as modifications. In this review, we highlight recent progress in understanding the function of N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), the most abundant internal mark on eukaryotic mRNA, in light of the specific biological contexts of m<sup>6</sup>A effectors. We emphasize the importance of context for RNA modification regulation and function."	0
"32209481"	"c-Src Promotes Tumorigenesis and Tumor Progression by Activating PFKFB3.Reprogramming of glucose metabolism is a key event in tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we show that active c-Src stimulates glycolysis by phosphorylating (Tyr194) and activating PFKFB3, a key enzyme that boosts glycolysis by producing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and activating PFK1. Increased glycolysis intermediates replenish non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine pathway for biosynthesis of cancer cells. PFKFB3 knockout (KO) cells and their counterpart reconstituted with PFKFB3-Y194F show comparably impaired abilities for proliferation, migration, and xenograft formation. Furthermore, PFKFB3-Y194F knockin mice show impaired glycolysis and, mating of these mice with APC<sup>min/+</sup> mice attenuates spontaneous colon cancer formation in APC<sup>min/+</sup> mice. In summary, we identify a specific mechanism by which c-Src mediates glucose metabolism to meet cancer cells' requirements for maximal biosynthesis and proliferation. The PFKFB3-Tyr194 phosphorylation level highly correlates with c-Src activity in clinical tumor samples, indicating its potential as an evaluation for tumor prognosis."	1
"32160544"	"Glioblastoma Cell Resistance to EGFR and MET Inhibition Can Be Overcome via Blockade of FGFR-SPRY2 Bypass Signaling.SPRY2 is a purported tumor suppressor in certain cancers that promotes tumor growth and resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in glioblastoma. Here, we identify a SPRY2-dependent bypass signaling mechanism in glioblastoma that drives resistance to EGFR and MET inhibition. In glioblastoma cells treated with EGFR and MET inhibitors, SPRY2 expression is initially suppressed but eventually rebounds due to NF-κB pathway activation, resultant autocrine FGFR activation, and reactivation of ERK, which controls SPRY2 transcription. In cells where FGFR autocrine signaling does not occur and ERK does not reactivate, or in which ERK reactivates but SPRY2 cannot be expressed, EGFR and MET inhibitors are more effective at promoting death. The same mechanism also drives acquired resistance to EGFR and MET inhibition. Furthermore, tumor xenografts expressing an ERK-dependent bioluminescent reporter engineered for these studies reveal that this bypass resistance mechanism plays out in vivo but can be overcome through simultaneous FGFR inhibition."	1
"32315601"	"MYC Controls the Epstein-Barr Virus Lytic Switch.Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple human malignancies. To evade immune detection, EBV switches between latent and lytic programs. How viral latency is maintained in tumors or in memory B cells, the reservoir for lifelong EBV infection, remains incompletely understood. To gain insights, we performed a human genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in Burkitt lymphoma B cells. Our analyses identified a network of host factors that repress lytic reactivation, centered on the transcription factor MYC, including cohesins, FACT, STAGA, and Mediator. Depletion of MYC or factors important for MYC expression reactivated the lytic cycle, including in Burkitt xenografts. MYC bound the EBV genome origin of lytic replication and suppressed its looping to the lytic cycle initiator BZLF1 promoter. Notably, MYC abundance decreases with plasma cell differentiation, a key lytic reactivation trigger. Our results suggest that EBV senses MYC abundance as a readout of B cell state and highlights Burkitt latency reversal therapeutic targets."	0
"32755582"	"Altered MICOS Morphology and Mitochondrial Ion Homeostasis Contribute to Poly(GR) Toxicity Associated with C9-ALS/FTD.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) manifests pathological changes in motor neurons and various other cell types. Compared to motor neurons, the contribution of the other cell types to the ALS phenotypes is understudied. G4C2 repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS along with frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), with increasing evidence supporting repeat-encoded poly(GR) in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show in Drosophila muscle that poly(GR) enters mitochondria and interacts with components of the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS), altering MICOS dynamics and intra-subunit interactions. This impairs mitochondrial inner membrane structure, ion homeostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and muscle integrity. Similar mitochondrial defects are observed in patient fibroblasts. Genetic manipulation of MICOS components or pharmacological restoration of ion homeostasis with nigericin effectively rescue the mitochondrial pathology and disease phenotypes in both systems. These results implicate MICOS-regulated ion homeostasis in C9-ALS pathogenesis and suggest potential new therapeutic strategies."	0
"32668252"	"Heterogeneous Effects of Calorie Content and Nutritional Components Underlie Dietary Influence on Pancreatic Cancer Susceptibility.Pancreatic cancer is a rare but fatal form of cancer, the fourth highest in absolute mortality. Known risk factors include obesity, diet, and type 2 diabetes; however, the low incidence rate and interconnection of these factors confound the isolation of individual effects. Here, we use epidemiological analysis of prospective human cohorts and parallel tracking of pancreatic cancer in mice to dissect the effects of obesity, diet, and diabetes on pancreatic cancer. Through longitudinal monitoring and multi-omics analysis in mice, we found distinct effects of protein, sugar, and fat dietary components, with dietary sugars increasing Mad2l1 expression and tumor proliferation. Using epidemiological approaches in humans, we find that dietary sugars give a MAD2L1 genotype-dependent increased susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. The translation of these results to a clinical setting could aid in the identification of the at-risk population for screening and potentially harness dietary modification as a therapeutic measure."	0
"32101756"	"SEEDSTICK Controls Arabidopsis Fruit Size by Regulating Cytokinin Levels and FRUITFULL.Upon fertilization, the ovary increases in size and undergoes a complex developmental process to become a fruit. We show that cytokinins (CKs), which are required to determine ovary size before fertilization, have to be degraded to facilitate fruit growth. The expression of CKX7, which encodes a cytosolic CK-degrading enzyme, is directly positively regulated post-fertilization by the MADS-box transcription factor STK. Similar to stk, two ckx7 mutants possess shorter fruits than wild type. Quantification of CKs reveals that stk and ckx7 mutants have high CK levels, which negatively control cell expansion during fruit development, compromising fruit growth. Overexpression of CKX7 partially complements the stk fruit phenotype, confirming a role for CK degradation in fruit development. Finally, we show that STK is required for the expression of FUL, which is essential for valve elongation. Overall, we provide insights into the link between CKs and molecular pathways that control fruit growth."	0
"32579917"	"Local miRNA-Dependent Translational Control of GABA<sub>A</sub>R Synthesis during Inhibitory Long-Term Potentiation.Molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity at brain inhibitory synapses remain poorly characterized. Increased postsynaptic clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) rapidly strengthens inhibition during inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP). However, it is unclear how synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering is maintained to sustain iLTP. Here, we identify a role for miR376c in regulating the translation of mRNAs encoding the synaptic α1 and γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits, GABRA1 and GABRG2, respectively. Following iLTP induction, transcriptional repression of miR376c is induced through a calcineurin-NFAT-HDAC signaling pathway and promotes increased translation and clustering of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. This pathway is essential for the long-term expression of iLTP and is blocked by miR376c overexpression, specifically impairing inhibitory synaptic strength. Finally, we show that local de novo synthesis of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs occurs exclusively in dendrites and in a miR376c-dependent manner following iLTP. Together, this work describes a local post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates inhibitory synaptic plasticity via miRNA control of dendritic protein synthesis."	1
"32017897"	"Structure-Mediated RNA Decay by UPF1 and G3BP1.Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the stability and, hence, expression of coding and noncoding RNAs. Sequence-specific features within the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) often direct mRNAs for decay. Here, we characterize a genome-wide RNA decay pathway that reduces the half-lives of mRNAs based on overall 3' UTR structure formed by base pairing. The decay pathway is independent of specific single-stranded sequences, as regulation is maintained in both the original and reverse complement orientation. Regulation can be compromised by reducing the overall structure by fusing the 3' UTR with an unstructured sequence. Mutating base-paired RNA regions can also compromise this structure-mediated regulation, which can be restored by re-introducing base-paired structures of different sequences. The decay pathway requires the RNA-binding protein UPF1 and its associated protein G3BP1. Depletion of either protein increased steady-state levels of mRNAs with highly structured 3' UTRs as well as highly structured circular RNAs. This structure-dependent mechanism therefore enables cells to selectively regulate coding and noncoding RNAs."	0
"32268086"	"Precise Tuning of Cortical Contractility Regulates Cell Shape during Cytokinesis.The mechanical properties of the actin cortex regulate shape changes during cell division, cell migration, and tissue morphogenesis. We show that modulation of myosin II (MII) filament composition allows tuning of surface tension at the cortex to maintain cell shape during cytokinesis. Our results reveal that MIIA generates cortex tension, while MIIB acts as a stabilizing motor and its inclusion in MII hetero-filaments reduces cortex tension. Tension generation by MIIA drives faster cleavage furrow ingression and bleb formation. We also show distinct roles for the motor and tail domains of MIIB in maintaining cytokinetic fidelity. Maintenance of cortical stability by the motor domain of MIIB safeguards against shape instability-induced chromosome missegregation, while its tail domain mediates cortical localization at the terminal stages of cytokinesis to mediate cell abscission. Because most non-muscle contractile systems are cortical, this tuning mechanism will likely be applicable to numerous processes driven by myosin-II contractility."	0
"32554807"	"δ-Catenin engages the autophagy pathway to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor.The development of the dendritic arbor in pyramidal neurons is critical for neural circuit function. Here, we uncovered a pathway in which δ-catenin, a component of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex, promotes coordination of growth among individual dendrites and engages the autophagy mechanism to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor. Using a rat primary neuron model, time-lapse imaging, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy, we found that apical and basolateral dendrites are coordinately sculpted during development. Loss or knockdown of δ-catenin uncoupled this coordination, leading to retraction of the apical dendrite without altering basolateral dendrite dynamics. Autophagy is a key cellular pathway that allows degradation of cellular components. We observed that the impairment of the dendritic arbor resulting from δ-catenin knockdown could be reversed by knockdown of autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), a component of the autophagy machinery. We propose that δ-catenin regulates the dendritic arbor by coordinating the dynamics of individual dendrites and that the autophagy mechanism may be leveraged by δ-catenin and other effectors to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor. Our findings have implications for the management of neurological disorders, such as autism and intellectual disability, that are characterized by dendritic aberrations."	0
"32375036"	"Antagonistic Center-Surround Mechanisms for Direction Selectivity in the Retina.An antagonistic center-surround receptive field is a key feature in sensory processing, but how it contributes to specific computations such as direction selectivity is often unknown. Retinal On-starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which mediate direction selectivity in direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), exhibit antagonistic receptive field organization: depolarizing to light increments and decrements in their center and surround, respectively. We find that a repetitive stimulation exhausts SAC center and enhances its surround and use it to study how center-surround responses contribute to direction selectivity. Center, but not surround, activation induces direction-selective responses in SACs. Nevertheless, both SAC center and surround elicited direction-selective responses in DSGCs, but to opposite directions. Physiological and modeling data suggest that the opposing direction selectivity can result from inverted temporal balance between excitation and inhibition in DSGCs, implying that SAC's response timing dictates direction selectivity. Our findings reveal antagonistic center-surround mechanisms for direction selectivity and demonstrate how context-dependent receptive field reorganization enables flexible computations."	0
"32719012"	"A cytoskeletal protein complex is essential for division of intracellular amastigotes of <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>.Previous studies in <i>Leishmania mexicana</i> have identified the cytoskeletal protein KHARON as being important for both flagellar trafficking of the glucose transporter GT1 and for successful cytokinesis and survival of infectious amastigote forms inside mammalian macrophages. KHARON is located in three distinct regions of the cytoskeleton: the base of the flagellum, the subpellicular microtubules, and the mitotic spindle. To deconvolve the different functions for KHARON, we have identified two partner proteins, KHAP1 and KHAP2, which associate with KHARON. KHAP1 is located only in the subpellicular microtubules, whereas KHAP2 is located at the subpellicular microtubules and the base of the flagellum. Both <i>KHAP1</i> and <i>KHAP2</i> null mutants are unable to execute cytokinesis but are able to traffic GT1 to the flagellum. These results confirm that KHARON assembles into distinct functional complexes and that the subpellicular complex is essential for cytokinesis and viability of disease-causing amastigotes but not for flagellar membrane trafficking."	0
"32492425"	"Analysis of Genetically Regulated Gene Expression Identifies a Prefrontal PTSD Gene, SNRNP35, Specific to Military Cohorts.To reveal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetic risk influences on tissue-specific gene expression, we use brain and non-brain transcriptomic imputation. We impute genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) in 29,539 PTSD cases and 166,145 controls from 70 ancestry-specific cohorts and identify 18 significant GReX-PTSD associations corresponding to specific tissue-gene pairs. The results suggest substantial genetic heterogeneity based on ancestry, cohort type (military versus civilian), and sex. Two study-wide significant PTSD associations are identified in European and military European cohorts; ZNF140 is predicted to be upregulated in whole blood, and SNRNP35 is predicted to be downregulated in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. In peripheral leukocytes from 175 marines, the observed PTSD differential gene expression correlates with the predicted differences for these individuals, and deployment stress produces glucocorticoid-regulated expression changes that include downregulation of both ZNF140 and SNRNP35. SNRNP35 knockdown in cells validates its functional role in U12-intron splicing. Finally, exogenous glucocorticoids in mice downregulate prefrontal Snrnp35 expression."	0
"32540967"	"New analysis pipeline for high-throughput domain-peptide affinity experiments improves SH2 interaction data.Protein domain interactions with short linear peptides, such as those of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain with phosphotyrosine-containing peptide motifs (pTyr), are ubiquitous and important to many biochemical processes of the cell. The desire to map and quantify these interactions has resulted in the development of high-throughput (HTP) quantitative measurement techniques, such as microarray or fluorescence polarization assays. For example, in the last 15 years, experiments have progressed from measuring single interactions to covering 500,000 of the 5.5 million possible SH2-pTyr interactions in the human proteome. However, high variability in affinity measurements and disagreements about positive interactions between published data sets led us here to reevaluate the analysis methods and raw data of published SH2-pTyr HTP experiments. We identified several opportunities for improving the identification of positive and negative interactions and the accuracy of affinity measurements. We implemented model-fitting techniques that are more statistically appropriate for the nonlinear SH2-pTyr interaction data. We also developed a method to account for protein concentration errors due to impurities and degradation or protein inactivity and aggregation. Our revised analysis increases the reported affinity accuracy, reduces the false-negative rate, and increases the amount of useful data by adding reliable true-negative results. We demonstrate improvement in classification of binding <i>versus</i> nonbinding when using machine-learning techniques, suggesting improved coherence in the reanalyzed data sets. We present revised SH2-pTyr affinity results and propose a new analysis pipeline for future HTP measurements of domain-peptide interactions."	0
